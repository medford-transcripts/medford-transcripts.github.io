    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1133.124s">[Graham]</a>: So are you saying that that's because there's a data reporting issue, or are you saying that's because we just suspend everyone out of school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1144.671s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not clear what your conclusion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1173.755s">[Graham]</a>: So are you saying, I'm looking at, I think I'm looking at what you're referring to, Paul, and I'm looking at a grid that starts with all students and then it breaks down into subgroups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1184.339s">[Graham]</a>: All students, 1,400 students for the 18-19 school year, 112 students disciplined, 0% in school suspension, 8% out of school suspension, 0% expulsion, 0% alternate setting, 0% emergency removal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1204.112s">[Graham]</a>: 0% students with school-based arrest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1206.554s">[Graham]</a>: So are you saying that that 8% should be distributed across all of those columns and that we are not accurately like categorizing and classifying what we're doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1217.343s">[Graham]</a>: Or are you saying we simply don't do those other things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1248.946s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1249.307s">[Graham]</a>: So, the data, it's not a data issue then, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1253.309s">[Graham]</a>: So, what you're saying is there aren't expulsions, so 0% makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1258.3s">[Graham]</a>: Um, there aren't alternate settings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1259.982s">[Graham]</a>: So 0% makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1261.203s">[Graham]</a>: So, so this date, what this data says is that 8% of students receive out of 1400, 8% or 112 received an out of school suspension in the 2018, 2019 school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1270.77s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1271.571s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1271.691s">[Graham]</a>: And this resolution is saying, we want that number to be zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1288.211s">[Graham]</a>: in favor of pick a different category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1294.175s">[Graham]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1313.989s">[Graham]</a>: I can try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1316.087s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1317.268s">[Graham]</a>: Let me try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1319.83s">[Graham]</a>: I think I have it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1320.711s">[Graham]</a>: Let me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1326.856s">[Graham]</a>: Can you see something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1331.22s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1331.58s">[Graham]</a>: Can you see a chart that says 2018-2019 student discipline data report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1339.246s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1340.908s">[Graham]</a>: I've got two screens, and I don't even know what I'm sharing at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1343.73s">[Graham]</a>: So tell me if it's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1345.586s">[Graham]</a>: Not that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1348.168s">[Graham]</a>: So Melanie, I was reading across this top line, this all students line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1355.012s">[Graham]</a>: And so what we're saying is the goal is to take this 8% to zero and to either move the punishment, I guess I'll call it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1370.871s">[Graham]</a>: to a setting where we can be focused on some of the things that Paul was saying we used to do and we don't do anymore, focusing on the rehabilitative aspects of what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1384.619s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's what we're trying to accomplish with this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1975.803s">[Graham]</a>: 75% of students are high needs students who are disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1978.544s">[Graham]</a>: So of 112, 84 is 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1978.985s">[Graham]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1987.206s">[Graham]</a>: 75% of students who are disciplined are high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2215.311s">[Graham]</a>: Stacey, I actually think that that is the right way to go about getting at number five on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2225.417s">[Graham]</a>: So I still don't think that ending out of school suspensions is a bad sort of number one place to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2235.502s">[Graham]</a>: But in terms of being able to accurately identify number five, an in-depth program review, so would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2244.304s">[Graham]</a>: allow us to look at the data, as you said, like I agree, I think there's lots of data missing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2250.348s">[Graham]</a>: Like I would like to see lots more data than is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2253.81s">[Graham]</a>: So what I would suggest member Russo is that between four and five, we add something that says the administration will complete a comprehensive program review to identify the causes of suspension, as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2273.079s">[Graham]</a>: recommend mitigation efforts so that number five can actually happen, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2278.204s">[Graham]</a>: Because otherwise, we're just throwing a number at the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2282.688s">[Graham]</a>: And we don't know if it's enough or if it's not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2285.75s">[Graham]</a>: But if we say, here's our problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2289.554s">[Graham]</a>: Here's what it's going to take to address our problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2292.296s">[Graham]</a>: And here's the money that we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2295.079s">[Graham]</a>: Now we have an actual path forward that is actionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2301.383s">[Graham]</a>: So that would be my suggestion is that we add that as another bullet in terms of what will happen to get us to this place next fall, where we do not want to be issuing out of school suspensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2420.362s">[Graham]</a>: But this resolution stops out-of-school suspensions at the start of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2428.347s">[Graham]</a>: So nothing is immediately happening is my read on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2431.509s">[Graham]</a>: Is that correct, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2436.833s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2437.788s">[Graham]</a>: So I mean, nobody is suggesting that this happened tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3146.789s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to, while we were talking, when I think about accountability, I think about our accountability to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3156.515s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we certainly have a responsibility to follow the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3162.579s">[Graham]</a>: And it's my understanding that those violence issues, particularly that Nadine was talking about, would be cared for under the law and would not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3175.686s">[Graham]</a>: this would not supersede any requirements that we have under the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3178.969s">[Graham]</a>: So, so there is that, but I also think accountability means figuring out how to not repeat the same situations that sort of escalate, particularly amongst students of color, but for any student at that, for that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3198.185s">[Graham]</a>: And to make sure that we are doing the things that, that we need to do as a district,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3203.629s">[Graham]</a>: to deescalate those issues and to help those students sort of assess why their behavior is sort of leading to this place and get them on a better path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3217.656s">[Graham]</a>: But while we were talking, I looked at some other districts and I just wanted to note that Arlington High's out of school suspension rate is 2.1% to our eight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3233.715s">[Graham]</a>: I'm looking at Malden right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3239.678s">[Graham]</a>: Malden's out of school suspension rate is 7.9% at Malden High to our 8 point something percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3250.664s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, I just think we have an obligation to try to do better than we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3259.386s">[Graham]</a>: I think we all agree on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3261.167s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't know why there's so much resistance to saying we're gonna make a goal and move towards that goal in a meaningful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3269.29s">[Graham]</a>: And frankly, to put the school committee on the hook for the resources and the prioritization of these goals, which is our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3277.934s">[Graham]</a>: So it is our job to decide what those priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3283.177s">[Graham]</a>: Obviously with a lot of input and direction from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3286.832s">[Graham]</a>: all of the administrators on the phone, which is frankly shocking given that school goes back tomorrow, that you all are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3295.256s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanna point out that it feels like you're all here because you're here to tell us that we're wrong and that out of school suspensions are not a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3303.8s">[Graham]</a>: And maybe that's not exactly why you're all here, but I would like to see us all get to a place where we can agree that goals are okay to have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3313.483s">[Graham]</a>: And that in terms of working to achieve a goal, accountability is critically important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3322.129s">[Graham]</a>: And that is on both the student and on incumbent on us to set those priorities and to do what we can to mitigate out of school suspensions in total, but also specifically for students who are disproportionately being suspended out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3343.803s">[Graham]</a>: I'll stop there, but I just wanted to point out that it feels like you're all very against this, and I really haven't heard anybody say why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4332.779s">[Graham]</a>: Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4336.802s">[Graham]</a>: I think that the edits that the superintendent shared, I'm generally fine with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4342.766s">[Graham]</a>: I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4343.658s">[Graham]</a>: still ask that a program review be formally added to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4348.701s">[Graham]</a>: And I would like to see the program review be about discipline in a broader sense than simply out of school suspension, because I think Maria is right that it's, we can't just feel good about solving like this tiny piece of the problem so that our metrics look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4367.29s">[Graham]</a>: Like I want us to be endeavoring to do better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4373.126s">[Graham]</a>: sort of overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4374.006s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that that program review has to be a little bit more, um, sort of broad in its, um, in its review of discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4383.108s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and I mean, that could include everything like up to and including taking recess away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4390.309s">[Graham]</a>: And we have, uh, we have a resolution that is tabled about recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4394.97s">[Graham]</a>: Um, it continues to be a point of pain at the elementary schools, and maybe it's not like the most immediate thing because we're not going back into a school building tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4403.491s">[Graham]</a>: but it's a form of discipline that begins at the elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4408.133s">[Graham]</a>: So I would like to still see us add that program review and craft some language that casts like a broader net so that we can address discipline in a comprehensive sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4420.597s">[Graham]</a>: And then I think to Mr. Murphy's point, there should be a number seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4425.558s">[Graham]</a>: So we're up to seven now that establishes some sort of reporting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4430.916s">[Graham]</a>: on an annual basis where we all reflect upon ourselves about, are we making the right progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4438.961s">[Graham]</a>: Are our programs working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4442.303s">[Graham]</a>: It sounds to me like it has to be a little bit more detailed in some way, and perhaps the program review can recommend what that way is, but I think that data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4454.171s">[Graham]</a>: is informative to us to say are the programs that we're funding effective, but I think that data also needs to be parsed and provided in a feedback loop to those people issuing the discipline so that they can understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4471.115s">[Graham]</a>: What discipline are they delivering and how does that compare to the system overall so that we can help people be aware of their unconscious biases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4483.478s">[Graham]</a>: Because it's not a criticism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4485.679s">[Graham]</a>: I mean, it is a criticism and it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4487.499s">[Graham]</a>: We all have those and we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4491.869s">[Graham]</a>: need to be willing to look at how those are playing out in real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4495.91s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that that reporting mechanism needs to allow our staff to reflect on their own kind of part in this process, and not in a disciplinary way, but in a I think we all want to be better at our jobs kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4512.423s">[Graham]</a>: but that reporting should be informative in the macro level program sense, but also in the individual sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4519.39s">[Graham]</a>: And that's when I think data and reporting sort of meet together to provide something really meaningful that can help us move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4527.838s">[Graham]</a>: So those will be my two additions to what the superintendent shared as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5383.933s">[Graham]</a>: So I just, um, I sent these to, uh, to member McLaughlin, but I just wanted to, um, read them out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5392.721s">[Graham]</a>: Um, because as I was typing, I was like riffing a little bit over what I said earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5399.087s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure I was clear about what this says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5402.15s">[Graham]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5403.55s">[Graham]</a>: On the program review, the administration will complete a comprehensive program review of disciplinary practices across the district, including, but not limited to the use of out-of-school suspensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5412.798s">[Graham]</a>: The program review will recommend mitigation and improvement strategies and will provide specific recommendations on how student victims are supported through our disciplinary practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5423.187s">[Graham]</a>: So that does resonate with me as a woman, as somebody who,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5431.775s">[Graham]</a>: you know, women often are in a position where they are the victim, and there's very little recourse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5440.257s">[Graham]</a>: And the likelihood of, you know, it sounds like we are lucky that we don't have sexual assaults in our midst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5449.74s">[Graham]</a>: If that's true, I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5452.001s">[Graham]</a>: If it's not true, we need to be committed to reporting those as they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5458.482s">[Graham]</a>: But the vast majority of those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5461.044s">[Graham]</a>: those situations if they occur, that student who assaulted another student, particularly a woman, is going to be right back in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5471.708s">[Graham]</a>: So I do want us to be focused in our program review on not just the discipline part of it, but how are we supporting those students who are victims?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5483.973s">[Graham]</a>: Because I do think they're important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5485.654s">[Graham]</a>: And the goal of reducing out-of-school suspensions is not to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5491.798s">[Graham]</a>: ignore the importance of the victims in a particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5496.602s">[Graham]</a>: So I want there to be some focus and some time spent on how we are supporting students who may fall into that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5504.529s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other piece was about the reporting requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5510.27s">[Graham]</a>: The program review will identify annual reporting requirements that include, but is not limited to, system-wide disciplinary measures reporting to the school committee, as well as establishing a staff feedback process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5522.734s">[Graham]</a>: And to Tony's point earlier, most people don't have the luxury of seeing this stuff in action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5533.354s">[Graham]</a>: or the misfortune of seeing this stuff in action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5535.779s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know what the right qualifier is there, but what I would say is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5542.975s">[Graham]</a>: It's not shocking to me that our reporting is totally inadequate on this front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5548.799s">[Graham]</a>: I think as a district, we lack systemic support for the work that you guys do every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5556.525s">[Graham]</a>: And we need to commit to providing you the kind of support that would allow you to be able to describe those things in a consistent way and in a uniform way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5566.432s">[Graham]</a>: so that when people ask about what's happening, there's a way that you can provide that information that doesn't require 25 people on a Zoom sharing anecdotal stories, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5579.463s">[Graham]</a>: But instead that there's some way that the reporting mechanisms you guys use provide you sufficient space and detail to be able to tell us what's happening and to aggregate it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5594.249s">[Graham]</a>: Because for all kinds of reasons, we're not all like right there in the thick of those situations as they happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5601.623s">[Graham]</a>: But it doesn't mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5606.618s">[Graham]</a>: people don't care or that people don't want to know, I just think it simply means that they're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5611.419s">[Graham]</a>: And so the reporting and the systemic support of the work you guys are doing in that moment has to be there and it has to be easy for you all to comply with and be accurate about, otherwise it's not worth doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5625.643s">[Graham]</a>: And I have no idea how you report this stuff, but I continue to get mimeographed pages home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5633.885s">[Graham]</a>: from 1982, and I'm just here to say that it's probably consistent that we need to do better as a district in giving you guys the systemic support that you need to do what we're asking you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6205.326s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6208.347s">[Graham]</a>: Tomorrow's a big day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6209.167s">[Graham]</a>: We're finally here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6210.487s">[Graham]</a>: So it's very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6211.687s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6212.908s">[Graham]</a>: And I would make a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6241.166s">[Graham]</a>: I've got to go read my fourth grade and sixth grade packets, so I'll be busy tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6245.811s">[Graham]</a>: Goodnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6247.161s">[Graham]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6247.967s">[Graham]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2077.892s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2078.352s">[Graham]</a>: I'm really excited to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2080.933s">[Graham]</a>: I know we've talked about this a couple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2083.434s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of questions I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2085.495s">[Graham]</a>: If somebody would like to participate on the curriculum review team, who do they reach out to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2093.599s">[Graham]</a>: And how will the community that may not be watching the school committee meeting know to engage in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2110.574s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2111.634s">[Graham]</a>: And does the HECAT require that the sexual health evaluation be evidence-based?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2166.992s">[Graham]</a>: And the other question I had looking at the timeline, just thinking about the potential budget implications, if you all aren't formulating your responses or your recommendations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2180.161s">[Graham]</a>: until the June timeframe, it sounds like there just may be a mismatch in terms of what we may or may not need from a budget standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2191.09s">[Graham]</a>: And I didn't know if you took that into consideration when you put the timeline together or if you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2197.735s">[Graham]</a>: And a couple of the things that I think about really specifically are from an implementation perspective, the middle school students who don't get health because they go to band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2209.605s">[Graham]</a>: you know, the need for health teach credentialed health teachers that we may or may not have in the district at all levels and how that fits into our staffing and our scheduling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2220.756s">[Graham]</a>: And I just feel like there could be like a whole slew of implications from a budget perspective that we would want to be able to prioritize as quickly as possible, because I think this is long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2232.577s">[Graham]</a>: if we never show those crazy videos to the fifth graders, again, from Proctor and Gamble, it will be too soon for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2238.958s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that there's nothing at the end of this process that sort of delays our ability to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2245.76s">[Graham]</a>: Because I do think, at least for me, this is a huge priority for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2249.281s">[Graham]</a>: And it is, as you mentioned, like the last man standing around curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2254.702s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we may not be willing to wait for the legislature, for DESE,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2261.633s">[Graham]</a>: for the legislature to step in and say, this has to be a priority for districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2265.897s">[Graham]</a>: So I think our kids need this information and this education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2270.581s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanna make sure that whatever we can do to clear the path, that we're doing it proactively for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4045.272s">[Graham]</a>: Can you tell us that I'm looking at the charter numbers for enrollment this year so 3.95 is our charter school enrollment and I think that amounts to 7 or 8 million dollars of tuition going out to those charter schools has that compared to your past the 3.95 do you know sorry could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4066.43s">[Graham]</a>: How does the 395 compare to years past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.428s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6301.888s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to give you a little break here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6304.87s">[Graham]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules and take items eight and 10 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7141.321s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7143.202s">[Graham]</a>: First, I want to say thank you to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7145.123s">[Graham]</a>: Branley for coming tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7148.652s">[Graham]</a>: It's really hard to speak in front of a large room of people like this, and it's especially hard to deliver the remarks you just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7156.397s">[Graham]</a>: I am really terribly sorry that your family is going through this, and I hope that as we navigate beyond this, that you will find what you're looking for in terms of change in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7173.528s">[Graham]</a>: Having said that, regarding this motion, give me a second,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7184.683s">[Graham]</a>: When we introduced this climate and culture assessment, it was unanimously approved last fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7189.945s">[Graham]</a>: And it was at least in part a reaction to an incident last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7193.105s">[Graham]</a>: The intent of the motion was not last year was not to narrowly or exclusively address the incident itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7200.972s">[Graham]</a>: I will say that safety and supervision are foundational in daily activities at any school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7205.256s">[Graham]</a>: It's reasonable to assume that any school has the resources, staff, and structures necessary to perform these basic school functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7212.382s">[Graham]</a>: And when the system doesn't work at these basic functions, it's reasonable to hold the system and the adults accountable for the kind of failure that we see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7223.971s">[Graham]</a>: Separately, the point of the climate and culture assessment, for me at least,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7228.092s">[Graham]</a>: is to take a broader look at our school environment and identify what keeps us from the kind of school we want for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7235.235s">[Graham]</a>: I want to hear from an expert in the field about how we create a culture that largely avoids these kinds of issues that we find ourselves in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7242.558s">[Graham]</a>: I want a system that avoids bullying, avoids contributing to the self-esteem issues we see in some kids, avoids process failures, avoids situations where kids can leave school unnoticed, and avoids the communication and PR situations we too often find ourselves in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7258.174s">[Graham]</a>: I want to hear from an expert about how to create that culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7261.676s">[Graham]</a>: I expect the recommendations to be quite broad and to address everything from staffing to org structure, to curriculum, to personnel, to policy, and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7270.82s">[Graham]</a>: We keep circling around real solutions that do more than react to a crisis of some kind in this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7276.363s">[Graham]</a>: At this point, I think we need to hear from an objective party that doesn't care where you are from, who you know, or why it's always been done that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7284.447s">[Graham]</a>: Our kids and our city in general deserve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7286.795s">[Graham]</a>: Of course, I would expect discipline to be part of that assessment, but I'll say again that safety and supervision are foundational elements of any school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7294.944s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think the district will ever provide a truly satisfying answer for all the privacy reasons that are wildly unpopular and still truly the law, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7306.697s">[Graham]</a>: I do hope that what we can expect from our superintendent and from this committee is accountability, that we will take action and expect more of this district in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7319.501s">[Graham]</a>: It's long past due that we push past the culture and change the culture of this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7325.642s">[Graham]</a>: It's been needed since long before my kids were a part of MPS, and one of them goes to high school next year, in fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7331.524s">[Graham]</a>: Our kids deserve the best we have to offer, and we need to explore every option to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7337.107s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of just one other note that I want to provide to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7341.988s">[Graham]</a>: Franley, the rules and policy subcommittee has on its docket a review of our bullying policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7349.15s">[Graham]</a>: And hopefully that meeting will be scheduled in the next coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7352.351s">[Graham]</a>: And when it is, we will be sure to reach out and let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7355.852s">[Graham]</a>: I think there's a lot that goes on from a policy perspective that then has to be executed by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7362.294s">[Graham]</a>: And when that comes up, we'll make sure that you're aware so you can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7366.464s">[Graham]</a>: But I do hope my colleagues will join me in again supporting this motion that asks for a detailed update on why this climate and culture assessment hasn't moved forward and what we are going to do to not be here again in three months or six months or a year, having this same conversation and not having done the things that are at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7385.621s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7479.861s">[Graham]</a>: Yep, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7525.863s">[Graham]</a>: That couldn't be further from the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7527.324s">[Graham]</a>: I've been following up on it since we asked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7531.127s">[Graham]</a>: And I just think it's important for the entire community to be able to hear that same update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7536.657s">[Graham]</a>: that we committee members often get behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7538.959s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm hoping that the administration will have something to report to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7543.423s">[Graham]</a>: So it took 11 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7997.203s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7999.385s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9416.604s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor, Member Graham, I was curious what the testing results in the fall told you and what we need to know about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9589.235s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the other question I had, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9593.949s">[Graham]</a>: I don't even know if such a metric exists within math, but comparing to the national average is just a comparison of the average, but what RIT score is proficient?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9611.685s">[Graham]</a>: What should we be shooting for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9614.668s">[Graham]</a>: Just being the national average doesn't necessarily make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9620.779s">[Graham]</a>: give me like the warm fuzzies, but I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9622.84s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's the question I'm trying to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=579.402s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=823.295s">[Graham]</a>: Can I motion to waive the second reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=841.738s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, okay, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=842.859s">[Graham]</a>: Withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1952.752s">[Graham]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you Adam and Savannah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1956.471s">[Graham]</a>: Savannah and I live in the same neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1958.053s">[Graham]</a>: So and I happen to be home when when attacked place and I happen to be driving by as the police were responding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1966.02s">[Graham]</a>: So it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1969.363s">[Graham]</a>: But I sure I'm glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood because that would have been terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1975.429s">[Graham]</a>: But thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1977.831s">[Graham]</a>: It's really important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1979.213s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.1s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.56s">[Graham]</a>: I just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3855.362s">[Graham]</a>: This actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3875.15s">[Graham]</a>: Cabral brought this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3876.994s">[Graham]</a>: and I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3883.341s">[Graham]</a>: So can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3974.402s">[Graham]</a>: And so do you think that you can start this program next year and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3982.685s">[Graham]</a>: Is that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4034.479s">[Graham]</a>: I just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4039.11s">[Graham]</a>: project and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4045.552s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4058.476s">[Graham]</a>: that's since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4063.479s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm so happy that it's finally here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4065.74s">[Graham]</a>: And it's only been four and a half years, and it's not been a decade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4069.042s">[Graham]</a>: But I do want to sort of like we're all here, but this room is full, because we're having a budget presentation soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4075.285s">[Graham]</a>: So I would like to make a motion that Miss Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4094.45s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4099.36s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4555.984s">[Graham]</a>: Can I just interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4558.727s">[Graham]</a>: Just so that the committee knows why these folks are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4562.631s">[Graham]</a>: As we have been planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4565.915s">[Graham]</a>: For the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is fill out some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want them to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4582.894s">[Graham]</a>: And the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need programming space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4597.338s">[Graham]</a>: And MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will entertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4603.76s">[Graham]</a>: So Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4608.941s">[Graham]</a>: My hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to direct them to continue to explore these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4617.587s">[Graham]</a>: because that will be needed to send to the MSBA with our chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4633.251s">[Graham]</a>: So I will turn it over to Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4635.871s">[Graham]</a>: I just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5166.92s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5168.202s">[Graham]</a>: Um, in terms of the expansion of auto tech cosmetology, electrical and health assisting, can those expansions happen in the current space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5178.856s">[Graham]</a>: Or are you space constrained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5201.75s">[Graham]</a>: None of those are currently budgeted for FY25, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5220.223s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5221.785s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of the expansion of those programs, I would love to see a report at some point early next year about sort of a proposal from you all to implement those expansions like over the course of the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5238.129s">[Graham]</a>: number of years where space is not a constraint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5240.631s">[Graham]</a>: So obviously electrical would be a sort of a separate issue, but for the three shops where we could expand, what would you recommend that timeline be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5248.958s">[Graham]</a>: And do they all go at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5250.559s">[Graham]</a>: Does one come first or second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5252.701s">[Graham]</a>: But I would like to see that, you know, it does not have to be now, it does not have to be before the end of the year, but as we think about like next fall, really having you come to us with a sort of a proposal of like what we should be planning for and expecting in the coming years, if that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5267.625s">[Graham]</a>: very much so, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5268.566s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5269.787s">[Graham]</a>: And then I'm gonna make a motion that the school committee request that the MSBA explore the program expansions and new programs outlined in this presentation as part of the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5284.82s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5285.14s">[Graham]</a>: Did you get all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5304.501s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5306.342s">[Graham]</a>: Actually, can we roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5307.723s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5318.189s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, school building committee to feed the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5321.84s">[Graham]</a>: application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5322.541s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5328.367s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5919.698s">[Graham]</a>: So just so that everyone knows, thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5922.421s">[Graham]</a>: I know it's very hot in here and that's not on purpose, I promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5927.465s">[Graham]</a>: But I'm afraid to consider opening the windows because I don't think that'll work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5931.047s">[Graham]</a>: So hopefully we can just bear with the heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5935.631s">[Graham]</a>: Item number six is a budget update from Mr. Jerry McHugh, our Director of Finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5940.175s">[Graham]</a>: He's gonna provide his presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5942.116s">[Graham]</a>: I'm gonna let the committee ask some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5946.099s">[Graham]</a>: And get their questions answered and then we will be happy to take public comment from all of you I assume many of you are here to speak, just to set your expectations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5955.531s">[Graham]</a>: We do ask that folks speaking at public comment limit their comments to three minutes and one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5962.959s">[Graham]</a>: So please bear with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5966.773s">[Graham]</a>: Please feel free to speak from the heart or whatever it is that you need to speak from, but also just remember to do it briefly so that we can all have a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5978.242s">[Graham]</a>: So, Mr. McHugh, it's all yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6818.766s">[Graham]</a>: questions from the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6819.667s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7000.489s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Mr so before we continue talking about Mr so his motion is on the floor if there is a second it can stay on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7011.537s">[Graham]</a>: Second, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7013.419s">[Graham]</a>: But we're not going to take a vote on that until we have heard the questions of the rest of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7017.622s">[Graham]</a>: And we have heard from all of you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7022.185s">[Graham]</a>: Everyone can just take a breath, exhale, we're going to get to all of you before we get to any sort of voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7028.533s">[Graham]</a>: Mr so can you please sort of explain those numbers one more time just so that everybody understands what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7084.933s">[Graham]</a>: So before we take any vote, we'll make sure that we can look at that spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7088.156s">[Graham]</a>: So take your time, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7090.798s">[Graham]</a>: Are there questions from the rest of the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7094.093s">[Graham]</a>: Member Bradley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7250.23s">[Graham]</a>: Member Brantley, do you want the exact numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7252.131s">[Graham]</a>: I have the proposal from last week in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7363.115s">[Graham]</a>: Member Brantley, would you like the superintendent to weigh in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7366.918s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7368.379s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8089.983s">[Graham]</a>: Adjustment counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8091.525s">[Graham]</a>: I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8092.525s">[Graham]</a>: Bowen is saying no, you do not need to have an IEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8103.675s">[Graham]</a>: So the answer, just so that people that are on the phone can understand the questions and answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8109.119s">[Graham]</a>: The question was, do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment counselor or school psychologist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8113.763s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer to both is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8115.385s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8508.604s">[Graham]</a>: And if I can interrupt from the chair, for those of you who may be joining us for the first time, lucky you, because we do this every year and it is five years and counting of being pretty bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8522.289s">[Graham]</a>: So what we have tried to do in the last couple of years is do two things when we are talking about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8532.072s">[Graham]</a>: The first is to request<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8535.293s">[Graham]</a>: what we need from the municipal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8538.196s">[Graham]</a>: So that is the motion that Member Rousseau put on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8543.26s">[Graham]</a>: Then we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8545.612s">[Graham]</a>: wait patiently or impatiently, as it may be for the mayor to finish her work citywide, and for the council to pass their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8554.415s">[Graham]</a>: And once those two things happen, the preliminary number that was provided by the mayor under the budget ordinance by the city council was preliminary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8563.718s">[Graham]</a>: That means it's not final.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8566.019s">[Graham]</a>: So we will get a number through a past budget via the mayor and the city council at some point between now and the end of June,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8575.859s">[Graham]</a>: And at that time, we typically will pass a second request or a second motion that actually spends the money appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8585.824s">[Graham]</a>: So what Mr. Russo put on the floor tonight, just for you all to be clear, is our request to the municipal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8594.208s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think it outlines any cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8596.049s">[Graham]</a>: You said level service, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8619.952s">[Graham]</a>: And you can see that on the screen now so that request will go to the mayor, obviously she's here tonight but that will go to the mayor, it will go to the finance team at the city, it'll be considered by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8637.165s">[Graham]</a>: to the city council, they then we all have to let them do their work and wait patiently or impatiently depending on who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8646.071s">[Graham]</a>: And when they finish their work, they'll come back around to us and say here's your number, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8653.135s">[Graham]</a>: We will be back here if the number is not what we requested it never is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8659.441s">[Graham]</a>: And we will talk about like the brass tacks of exactly what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8663.805s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the process I just want to make sure everybody knows what that is, where we are right now is we're making a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8671.131s">[Graham]</a>: What Jerry has laid out is sort of something in the middle of like what we might request and what is responsive to that preliminary number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8679.813s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanna make sure everybody is clear on that before we take public comment, but there are no other comments from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8688.014s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo, did you have another comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8691.015s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8691.615s">[Graham]</a>: I just turned my mic off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8695.015s">[Graham]</a>: Member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9170.226s">[Graham]</a>: I think we have a question from our student reps too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9172.307s">[Graham]</a>: So Jerry, do you have an answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9258.018s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I can take a shot at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9259.279s">[Graham]</a>: How's that sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9260.339s">[Graham]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9262.28s">[Graham]</a>: So, so, in order to put forward a proposition two and a half override to the city, the mayor and the council need to agree to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9271.364s">[Graham]</a>: I sit on the city's finance task force and I know that that is very much part of the discussion happening right now so I believe that we will see a request from both the council and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9282.029s">[Graham]</a>: to do a proposition two and a half override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9284.831s">[Graham]</a>: There is, there are still a lot of questions to be sort of asked and answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9289.634s">[Graham]</a>: We've never even tried this in Medford before in history, we are one of like three communities in the entire state that hasn't even tried so we have a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9299.341s">[Graham]</a>: We're trying to collect answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9301.082s">[Graham]</a>: And those answers might include or could include if we do a proposition two and a half override, and it passes how quickly can that money flow to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9311.307s">[Graham]</a>: That is going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9312.347s">[Graham]</a>: And that's why I say we have to let the mayor and the council do their work, because they have a lot of questions to ask and answer to figure out like what is that path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9322.952s">[Graham]</a>: There's all kinds of other stuff that goes on in budgeting that the mayor is still working on as she puts her budget out so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9328.955s">[Graham]</a>: She may find that, you know, for example, local receipts from local receipts were higher than expected and so the revenue forecast can change so there's a lot of variables still happening but I think to answer your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9341.605s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, a proposition to have override is very much on the table and that would allow us and the first time in history to ask the community to tell us how much they value our schools and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9354.465s">[Graham]</a>: I've said it a million times I've campaigned three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9357.147s">[Graham]</a>: I'm a supporter, I will knock on your door and I will convince you when we get there but yeah it's a good question and I think that's where what we're going to do tonight is we're going to make a request so that everybody in the city knows what we need to help Medford thrive, not survive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9374.295s">[Graham]</a>: What Jerry has presented is like that sort of middle of the road response that includes both like what do we want to thrive, and then what do we think we might actually have at our disposal and how do we sort of close that gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9389.867s">[Graham]</a>: If that number that comes back from the city is something less than what we have asked for, then this committee will have to make the choices about what is funded and what is not so, but to answer your question, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9403.452s">[Graham]</a>: Raising revenue is one way that you balance the scales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9408.534s">[Graham]</a>: So, you're right on target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9411.116s">[Graham]</a>: It's just not something this group has the authority to do or I would do it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9573.72s">[Graham]</a>: Jerry, can I just also say from the chair that when you look at the depreciation life cycle of laptops that are frankly like more powerful and sophisticated than a Chromebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9585.105s">[Graham]</a>: The typical depreciation life cycle is like two or three years in any corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9590.187s">[Graham]</a>: So when we talk about a five year life cycle we're actually talking about a pretty extended life cycle for our equipment for our students so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9598.01s">[Graham]</a>: Luckily, Chromebooks have fewer moving parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9600.052s">[Graham]</a>: And so that's a little bit more feasible than in a laptop situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9604.575s">[Graham]</a>: But this depreciation cycle is very long already in today's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9753.584s">[Graham]</a>: Darren did you have more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10034.29s">[Graham]</a>: You can describe it right now if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10041.692s">[Graham]</a>: Can you put your microphone on so we can hear you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10338.096s">[Graham]</a>: Darren, did you want to tell us about your petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10608.288s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Darren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10608.889s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Noah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10609.549s">[Graham]</a>: There's many, many pages of signatures here, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10613.113s">[Graham]</a>: And I think, you know, sorry, I'm gonna maybe step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10618.459s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, is it, can you turn your mic off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10620.801s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think that's causing the feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10623.666s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I think that's better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10625.167s">[Graham]</a>: I'll stand back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10629.008s">[Graham]</a>: I know that this has been particularly hard on students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10632.41s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you all for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10634.231s">[Graham]</a>: I long for a day where our students can just be kids, and they don't have to worry about budget cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10641.835s">[Graham]</a>: And we're not there yet, obviously, judging by how many students are in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10647.581s">[Graham]</a>: But you're, you've all been heard, you've all been heard by all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10651.866s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think there's a single person in this room that wants to make the kinds of cuts that we are talking about having to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10658.193s">[Graham]</a>: And we will get to a vote that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10661.056s">[Graham]</a>: sort of solidifies that in just a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10663.177s">[Graham]</a>: But before we do that, I do want to hear from the community if there are folks who would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10670.321s">[Graham]</a>: So as a reminder, three minutes, please be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10674.002s">[Graham]</a>: And if you come to, oh, sorry, member of the potty, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11046.636s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11364.465s">[Graham]</a>: But I think the point is they're still employed at Memphis Public Schools through the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11368.606s">[Graham]</a>: So that work would have to happen in the right now in order to be ready for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12363.624s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to ask the superintendent to answer your question once we get through some of this public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12368.826s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12389.255s">[Graham]</a>: I mean, most people aren't giving it anyway, or it can't be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12392.137s">[Graham]</a>: So I think we're okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12393.178s">[Graham]</a>: If you just want to tell us your name, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12502.781s">[Graham]</a>: Is there somebody else who would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15543.953s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to remind you that you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15549.174s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, that's still a lot of people that need to speak and I just want to be respectful of everyone's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=17910.44s">[Graham]</a>: Watch, but I just wanted to remind you that you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18509.695s">[Graham]</a>: Could you please put the spreadsheet back up on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18514.139s">[Graham]</a>: And so could you please repeat your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18646.212s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sorry six in the affirmative, one abstention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18649.513s">[Graham]</a>: I requested the municipal government is a level service budget, which also includes for literacy interventionist for parabehavior specialists for a grand total of $79,399,774 motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18677.03s">[Graham]</a>: And we're going to move on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18679.3s">[Graham]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18681.449s">[Graham]</a>: 11 past 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18683.71s">[Graham]</a>: We don't have any presentations of the public tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18685.95s">[Graham]</a>: Item number, I can't count the number of emails anymore, seven, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18693.012s">[Graham]</a>: Continued businesses and MSBA update, and is there a motion to table that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18697.734s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18698.994s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to table by member Rousseau, seconded by member Lopate, and everybody, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18704.155s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18704.256s">[Graham]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18704.876s">[Graham]</a>: Good afternoon, thank you for taking the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18724.743s">[Graham]</a>: It was in the consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18726.165s">[Graham]</a>: We motioned to approve the consent agenda and it was unanimously approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18730.148s">[Graham]</a>: So we're all set there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18733.669s">[Graham]</a>: There is no new business and no reports requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18736.21s">[Graham]</a>: We do have a number of condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18739.652s">[Graham]</a>: Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Danny DiGiacomo, Jr., father of Denise Greco, McGlynn paraprofessional and afterschool program assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18770.877s">[Graham]</a>: If we could all rise for a moment of silence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18787.924s">[Graham]</a>: Our next regular meeting is on June 3 2024 here in Alden Memorial Chambers Medford City Hall in addition to zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18794.986s">[Graham]</a>: I hope you all join us again soon for happier times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18799.707s">[Graham]</a>: And I want to say a special thank you to all the students that we celebrated at the beginning of tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18806.89s">[Graham]</a>: I was really worried about asking people to come to this meeting to be celebrated because it wasn't going to be a fun meeting but honestly it was what I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18815.692s">[Graham]</a>: to make it to 10pm so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=127.895s">[Graham]</a>: Hi, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=189.858s">[Graham]</a>: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will devise a process to ensure regular annual maintenance of the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=194.881s">[Graham]</a>: Be it also resolved that the subcommittee will provide a report to the full school committee no later than June 10th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=200.305s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll call the roll, member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=206.008s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=206.668s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=207.269s">[Graham]</a>: And Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=208.269s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=208.729s">[Graham]</a>: So three presents are absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=211.85s">[Graham]</a>: Here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=212.231s">[Graham]</a>: So you can have that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=214.372s">[Graham]</a>: So I think actually what might make sense is for us to talk about the process first in terms of like how to ensure that we are doing that we are sort of getting back, I'll say getting back to post-COVID<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=232.832s">[Graham]</a>: a more routine and I'll say rigorous process around capital planning to try to anticipate, try to have like an ongoing roadmap that anticipates what those big needs are so that we can be communicating with our partners in city government what those upcoming needs are, what we think that they might be, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=253.921s">[Graham]</a>: And those things for which we would be wanting or needing capital funding to be able to complete the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=261.864s">[Graham]</a>: So before COVID, there was a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=267.986s">[Graham]</a>: It has changed over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=269.466s">[Graham]</a>: So there was a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=272.878s">[Graham]</a>: back right before COVID, I guess I would say maybe in the preceding year where like a sort of a four year chart that looks like this was produced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=281.965s">[Graham]</a>: And it listed each of the buildings and what on a year by year basis was on the capital like roadmap for that building and sort of estimates of what was being accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=295.497s">[Graham]</a>: And then during COVID,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=299.399s">[Graham]</a>: Our process actually sort of got absorbed into the city of Medford's capital improvement plan, which is this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=309.161s">[Graham]</a>: And there's a number of things from a school perspective in this, in this document as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=316.343s">[Graham]</a>: I'm just trying to find the page that talks about some of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=324.865s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=330.63s">[Graham]</a>: And let's see, we have this report outlined 27 projects for the schools at a cost of 12.4% of the total costs outlined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=355.542s">[Graham]</a>: total anticipated cost of $60 million and a percentage of total costs being 35%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=363.023s">[Graham]</a>: So, and there's a whole lot of information about what those 27 projects are that were outlined at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=370.805s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the time is, I think the time is right for us as a school committee to sort of take back the ownership of tracking all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=380.727s">[Graham]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=382.403s">[Graham]</a>: That is true, especially because we now have a electronic ticketing system for all of our like maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=391.936s">[Graham]</a>: projects and requests across the district right so work orders can be put into like a formal tracking system that I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=399.659s">[Graham]</a>: can maybe help us sort of make light work of what these capital requests are so that we can then put them on the roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=407.209s">[Graham]</a>: So, Dr. Cushing, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about how that system is working versus like what we used to do, which was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=415.2s">[Graham]</a>: ticketing system of sorts, you know, but via email and much harder to sort of report and track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=420.745s">[Graham]</a>: So what kind of capabilities do we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=557.829s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=560.87s">[Graham]</a>: Okay so then would it make sense for us to identify the things that are on this plan that maybe still aren't done and need to be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=568.695s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=570.232s">[Graham]</a>: and push them into the system, as well as to go, maybe ask you to go through the list of 27 projects in the city's capital plan and push those in so that we can generate a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=583.598s">[Graham]</a>: And then, you know, perhaps what we, so that's like startup, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=590.2s">[Graham]</a>: So we can get everything sort of pushed into the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=593.462s">[Graham]</a>: And then I'm wondering if on an annual basis, we set some sort of like timeline or schedule around like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=599.304s">[Graham]</a>: when will we have an annual capital planning discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=605.626s">[Graham]</a>: So that this committee sort of has that clear marching order, maybe we do it later in the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=610.528s">[Graham]</a>: So it's not such a like, sort of working session, but more of a presentation of what those things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=617.49s">[Graham]</a>: So the community sort of can understand what those things, what those what those plans are and when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=622.931s">[Graham]</a>: And I think my suggestion would be that that happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=628.755s">[Graham]</a>: Not in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=635.558s">[Graham]</a>: But I actually am almost wondering if we set this up to be like a November, December activity so that before the halfway point of the year and long before budget and long before free cash certifies, like we are proactively being able to like say and report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=657.829s">[Graham]</a>: Um, what, you know, what we believe that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=660.671s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=789.692s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=792.693s">[Graham]</a>: Buildings and grounds has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=795.054s">[Graham]</a>: historically like done many different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=799.296s">[Graham]</a>: But in its like last iterations, they were focused more on like, community driven, like beautification efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=811.402s">[Graham]</a>: And like, the more like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=813.888s">[Graham]</a>: tactical day-to-day stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=816.169s">[Graham]</a>: So, and that may still be the right thing for them versus, I'm almost thinking like this committee will get together to sort of craft what ultimately according to our policy really should be happening at a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=830.374s">[Graham]</a>: So if we think about like doing our work in October to collect, to make sure that like we have, you know, we have a report out of the ticketing system, we can sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=842.244s">[Graham]</a>: I think it would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=843.425s">[Graham]</a>: If we could craft what we think is like the right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=846.207s">[Graham]</a>: Prioritization and then bring it to a committee, the whole, to present that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=851.192s">[Graham]</a>: To the entire committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=852.172s">[Graham]</a>: So we have the entire committee's involvement in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=854.114s">[Graham]</a>: That might make some sense in terms of like a flow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=857.757s">[Graham]</a>: And then certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=860.119s">[Graham]</a>: Because the whole committee's there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1090.223s">[Graham]</a>: So two things sort of come to mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1092.984s">[Graham]</a>: I had a conversation with Alicia Hunt last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1097.319s">[Graham]</a>: And we were talking about this process of recommissioning buildings, which essentially looks at everything and says, here's how you restore this building to its original purpose and function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1112.845s">[Graham]</a>: And this is what you have to do in order to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1115.346s">[Graham]</a>: And eventually, the idea is we should do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1121.088s">[Graham]</a>: one building at a time in rotation over a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1124.631s">[Graham]</a>: And then no building is ever more than like six or seven years out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1128.773s">[Graham]</a>: And that's enough to like have that sort of big picture point of view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1135.718s">[Graham]</a>: The city has indicated a willingness to do that across this, for all of our outbuildings, not this building, not Curtis Tufts, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1147.086s">[Graham]</a>: Alicia would, her opinion is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1151.092s">[Graham]</a>: the OPM that they're bringing on to do the Andrews McGlynn project, they are the right people to help us do this too because of their deep familiarity with the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1163.52s">[Graham]</a>: And so she was definitely like sort of favorable to working with them to help facilitate that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1170.424s">[Graham]</a>: But to her point, like when you recommission a building, what you get out of it is a list of like problems to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1180.81s">[Graham]</a>: It's the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1181.71s">[Graham]</a>: It's the beginning of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1183.812s">[Graham]</a>: It's basically the creation of your to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1186.013s">[Graham]</a>: But all of those things should feed either work orders for the maintenance team to do because they have capacity to do X or Y or Z, or something that has to go on the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1199.321s">[Graham]</a>: So really, the output of the recommissioning study should go into the ticketing system so that we have one place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1206.445s">[Graham]</a>: for all of this to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1208.206s">[Graham]</a>: So I think Alicia can be a real ally in that and she's indicated a willingness to attend meetings provided that we can like say hey this is the meeting I want you to attend because she's got a lot on her plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1236.385s">[Graham]</a>: something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1281.156s">[Graham]</a>: Is that HMFA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1281.997s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1282.077s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1282.297s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1285.68s">[Graham]</a>: And so they're sort of another potential that could be part, you know, be part of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1307.029s">[Graham]</a>: No, probably not, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1309.11s">[Graham]</a>: And it could be that BTQ, I think that's their name,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1314.793s">[Graham]</a>: Does the OPM work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1318.376s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1318.836s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1320.178s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1322.099s">[Graham]</a>: I thought she was talking about B2Q to actually execute the recommissioning study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1327.844s">[Graham]</a>: But anyway, we can find that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1329.225s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not overly concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1331.227s">[Graham]</a>: The other question I had is, timing-wise, if we were to say our process is from October 1st to October 15th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1340.575s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to push out a proactive email to the principals of the buildings to say, if there is something that belongs on our capital plan like speak now submit your tickets, so that we can we can catch all of those and categorize them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1354.233s">[Graham]</a>: And then between, you know, late October early know, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1358.755s">[Graham]</a>: Late October into November, maybe we'll give ourselves the month of November because it's November and you know, it's a short month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1365.921s">[Graham]</a>: We sort of meet and put together sort of a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1369.845s">[Graham]</a>: And then in December, one of our meetings becomes or part, you know, part of one of our meetings becomes a committee of the whole where we review that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1377.091s">[Graham]</a>: That timing all works in the lead up to like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1381.82s">[Graham]</a>: free cash being available if we are dependent on free cash for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1386.443s">[Graham]</a>: It also predates or precedes our budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1394.327s">[Graham]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1395.868s">[Graham]</a>: And presumably if there's a stabilization fund, you could like tap into that at any time, but also it's not like an endless pot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1402.952s">[Graham]</a>: So that prioritization is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1406.173s">[Graham]</a>: The one question I have is where does the CPC<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1411.91s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1413.591s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1415.613s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1417.354s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1418.415s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1419.756s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1420.577s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1421.838s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1422.698s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1423.699s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1424.52s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1425.601s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1431.784s">[Graham]</a>: I, I don't exactly know like when are their applications do I would just want us to a rolling to like I did too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1438.066s">[Graham]</a>: I think there are certain things that are rolling, but I, but I thought there were like rounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1442.867s">[Graham]</a>: So I would just want to make sure like wherever that fits like It all fits into this process because I would hate for us to be like, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1449.97s">[Graham]</a>: And we could get CPC funding and like, oh, we just missed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1452.951s">[Graham]</a>: You know, I don't want us to like set Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1455.211s">[Graham]</a>: Why a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1696.851s">[Graham]</a>: So I have found two other presentations beyond the 27 projects that are listed here, so in the city's plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1708.983s">[Graham]</a>: And so I just wanted to run through because they're old, but I don't think that necessarily means they're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1715.567s">[Graham]</a>: that they're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1716.827s">[Graham]</a>: So this list has, it's mostly lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1720.889s">[Graham]</a>: So Peter, I think that's a question in terms of cafeteria and exterior lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1781.314s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so I just want to finish going through this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1783.195s">[Graham]</a>: So the Roberts School exterior lighting, are there exterior lighting needs that have not been addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1790.36s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1791.12s">[Graham]</a>: And then Missittuck has not yet been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1793.602s">[Graham]</a>: Brooks has not yet been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1795.783s">[Graham]</a>: Curtis Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1798.985s">[Graham]</a>: Whole building LED.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1806.23s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1808.075s">[Graham]</a>: So if you can check on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1809.576s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1811.216s">[Graham]</a>: Automotive shop LED?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1817.259s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1818.219s">[Graham]</a>: Andrews, halls and stairwells?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1821.701s">[Graham]</a>: And whole building LED?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1856.557s">[Graham]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1856.977s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1857.097s">[Graham]</a>: So you can check on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1859.258s">[Graham]</a>: Also on the Andrews School, and this list, by the way, this list is from like 2017, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1862.54s">[Graham]</a>: So I just want to make sure there's stuff that's still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1865.941s">[Graham]</a>: We're taking it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1868.082s">[Graham]</a>: Andrews School, it says controls upgrade for ADR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1871.483s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't even actually know what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1898.861s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1903.164s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, that's not us, that's public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1905.285s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1908.07s">[Graham]</a>: You'll find it funny to know that they said the Andrews HVAC upgrades were going to cost $25,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1963.095s">[Graham]</a>: OK, so then the second plan, just to bring us to current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1969.398s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, draft number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1972.3s">[Graham]</a>: Two air compressors at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1975.27s">[Graham]</a>: five air compressors at Missittuck, two air compressors at Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1979.174s">[Graham]</a>: They all were replaced, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1990.744s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1992.846s">[Graham]</a>: Andrew's new roof, that actually got done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2028.357s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2030.138s">[Graham]</a>: McGlynn Complex had auditorium seating work for $25,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2055.431s">[Graham]</a>: And then at the high school replace or replace repair fire alarm sealing system in 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2079.392s">[Graham]</a>: OK, so and then we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2083.814s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to put security improvements to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2085.874s">[Graham]</a>: I know that's an ongoing conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2087.415s">[Graham]</a>: The Andrews outside curb repairs, those curbs are still not installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2092.456s">[Graham]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2099.977s">[Graham]</a>: And then there is an item here for the McGlynn complex, asphalt and tire complex, including Andrews side curb repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2109.697s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so all of that is still like in progress, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2112.779s">[Graham]</a>: That's not complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2145.364s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so I'm not going to worry about some of the later things for high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2152.348s">[Graham]</a>: McGlynn complex, roof rebuild, air compressors, and chiller contact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2158.544s">[Graham]</a>: contact compressor, all of that is being handled with this HVAC project that will go in for the system to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2185.852s">[Graham]</a>: So we would have some sort of roof assessment, which I think we can sort of let recommissioning guide priority there, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2199.942s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that's on here looks like water heaters at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2323.581s">[Graham]</a>: So we said CPC applications are like July?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2327.022s">[Graham]</a>: Opens in July, due in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2328.563s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2343.907s">[Graham]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2344.347s">[Graham]</a>: I think they were the $120,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2345.688s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2348.228s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think they were the $120,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2349.389s">[Graham]</a>: They were huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2350.449s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, they were not inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2353.638s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2355.019s">[Graham]</a>: And that was, you know, many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2356.459s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2357.18s">[Graham]</a>: So then I think it was, sorry, the surfacing at Roberts was 109, 540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2374.987s">[Graham]</a>: Um, okay, so I think from a sort of process and cadence perspective and Jerry like, please weigh in what we talked about was like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2385.929s">[Graham]</a>: a desire to use the ticketing system, sort of push all of the things into it so that it can come, it can be tracked there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2393.094s">[Graham]</a>: And then at the beginning of October, we would send out a reminder to principals that like, we're gonna do our, we're gonna start our capital planning process for the annual year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2403.94s">[Graham]</a>: And so if they have anything else, they need to like get those things into the system so we can be considering them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2409.544s">[Graham]</a>: And then in October and November, this committee will meet to like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2413.948s">[Graham]</a>: lisa smith, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2437.759s">[Graham]</a>: I think we should invite Alicia to our like our subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2456.255s">[Graham]</a>: especially because I think that is more likely to be happening in her work day, which might be easier for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2463.098s">[Graham]</a>: And then certainly she wants to come to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2465.379s">[Graham]</a>: So that's sort of what we're talking about in terms of sort of revising our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2470.141s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2486.689s">[Graham]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2498.515s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2500.156s">[Graham]</a>: So I think the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2502.444s">[Graham]</a>: is that we probably can present the process to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2509.349s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to write it up after we meet so that everybody knows what to expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2514.892s">[Graham]</a>: That is actually something that we do need to do in one of our upcoming meetings in June, because that's what we said we would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2521.797s">[Graham]</a>: And I think, Peter, I can pass these old items to you to put into operations hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2531.738s">[Graham]</a>: And then maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2534.301s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe we even like you tell us when you're ready to meet with like sort of everything that you can see pushed in and we can look at what that reporting looks like and tweak it even in advance of this next official cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2548.553s">[Graham]</a>: So I would be happy to like do that on Zoom over the summer at some point if there's a time that works for everybody, just so that it happens when things are not quite as chaotic as the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2564.092s">[Graham]</a>: Do you need that investigated before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2566.413s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we need to investigate it before we tell the committee what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2571.435s">[Graham]</a>: But I think before we meet in the summer, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2575.977s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2576.937s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2604.229s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we necessarily need to, if.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2608.351s">[Graham]</a>: If you're willing to take a crack at writing the policy on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2923.88s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2926.881s">[Graham]</a>: So it sounds like maybe we just need to make a motion to present our policy and process to the school committee and that member Rousseau is going to draft on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2939.568s">[Graham]</a>: I'll make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2941.349s">[Graham]</a>: Motion by Member White.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2943.271s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2944.071s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded by Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2946.933s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, we're in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2949.795s">[Graham]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2950.515s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2951.076s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2951.556s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2952.337s">[Graham]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2954.318s">[Graham]</a>: Only three of us, so we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2955.739s">[Graham]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3058.974s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3059.635s">[Graham]</a>: I did see that she did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3061.496s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3062.176s">[Graham]</a>: But, um, yeah, and I actually got to join the playground last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3066.318s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and it was awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=14.327s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and read the meeting notice so we can get started and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=22.227s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully it will not take us the entire time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=24.948s">[Graham]</a>: So we will see what we see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=29.25s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so please be advised that on Wednesday, May 29th at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=36.053s">[Graham]</a>: there'll be a strategic and capital planning meeting, sorry, finance subcommittee meeting of the Medford High School Comprehensive School Building Committee held through remote participation via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=48.298s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is being recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=50.779s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel, through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast channel 9, 8, or 22, and Verizon channel 44, 45, or 47.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=64.128s">[Graham]</a>: Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can call or log in by using the following meeting number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=69.012s">[Graham]</a>: It's 963-3633-4995.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=74.035s">[Graham]</a>: Questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing jennigraham at medford.k12.ma.us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=80.319s">[Graham]</a>: Those submitting must include the following information, your first name and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=89.262s">[Graham]</a>: So I will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=92.223s">[Graham]</a>: Let's see, where did it go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=94.403s">[Graham]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=101.906s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham here, Mayor Lungo Kern, do not see her yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=107.387s">[Graham]</a>: Libby Brown?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=108.088s">[Graham]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=142.304s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, you're on mute, but I think you said yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=148.571s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so for attendance purposes, we have three present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=155.938s">[Graham]</a>: So the meeting can be called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=159.822s">[Graham]</a>: We also thank you, Alicia, for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=164.792s">[Graham]</a>: I invited Alicia, who's our head of everything, it seems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=171.555s">[Graham]</a>: Development and sustainability and something else, right, Alicia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=180.64s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=181.16s">[Graham]</a>: I knew I was forgetting something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=183.341s">[Graham]</a>: Because a lot of the things that we'll be talking about certainly have some crossover into Alicia's world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=190.559s">[Graham]</a>: And so thank you for being here and for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=195.201s">[Graham]</a>: We have just two items on our agenda for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=198.582s">[Graham]</a>: And certainly if people have questions along the way, it's a small group and you can feel free to stop me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=206.926s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm happy to field those questions as best I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=210.347s">[Graham]</a>: We have two agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=211.287s">[Graham]</a>: So one was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=213.388s">[Graham]</a>: to start a discussion about potential sites for Medford High School that would inform our next steps in the process, which ultimately is getting towards a feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=225.499s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other thing that we have on our agenda is to discuss the anticipated budget for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=233.166s">[Graham]</a>: And if the mayor's not here, we may just table that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=236.428s">[Graham]</a>: But when we talk about potential sites,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=240.592s">[Graham]</a>: there I think there have been some questions raised in the community certainly over over the period of years around how to think about a new Medford High School and where it might be and I think you know certainly where it is right now is one very viable option but I think there is like a sort of a broader sense of possibility potentially in terms of what we might be thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=268.067s">[Graham]</a>: And we don't need to make any decisions tonight, but I wanted to start the conversation because if there is a broadening of what needs to be studied in the feasibility study, we'll need to know that in order to start to sort of weave that into our process and our application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=283.239s">[Graham]</a>: So that's our first agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=288.063s">[Graham]</a>: And I am happy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=290.909s">[Graham]</a>: take any comments that you all have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=292.43s">[Graham]</a>: So, you know, Fiona and Bob, you may not have as much to say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=297.692s">[Graham]</a>: That's totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=299.833s">[Graham]</a>: But just trying to start to think through, you know, as a group, where do we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=306.752s">[Graham]</a>: you know, where do we begin in terms of sort of what is possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=314.275s">[Graham]</a>: And so, Alicia, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=315.995s">[Graham]</a>: That's certainly a very helpful person to have on the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=320.797s">[Graham]</a>: So I will stop talking and see if there's any questions, comments, thoughts, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=326.099s">[Graham]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=364.093s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think that is certainly possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=366.416s">[Graham]</a>: I have, I have certainly heard people talk about Placedead Park as a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=371.641s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=374.144s">[Graham]</a>: And I guess if you're going to talk about Placedead you could talk about potentially any of those like sort of open green spaces which all are under city control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=384.972s">[Graham]</a>: Not that I want to sort of be the committee that takes parks away, takes parks out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=389.375s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not saying that, I promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=390.536s">[Graham]</a>: It will be a swamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=392.657s">[Graham]</a>: But that, you know, I know that that at least sounds like it has been a discussion over the course of years in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=402.664s">[Graham]</a>: And certainly, you know, as people speculate about what this project could be, that comes up fairly often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=408.868s">[Graham]</a>: And I think it comes up often because at some point in time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=413.868s">[Graham]</a>: There was a discussion about if there was going to be a new high school, could it be somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=417.414s">[Graham]</a>: And somehow that seems to have been the thing that sort of stuck in the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=422.295s">[Graham]</a>: public purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=450.409s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=452.51s">[Graham]</a>: I do hear, I hear a lot of people talk about how it is not central in the city and it is not particularly easy to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=462.961s">[Graham]</a>: I can sort of speak to like our busing situation so currently we provide buses<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=472.952s">[Graham]</a>: at for those students who are more than two miles outside of the school zone in the secondary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=480.658s">[Graham]</a>: So that includes middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=483.261s">[Graham]</a>: The way we do that at the high school is in part through MBTA buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=488.385s">[Graham]</a>: And then there is some yellow bus service to North Medford where there is no MBTA service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=494.389s">[Graham]</a>: So certainly central location is something that's been discussed a whole bunch of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=501.895s">[Graham]</a>: you know, over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=503.076s">[Graham]</a>: So that certainly is a factor when we think about the high school and the, you know, the sheer amount of traffic that has to get to and from every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1456.806s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, you would be talking about two building projects, not one at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1462.088s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1465.211s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1481.623s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1483.624s">[Graham]</a>: Can you share or do I need to let you share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1488.508s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1488.728s">[Graham]</a>: I'll try that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1543.638s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think there's a couple of variables there, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1546.98s">[Graham]</a>: One is that the school committee has voted that they want to see Curtis Tufts come onto the site of the high school in some sort of co-location perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1561.186s">[Graham]</a>: So that's one thing that, and obviously that's like 20 kids, so it's not like substantive in terms of the number of students, but the space needs are very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1571.411s">[Graham]</a>: And the other thing that is part of this grant is our early childhood programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1576.715s">[Graham]</a>: So there is a possibility of changing the amount of early childhood programming happening on the property in a way that would expand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1589.785s">[Graham]</a>: So the other thing that I think is like sort of dicey is like once you throw in the vocational programming,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1598.161s">[Graham]</a>: The space conversation is completely different than the space conversation about a new high school, but MSBA, you're correct, will go through and they will size the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1610.587s">[Graham]</a>: They will size the enrollment, and then I believe the feasibility study will size the building based on that enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1670.734s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think that's definitely something that we'll consider because edgily is, I mean, you can even see it in the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1678.247s">[Graham]</a>: You can see more rubber in the picture than grass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1686.37s">[Graham]</a>: So yeah, so we will, you know, have to contend with that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1689.013s">[Graham]</a>: But I, you know, I think some of that all of that can be studied, you know, anything about like the current, the current space can certainly be will certainly be part of the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1698.082s">[Graham]</a>: It's really just a question of like, you know, where are those other possibilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1702.467s">[Graham]</a>: So in doing this, are there any, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1792.164s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1792.684s">[Graham]</a>: Well, and COLO, moving things around during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1797.455s">[Graham]</a>: construction becomes really tricky with our vocational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1801.116s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that will be part of the feasibility study as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1804.057s">[Graham]</a>: But just to say like, you know, it's not the same as like moving a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1812.779s">[Graham]</a>: It's an entirely different sort of undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1815.26s">[Graham]</a>: So that's something that we'll have to consider as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1817.04s">[Graham]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1820.241s">[Graham]</a>: So Alicia, are there any other spaces that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1824.349s">[Graham]</a>: come to your mind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1825.589s">[Graham]</a>: I think this is a perfectly fine working list, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1828.731s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1988.329s">[Graham]</a>: But that's State Road, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1990.25s">[Graham]</a>: It is a State Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2053.627s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2080.947s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, yeah, they pack them in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2085.066s">[Graham]</a>: Alicia, thank you for all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2086.407s">[Graham]</a>: I think this was really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2089.589s">[Graham]</a>: I have to, I just got access to the MSBA's portal that requires us to submit a bunch of information that feeds enrollment projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2100.757s">[Graham]</a>: And so, Bob and Alicia, there's definitely some tentacles there that will require your input around, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2109.301s">[Graham]</a>: growth, planned growth, and that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2114.524s">[Graham]</a>: So I will sort of funnel that off to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2116.805s">[Graham]</a>: I've just started looking at it though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2118.926s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure, I don't think there's anywhere where we have to sort of describe this just yet, but perhaps it has to be described in the RFP when we are at the point of like going out either to the OPM or out to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2137.734s">[Graham]</a>: the actual feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2139.155s">[Graham]</a>: So hard to say like exactly when this information will be useful, but I think it's sort of on the minds of lots of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2144.86s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm glad that we had the conversation because now I can assure people that we are talking broadly about all the possibilities and really thinking through all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2155.269s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I think that was, uh, that was very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2157.971s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2158.791s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the other item on our agenda for tonight is to start to talk about, um, the anticipated budget for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2167.176s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, and, you know, I can talk a little bit about next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2170.819s">[Graham]</a>: So before, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2174.065s">[Graham]</a>: before we can get out of the eligibility phase, we have to, the city has to authorize a feasibility, the cost of a feasibility study and demonstrates MSBA that we have the money, whatever that mechanism is, and, you know, an amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2192.189s">[Graham]</a>: So that, I know I have been talking to the mayor about that and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2199.577s">[Graham]</a>: I believe her plan is to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2205.022s">[Graham]</a>: At least that's where she was at the last time I spoke with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2210.606s">[Graham]</a>: And so we won't need to take a vote to do a bond or a debt exclusion, but the council will have to take some sort of vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2219.286s">[Graham]</a>: that authorizes its use and it needs to be in a pile that is demonstrable for the MSBA in order for them to sort of flag us into the next phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2228.194s">[Graham]</a>: So procedurally, that's what needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2230.637s">[Graham]</a>: As I've been talking to people about sort of what the budget needs to be, I've heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2238.484s">[Graham]</a>: you know, a variety of numbers between two and a quarter and $3 million for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2245.325s">[Graham]</a>: Roughly half of that, a little bit more than half, it sounds like, would come back to us eventually in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2252.327s">[Graham]</a>: If we get all the way through with MSBA, they do credit you back the same thing as your reimbursement rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2258.108s">[Graham]</a>: And when we had our kickoff call with them, I think they said our reimbursement rate was like 52.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2262.609s">[Graham]</a>: seven or 52.69 as of that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2265.812s">[Graham]</a>: So it changes, apparently it can change all the time, but 52% of that would come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2271.744s">[Graham]</a>: eventually, but not, but the city has to put the money up front to do the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2277.429s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that was raised to my attention was that, and actually we took a tour of Arlington High School and they're in the middle of their project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2287.819s">[Graham]</a>: So part of the building is open, part of it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2290.361s">[Graham]</a>: And they said something sort of related, which was, we're still learning how to use this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2296.987s">[Graham]</a>: and there's all kinds of things that happen in the building where they're like oh there's something wrong with the building and it just turns out like they don't know how to use the building like the entire infrastructure of the building is different than what they're used to and so they're very much in this like learning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2312.591s">[Graham]</a>: So our CFO at the schools said that it's not uncommon for districts to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2318.533s">[Graham]</a>: In addition to bringing on the OPM and ultimately the designer to bring somebody on on the district side to ride sort of side saddle with the project and really intimately understand all of the various components<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2337.451s">[Graham]</a>: of the build and how it works and how it's envisioned to work and how the plan changed to the actual and all of that from a facilities maintenance perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2347.56s">[Graham]</a>: And that that's a job that's sort of bigger than like the director of facilities just being able to do that in addition to all the other things that he does already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2357.848s">[Graham]</a>: And that Jerry was saying that the other thing we might consider is, and I need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2363.733s">[Graham]</a>: connect back with him on this, but the other thing we might consider is making sure that that set aside funded this like this position that sort of helps us like sort of smooth that out and bridge the gap over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2378.118s">[Graham]</a>: So that's sort of another thing that we need to think about in terms of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2384.047s">[Graham]</a>: So I, you know, by all the accounts that I've heard somewhere between two and a half and three is probably the right amount of money based on all the things that have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2394.696s">[Graham]</a>: But Bob and Fiona, I wasn't sure whether you had resources that you could tap into in terms of other procurements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2405.305s">[Graham]</a>: and the budgets being set for communities like ours for this for these processes that might help inform that that ultimate number that needs to be set aside and I don't know what sort of digging and investigating you all have done in your free time on this up till now and I don't know you know sort of how you are connected to other communities but I wanted to give you some space to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2430.607s">[Graham]</a>: talk to us about what those, where you might have information that could plug into that, or even Alicia, if you have those connections, like how can we sort of leverage the city side and talk about all of that as well, sort of actively?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2552.949s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think that Nantucket is a very different place for all those reasons you cite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2558.99s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know, Fiona, if you are connected to other purchasing folks that might have some light to shed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2566.071s">[Graham]</a>: And Libby, I know you sort of work in this space, if you have any light to shed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2571.012s">[Graham]</a>: So it's really just more to sort of get the juices flowing and thinking about before we go too far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2638.25s">[Graham]</a>: If you could, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2639.77s">[Graham]</a>: I think the other thing that would be helpful Fiona to start the wheels turning in, um, in a related way is to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2646.88s">[Graham]</a>: to find out if they have copies of their procurements for their owner's project manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2652.503s">[Graham]</a>: That's going to be our net, you know, that's going to be our like big thing is to like get ready to issue that RFP because once the OPM gets on board, life for all the rest of us gets easier, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2664.03s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm looking forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2666.732s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2667.632s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2668.673s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2698.324s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2698.744s">[Graham]</a>: And Fiona, I'm thinking that there's also, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2702.483s">[Graham]</a>: some very school-specific things about building with MSBA that maybe your counterparts in those other communities could provide as well, because the MSBA's process is very prescriptive, sort of at every step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2714.952s">[Graham]</a>: So anything that they can tell us, because my goal, you know, my goal, whenever we're done with eligibility and they invite us to the next phase, which is hiring our OPM, is like, my goal is that the next day our RP goes out the door and we are moving right along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2732.205s">[Graham]</a>: And so obviously we'll sort of convene a working group with you between now and then to sort of get that procurement ready to go and make sure that it has all of its moving parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2742.93s">[Graham]</a>: But if you're talking to them anyway, maybe grabbing that stuff too from them would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=2881.572s">[Graham]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3031.681s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and the school committee has already outlined that set of goals and objectives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3038.041s">[Graham]</a>: we're sort of on our way with that for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3040.384s">[Graham]</a>: But yes, like making sure that sort of what we envision is well outlined is definitely sort of top of mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3137.02s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and Alicia, the numbers I've been hearing are pretty consistent from multiple sources in terms of people familiar with Medford and this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3148.567s">[Graham]</a>: The numbers are not all over the map, so I think that's a good thing for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3154.11s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the mayor is hearing the same, so that is awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3164.956s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3167.441s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3169.202s">[Graham]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3170.743s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, ultimately, we will the city council have to take a vote with some very precise language, but I don't think that's anything for this group to be worried about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3179.387s">[Graham]</a>: I will like work with MSBA to make sure the language that goes forward is compliant and sort of ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3185.05s">[Graham]</a>: But, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3187.366s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think those were our two agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3191.17s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you all for joining, 655.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3193.933s">[Graham]</a>: We're done early, so hopefully you can take your hour back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3200.099s">[Graham]</a>: And then Bob and Alicia, I will reach out to you separately about some of the things that we need from a planning and projection perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3211.437s">[Graham]</a>: It may be more Alicia than Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3212.798s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3213.299s">[Graham]</a>: I've just literally got the access like two hours ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3216.061s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3255.856s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3256.856s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3259.42s">[Graham]</a>: So if there are no other questions, is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3270.183s">[Graham]</a>: Motion adjourned by Aaron, seconded by Libby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3276.465s">[Graham]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3277.745s">[Graham]</a>: And roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3281.286s">[Graham]</a>: Jenny Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3282.427s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor Longo Kern, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3284.267s">[Graham]</a>: Libby Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3285.347s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3286.728s">[Graham]</a>: And Aaron Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3289.649s">[Graham]</a>: Three in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3291.533s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3295.52s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6148.224s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6149.625s">[Graham]</a>: I'm actually going to hold most of my comments because Member Rousseau helpfully crafted a policy that covers much of what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6161.454s">[Graham]</a>: The only other thing that I would add is that we will be making updates to the existing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6169.597s">[Graham]</a>: capital plan for the schools in time for that next cycle next year, assuming that that passes tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6175.363s">[Graham]</a>: So we can get to that later, the process, which I think was the more substantive part of our conversation later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6183.932s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8021.01s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8022.875s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8024.175s">[Graham]</a>: I actually have had a chance to tour the playground, and it's super exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8029.176s">[Graham]</a>: I was involved in the CPC applications that started this, actually, that happened before I was on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8037.818s">[Graham]</a>: And it started out as a collaboration between the PTOs at the three schools that got resurfacing at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8046.02s">[Graham]</a>: So it was the Missittuc, the Brooks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8048.824s">[Graham]</a>: and the McLean and the folks at the McLean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8054.082s">[Graham]</a>: were very committed to making sure that what they did for that school served the school for the long haul and not in the just the immediate, like, I want the same as everybody else kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8067.191s">[Graham]</a>: So I want to just say thank you to them for their patience, because this has been a long process, much to all of our, you know, chagrin, like we all could have done without COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8078.339s">[Graham]</a>: But here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8080.802s">[Graham]</a>: And the project is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8082.483s">[Graham]</a>: And we're still accepting donations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8084.684s">[Graham]</a>: And maybe we can put another reminder in the weekly in the weekly update from the superintendent that that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8093.789s">[Graham]</a>: So we are still looking for community donations to support, you know, making sure that we can really sort of dress this proper place out the way that it deserves to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8105.682s">[Graham]</a>: There's so many trees going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8108.063s">[Graham]</a>: It's going to be the envy of every elementary school and the question is going to be which one is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8113.344s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm hopeful that we'll be able to find some money for those conversations quickly because this playground is far above anything that Medford Public Schools has ever been able to see or deliver to students before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8129.287s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8772.919s">[Graham]</a>: Just a few brief updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8775.88s">[Graham]</a>: There are five deliverables in the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8778.48s">[Graham]</a>: Two of the five have been submitted to MSBA already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8782.861s">[Graham]</a>: The remaining three are on track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8786.402s">[Graham]</a>: I am anticipating that in our meeting tomorrow night the chapter 74 eligibility form will be finalized and approved by the committee and they will do a first draft review of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8798.445s">[Graham]</a>: our educational profile where we will look at that before June is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8802.889s">[Graham]</a>: So we are sort of pushing hard to make sure that we are getting all of our deliverables in just as quickly as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8811.235s">[Graham]</a>: I'm working with the mayor and the president of the council to make sure that the right votes get taken to fund the feasibility study, which will rely on free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8821.103s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that also just to happen here in the month of June in some capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8827.628s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of some of the work the committee has been doing, we have established two subcommittees so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8834.894s">[Graham]</a>: One is about communications and community engagement, actually three subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8839.277s">[Graham]</a>: Communications and community engagement has built a plan that includes some surveying that we'll do in the short term to ask the community sort of what their questions are so that the website can attempt to answer some of those questions proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8854.982s">[Graham]</a>: We also have talked about a strategy of how to start to include the community in the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8861.106s">[Graham]</a>: It's a little bit of a boring conversation right now because it's a lot of paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8865.648s">[Graham]</a>: But once we sort of move into the next phases, we're actually talking about things like feasibility study and envisioning what a new building could look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8873.552s">[Graham]</a>: That'll be a sort of a completely different scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8877.294s">[Graham]</a>: So we have a plan that includes things like being at tables at community events and having a pitch deck for lack of a better term that we can use to go talk to all the boards and commissions who might be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8890.041s">[Graham]</a>: So we have some like upfront planning and survey work happening really over the course of the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8895.504s">[Graham]</a>: And then, you know, sort of really just using this time to set the stage for good proactive communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8903.735s">[Graham]</a>: We also had a rules and onboarding subcommittee meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8906.697s">[Graham]</a>: We have established and passed our operating rules, which are very similar to what they are here in terms of using Robert's Rules of Order and trying to take a more, actually a less formal tone than we do even here, but outlining the same rules of public participation that we use here so that we can make sure that our meetings can remain productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8930.591s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, overall, have established a path for what happens when we need to onboard new people so we have sort of plans in place for all of that so that somebody coming on board can get up to speed quickly if that becomes necessary which over the life of us five to seven year project it's inevitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8951.618s">[Graham]</a>: The website, the dedicated website is just about complete in its draft form and it will include bios of all the folks that are on the committee, it will include all of our minutes and all of our agendas and all the documents that we have talked about so far, submitted documents, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8972.733s">[Graham]</a>: And then just other helpful links, FAQs, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8975.195s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that is about done and ready to be launched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8978.9s">[Graham]</a>: But our anticipation is that there won't be a lot of traction for that until we get into the feasibility study phase, which is just a little ways down the road for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8991.63s">[Graham]</a>: Again, we have to be done by January 27.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8993.652s">[Graham]</a>: We're on track to be done far sooner than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8999.577s">[Graham]</a>: And the sooner that we're done, the sooner we can get in the queue to go to the board meeting, which happens every other month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9006.402s">[Graham]</a>: And then the sooner that we can move on to those next phases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9011.104s">[Graham]</a>: We also had a finance subcommittee meeting, where we talked with Alicia hunt who's our director of planning and sustain a development and sustainability is that right okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9024.738s">[Graham]</a>: And she was immensely helpful there's been a lot of questions around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9029.705s">[Graham]</a>: the site of the new high school and whether there are other possibilities besides where Medford High is right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9036.669s">[Graham]</a>: And she went through, she pulled up a map and went through what those options might be in terms of sort of things that she would be thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9047.315s">[Graham]</a>: We don't need that information just yet, but at some point we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9050.437s">[Graham]</a>: So, you know, for example, like people have asked about Playstead Park as a potential site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9057.061s">[Graham]</a>: I think that has been noted before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9059.341s">[Graham]</a>: She actually said that's sort of not on her hit parade of places to look, namely because we would be burying the high school further into a corner of the city that is the wealthiest corner of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9074.832s">[Graham]</a>: So we'd be sort of advantaging students already who generally have lots of advantage in terms of getting to the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9081.737s">[Graham]</a>: And then, you know, there's sort of a whole bunch of transportation concerns with that location as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9087.739s">[Graham]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): She did cite Tufts Park is maybe someplace to think about because even though it is also sort of in a corner of the city, which is its own HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Challenge from a transportation perspective, her thought was like it is in a corner of the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9102.349s">[Graham]</a>: would actually advantage students who are historically disadvantaged in terms of their ability to get back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9109.534s">[Graham]</a>: She also said that, you know, her planner heart says she would love to see Medford High back in the middle of the city, just like it used to be one day long ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9117.999s">[Graham]</a>: And so that's sort of also a conversation we talked about, like the complex over at Hormel, and sort of ruled that out for the most part, because it would be too congested with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9130.208s">[Graham]</a>: elementary, middle, and high school all sort of having to convene in the same place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9134.491s">[Graham]</a>: So we had a really, really good discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9136.713s">[Graham]</a>: We also talked with Fiona Maxwell, who's our purchasing official for the city, and she's certified and meets requirements by MSBA, and she is starting to work on collecting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9149.543s">[Graham]</a>: model documents for bringing on our owners project manager, which will be our next our next phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9156.047s">[Graham]</a>: And we talked about, again, an aggressive goal that on the day where they approve us to go into the owners project manager selection phase that our fee goes out the door that same day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9164.993s">[Graham]</a>: And so that's going to take some advanced work and planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9168.335s">[Graham]</a>: And so she is starting to talk to the local communities around us who have done this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9173.138s">[Graham]</a>: to start to pull some of those things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9174.839s">[Graham]</a>: So everybody's like really eager to get past this phase, which is exciting and has been helpful and collaborative all throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9188.403s">[Graham]</a>: So it is a big committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9189.683s">[Graham]</a>: Everything is going great so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9191.464s">[Graham]</a>: We've had great attendance and great participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9193.624s">[Graham]</a>: And there's just like a lot of sort of legwork to do between now and say the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9199.666s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll continue to sort of work through that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9201.887s">[Graham]</a>: We have a meeting tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9203.929s">[Graham]</a>: Our meetings are in the bistro so people are welcome to join us in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9207.592s">[Graham]</a>: They are on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9208.793s">[Graham]</a>: We've not seen a lot of traction yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9211.635s">[Graham]</a>: It is June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9214.497s">[Graham]</a>: There are a few million things happening at the same time so I'm not surprised but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9218.974s">[Graham]</a>: I also think the time for that participation is going to be once we get into the feasibility study where we're hiring a designer who's actually engaging with us to say, tell us, tell us what you want this place to look like and what you want it to be and what you want to be able to do in the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9234.212s">[Graham]</a>: much like what we talked about with McGlynn, like how do you really thoughtfully design like every last nook and cranny of a building so it both serves a need and provides some flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9243.398s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that's like sort of down the line and that's where really we'll be talking to, you know, to teachers, to staff, to students, to the community and all of that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9254.144s">[Graham]</a>: So all that's very much to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9256.526s">[Graham]</a>: So that's just a quick update of what we're doing, but we do have a pretty robust communication plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9263.806s">[Graham]</a>: getting underway, and everyone's excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9268.809s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10314.285s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10315.606s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10318.267s">[Graham]</a>: You know, one of the things that I feel like we have seen, and we see it happen in different ways every year, but certainly we're seeing it this year, is like, you know, we get to the point where we're like talking about the budget with the community, and all of a sudden, what we're asking for and what we think we're going to get all gets like mushed together and people get really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10342.04s">[Graham]</a>: What when I think about being led by a strategic plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10345.682s">[Graham]</a>: I think that means like somebody sitting down at some point in time and saying, in order to make progress strategically on whatever our objectives are like here's what we need to do next year and then you have to sort of let reality like play play its course and and you adjust from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10363.072s">[Graham]</a>: But we've not yet ever really gotten to a point where like that, what do we need to do the things that we're setting out to do is not muddied by some financial reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10375.848s">[Graham]</a>: And I think it's a disservice to the community because I think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10380.593s">[Graham]</a>: have questions about, are we doing strategic thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10384.195s">[Graham]</a>: Are we doing things that, you know, improve the arts programming across the district from, you know, K to 12?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10391.859s">[Graham]</a>: Like nobody sees that work because it gets sort of buried under everything that happens when you start talking about the reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10401.204s">[Graham]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10402.304s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10403.745s">[Graham]</a>: We've, we've sort of bifurcated these two things, but it's still very, it's so tight and close together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10409.269s">[Graham]</a>: It's still quite muddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10410.13s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and I would also say that we are unusual in that we are in June and still talking about a budget that does not happen across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10420.857s">[Graham]</a>: People are passing school committee budgets in January, and they're feeling like they're behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10425.68s">[Graham]</a>: Like there are communities that pass budgets before January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10428.802s">[Graham]</a>: Like none of this is unusual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10432.102s">[Graham]</a>: in terms of sort of endeavoring to have a better process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10435.664s">[Graham]</a>: And I feel like maybe those communities have figured out that like the gauntlet of May and June is just not the time to be also hashing out like the, whether you're gonna have enough paper next year, like all of the things that sort of converge in May and June, like we need to start to offload some of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10454.231s">[Graham]</a>: It's just like an unsustainable amount of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10458.971s">[Graham]</a>: activity that has to happen during that time, both for the superintendent, for all of Medford Public Schools, for this body, for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10466.532s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's a way for us to sort of be thoughtful and strategic and do our part and do so in a little bit more of a pathway when we can take advantage of what are historically like generally sort of light meetings in January and February and March to really hash out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10485.81s">[Graham]</a>: the strategic details and then we're sort of on our way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10488.733s">[Graham]</a>: So I like the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10490.615s">[Graham]</a>: I have been pushing to do things sooner earlier since I started on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10497.482s">[Graham]</a>: And we're not there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10498.683s">[Graham]</a>: Like and even here, here we are, it's June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10501.145s">[Graham]</a>: And I was like, it's earlier than ever before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10503.428s">[Graham]</a>: And it's here, it's still June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10505.249s">[Graham]</a>: We're still talking about this in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10507.592s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10508.834s">[Graham]</a>: people don't have clarity about like what exactly is happening and what that means and to some degree that will always be the case because we are dependent on the mayor putting out her budget, she has work to do to do that that has nothing to do with us, and the council has to agree to all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10524.892s">[Graham]</a>: There, there are still those things that are going to push us to having budget discussions in June, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10530.894s">[Graham]</a>: I just think we should have less of budget discussions in June and more budget discussions earlier in the cycle so that we are not part of like what the ultimate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10543.478s">[Graham]</a>: sort of June rush looks like, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10545.84s">[Graham]</a>: So I think we have an opportunity to try this and if it doesn't work, we can revisit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10551.925s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm in full support and would make a motion to approve it with that one amendment of talking about the municipal allocation instead of the proposed reconciled budget in phase five, item 1B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11134.966s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, Member Graham, and then we'll take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11138.047s">[Graham]</a>: Sure, I just wanted to revise my motion a little bit, and I think this might help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11142.529s">[Graham]</a>: So a motion to approve this on first reading with two amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11148.831s">[Graham]</a>: One is section five, item 1B, in that second line, it shouldn't say proposed reconciled budget, it should say proposed municipal allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11163.909s">[Graham]</a>: And then with a second amendment in phase two, item number two, it says principals and we're going to add and department heads discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=306.584s">[Graham]</a>: All right, so please be advised that on June 4, 2024, from 6 to 8, there'll be a meeting of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee held at Bistro 489, Medford Vocational Technical High School, 49 Winthrop Street and via remote participation for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=369.731s">[Graham]</a>: Marissa Desmond, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=372.754s">[Graham]</a>: Maria Dorsey, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=374.375s">[Graham]</a>: Brian Hilliard, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=375.937s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy Keene, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=377.438s">[Graham]</a>: Emily Lazaro, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=378.899s">[Graham]</a>: Nicole Morrell, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=380.281s">[Graham]</a>: Aaron Olopade, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=381.642s">[Graham]</a>: Luke Prisner, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=383.303s">[Graham]</a>: Larry Brown, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=385.168s">[Graham]</a>: Bob Dickinson, Fiona Maxwell, Joan Bowen, Tom Dalton, Chad Ballin, Lori Hodgson, John McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau, Phillip Santos, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=399.172s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so we have 14 present, one absent, and we're ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=409.897s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, the first item on the agenda is the consent agenda and approval of minutes for the 513 full committee meeting and the 529 finance subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=420.345s">[Graham]</a>: There are two corrections that need to be made to member Morrell's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=426.73s">[Graham]</a>: Nicole Bramley was transposed for Nicole Morrell, so we'll make those updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=434.588s">[Graham]</a>: is there, before we take a motion to approve, just a reminder, the finance subcommittee in particular, if you were not present at the meeting, join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=677.111s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so as I was saying, I don't know what you all were able to hear, so I'm just going to repeat what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=684.299s">[Graham]</a>: The finance subcommittee was streamed to YouTube, so if you weren't at the meeting, I would encourage you to watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=692.167s">[Graham]</a>: Alicia Hunt from our planning office joined us, and we had a good conversation about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=698.86s">[Graham]</a>: potential sites for the high school should this site not be the one that is desirable from a planner's perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=707.727s">[Graham]</a>: So it just was like a really sort of interesting conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=711.49s">[Graham]</a>: Particularly, we talked a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=712.971s">[Graham]</a>: We talked a little bit about transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=714.813s">[Graham]</a>: And her planner's hat says that transportation should not be the reason we do or don't do something with the building, because transportation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=728.993s">[Graham]</a>: can be moved to align with where the building ultimately resides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=734.338s">[Graham]</a>: So just like good information, more sort of like fact finding and starting to engage the right people that I would recommend everybody listen to if they have a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=745.007s">[Graham]</a>: There are two amendments that do need to be made to correctly list Nicole Morrell in both the minutes and in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=756.12s">[Graham]</a>: And then other than that, I will look for a motion to approve the consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=761.603s">[Graham]</a>: There are no other objections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=765.726s">[Graham]</a>: Motion approved by Mayor Lungo Kern, seconded by Dr. Edward Vinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=772.971s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=776.253s">[Graham]</a>: Jenny Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=777.514s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor Lungo Kern, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=785.558s">[Graham]</a>: Marta Cabral?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=787.04s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=788.541s">[Graham]</a>: Libby Brown?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=789.642s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=790.782s">[Graham]</a>: Marissa Desmond?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=792.344s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=793.264s">[Graham]</a>: Maria Dorsey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=794.405s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=794.926s">[Graham]</a>: Brian Hilliard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=795.806s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=796.907s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy Keene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=797.788s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=798.148s">[Graham]</a>: Emily Lazaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=800.17s">[Graham]</a>: Nicole Morrell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=801.591s">[Graham]</a>: Erin Orapade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=802.371s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=802.772s">[Graham]</a>: Luke Prisner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=805.133s">[Graham]</a>: 14 in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=808.776s">[Graham]</a>: Motion, the minutes are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=811.554s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the next thing on our list is actually, um, to take what I'm going to call a brief introductory tour of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=820.419s">[Graham]</a>: I think there's at least some number of people who have never done that before here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=825.882s">[Graham]</a>: Um, or maybe you've seen bits and parts of the building, but I thought it would be a good time to sort of give everyone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=833.203s">[Graham]</a>: some sort of helpful framework that says like, what even all are we talking about that goes on in this building today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=839.568s">[Graham]</a>: And so we wanted to spend a little bit of time and we're gonna try to be back here by seven to take you all on a little walking tour of the facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=852.898s">[Graham]</a>: So for those of you that are on the phone and have joined us remotely, we're gonna,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=860.894s">[Graham]</a>: not take you with us so that you don't feel like you're in the Blair Witch Project as we move around the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=866.077s">[Graham]</a>: And we will put up a note on the Zoom just so people know that we're on a walking tour of the building and we expect to be back about seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=878.265s">[Graham]</a>: So for those of you who have joined us remotely, we'll see you back here at seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=893.88s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think we'll do this more than one time because right now, again, we're like in the middle of the paperwork phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=900.526s">[Graham]</a>: I just thought it might be helpful at a high level, but when we start talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=905.367s">[Graham]</a>: you know, when we start getting into the place where we're talking about design and feasibility, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to do that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=911.332s">[Graham]</a>: There will be lots of opportunities even for the community to come in and do that as part of the communication plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=916.316s">[Graham]</a>: So yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=919.138s">[Graham]</a>: But, uh, and certainly if you want to come in before then just let me know and I'll have I'll arrange it with somebody to give you a personal tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=929.306s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=931.728s">[Graham]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=935.676s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so we're gonna go on a little walking tour here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3754.553s">[Graham]</a>: So we just got back from a brief walking tour of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3760.416s">[Graham]</a>: We saw just like a little bit of everything, just to give people some perspective on what all this building is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3768.18s">[Graham]</a>: And you know, it's pluses and minuses, I guess I'll say, and we'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3773.562s">[Graham]</a>: Plus, we have lots of marble at our disposal, minus, you know, many minuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3779.345s">[Graham]</a>: So having...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3786.078s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, the next item on our agenda is to take a look at our chapter 74 viability form, which we looked at last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3799.042s">[Graham]</a>: So it's in your packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3800.142s">[Graham]</a>: I sent it, we sent it out yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3805.214s">[Graham]</a>: We at our 520 school committee meeting, Chad and Dr. Cushing presented to the school committee about some things that they would like to see us study from an expansion perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3820.421s">[Graham]</a>: So there are four programs, auto, electrical,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3827.119s">[Graham]</a>: cosmetology and health assisting that are current programs here that are space constrained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3833.463s">[Graham]</a>: So we are, we, the school committee unanimously approved that we study an expansion of those programs from a space perspective when we get to the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3845.167s">[Graham]</a>: And in addition, the school committee approved that we study dental assisting, veterinary science, criminal justice and protective services, plumbing and HVAC, and information systems, networking, cybersecurity, all as separate vocations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3865.298s">[Graham]</a>: So five new vocational programs under study from a space perspective for the vocational school as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3872.361s">[Graham]</a>: So the school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3874.907s">[Graham]</a>: MSBA requires that we follow all the rules and regs that DESE has around Chapter 74 programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3882.09s">[Graham]</a>: So they all require licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3884.111s">[Graham]</a>: They all require like all the things that would normally have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3888.293s">[Graham]</a>: They also will ask DESE to weigh in on us studying these programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3892.235s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a variety of criteria, including that there's demand in the area for those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3899.237s">[Graham]</a>: and that the school committee is in support of studying those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3903.201s">[Graham]</a>: So we've checked all of those boxes, that presentation and the vote and the minutes will be sent to MSBA with this form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3913.089s">[Graham]</a>: But I wanted to bring this form back to you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3918.414s">[Graham]</a>: I did talk to our contact at MSBA this morning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3923.911s">[Graham]</a>: We are not required to take votes on these eligibility program documents as the school building committee, but I think it's important that this group provide their input and weigh in and take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3934.455s">[Graham]</a>: So I would like to see us do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3937.257s">[Graham]</a>: My hope is that if you all have any comments tonight, having reviewed this, we can take a vote to approve this document as amended, and then we will submit this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3948.441s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to open the floor in case anybody had questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3952.782s">[Graham]</a>: comments, thoughts about what is here, before we move any sort of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3960.327s">[Graham]</a>: Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3982.79s">[Graham]</a>: I was like, auditorium, auditorium is ringing a bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3985.613s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, sorry, this is the chapter 74 one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3988.758s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, we reviewed it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3990.26s">[Graham]</a>: And since then, or not last week, but at our last meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=3998.23s">[Graham]</a>: Since then, all the information has been filled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4002.113s">[Graham]</a>: Our proposed capacity information has been fleshed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4007.737s">[Graham]</a>: We've noted the school committee's support for the new programs and finished filling out the rest of this form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4014.682s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other questions about this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4123.157s">[Graham]</a>: Because we don't function like a standalone vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4126.979s">[Graham]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4169.849s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, I think the other sort of thing because we had this actually this conversation like very early like back in February, the first time we met, where I was like, Hey guys I need you to like really think about all these things and fill out these forms and like, we need to do a lickety split, so they haven't like kicked me out of their office just yet which is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4190.123s">[Graham]</a>: but we had this conversation and I think there's like the other variables are you know yes MSBA is going to pay for a portion of the building but we also as a community are going to pay for a portion of the building and it's a much more complicated story to tell to say we're going to make it bigger than our students need and we're going to pay for that at a hundred percent because our enrollment certification won't support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4216.452s">[Graham]</a>: to be enrollment from other districts, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4218.974s">[Graham]</a>: So that's sort of the balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4221.797s">[Graham]</a>: And so we actually sort of stayed towards like the current model of if there's capacity, we would continue to take students like Chad does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4231.525s">[Graham]</a>: And with the expansion, like the expansion that we're talking about and the new programming, I think we could see again that there's capacity across the programming, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4241.014s">[Graham]</a>: It's a little bit hard to say I think but that was sort of the calculus as we were thinking about how like the point of view to take to put this stuff together which was like we felt like it would be too hard of a sell to the community to say let's pay 100% for the extra space<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4259.52s">[Graham]</a>: for programming to tuition in which may or may not ultimately sort of get us where we need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4267.565s">[Graham]</a>: So that was the conversation that we had certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4272.607s">[Graham]</a>: That is just like one point of view, but that was sort of where we landed as we put this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4283.203s">[Graham]</a>: Other questions, comments, concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4297.45s">[Graham]</a>: This is the Chapter 74 form?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4301.051s">[Graham]</a>: No, no, you're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4301.732s">[Graham]</a>: We'll get to you in just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4306.054s">[Graham]</a>: So are there any other Chapter 74 questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4325.856s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so there's a motion on the floor to approve this document by Mayor Lungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4330.117s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4331.658s">[Graham]</a>: Second by Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4333.919s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4341.225s">[Graham]</a>: I feel like I could almost do it, but I wrote in my brand new notebook in the front, so I remember you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4348.027s">[Graham]</a>: OK, Jenny Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4382.167s">[Graham]</a>: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4384.769s">[Graham]</a>: The form is approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4389.673s">[Graham]</a>: OK, Karen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4393.149s">[Graham]</a>: So we will submit that, that will be the third of five deliverables that we are on the hook for to be on our way out of this eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4403.436s">[Graham]</a>: So excellent work, thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4407.178s">[Graham]</a>: The other document that you have in front of you is item number five on the agenda, which is the educational profile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4417.524s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I'm going to take a few minutes and just walk through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4420.467s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I think there's probably a lot of questions and this is still very much a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4425.392s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we are aiming to get this, um, updated and completed as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4431.678s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and I'm hoping by next week we'll have something that's pretty darn close for you all to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4437.223s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but let me walk you through what's here and maybe we can take questions like section by section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4442.569s">[Graham]</a>: So section one talks about district-wide facilities as they exist right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4448.213s">[Graham]</a>: So this is to say, this is what is in the building right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4452.857s">[Graham]</a>: The chart that you see was widely pre-populated by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4458.381s">[Graham]</a>: So they're trying to get a view of the whole entire district and the square footage space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4464.145s">[Graham]</a>: We had to make some updates and some adjustments, particularly to the square footage that they had on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4471.169s">[Graham]</a>: So those have been updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4474.591s">[Graham]</a>: Item B is a description of how students progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4478.713s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4479.254s">[Graham]</a>: Are there questions about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4480.194s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4514.046s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4517.367s">[Graham]</a>: I'm guessing it's, yeah, the vocational piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4525.618s">[Graham]</a>: Was it an agricultural school at any time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4527.499s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4527.72s">[Graham]</a>: We would love that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4581.078s">[Graham]</a>: OK, so we can double check the square footage of Medford High and the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4590.112s">[Graham]</a>: Question B really talks about how students move through the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4594.796s">[Graham]</a>: So this talks about, you know, they're wanting to know things like, is it a lottery?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4600.861s">[Graham]</a>: Is it a neighborhood school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4602.242s">[Graham]</a>: How do you move from fifth to sixth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4604.104s">[Graham]</a>: So this narrative talks about our four elementary schools, you know, how many schools we have, and it talks about the transitions from five to six being a lottery for the two middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4617.875s">[Graham]</a>: everybody comes to Medford High and then it does talk a little bit about the freshman exploratory program as well as like how students pick into a CTE program if they're desired and then it sort of references the wait list and references our chapter 74 form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4634.439s">[Graham]</a>: So it's just really to give the folks that are trying to get a feel for our district like how do students move about the district all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4672.864s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4673.345s">[Graham]</a>: Section two, this is where you'll see sort of the, again, current state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4679.533s">[Graham]</a>: How many classrooms are considered each of these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4684.495s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so thank you to Marta and her team, among others who went through and counted all the spaces in the building to say, like, here are all the things that are happening in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4699.669s">[Graham]</a>: We will do another review of this, but this is just to sort of tally up all of the spaces that exist in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4709.257s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4711.587s">[Graham]</a>: In a related question, item B talks about like, how are these spaces currently used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4718.973s">[Graham]</a>: And there is a narrative around, as the form requests, course spaces, specialized spaces, non-traditional spaces, and class policy, class five policy, all of which are requested in the question in the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4775.059s">[Graham]</a>: Maria?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4775.419s">[Graham]</a>: The medium of the library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4790.586s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4792.327s">[Graham]</a>: So can I send this to you and have you make some edits to it and send it back to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4797.789s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4799.31s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4805.791s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions about the information in item B?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4814.637s">[Graham]</a>: We also talk a little bit on the top of page seven about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4820.35s">[Graham]</a>: the some of the rentals that happen with our community partners, as well as the central office being housed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4827.873s">[Graham]</a>: And all of the all of the administrative offices, the administrative offices, I believe, are another thing where they're not considered part of the school from a reimbursement perspective, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4839.797s">[Graham]</a>: There obviously has to be an administrative space available to operate the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4846.301s">[Graham]</a>: So, you know, there's any number of questions about how that could happen in our like new reconfigured space, whether they stay where they are or they.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4856.868s">[Graham]</a>: perhaps move to the Curtis-Tufts because we want to co-locate the Curtis-Tufts program on this campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4863.191s">[Graham]</a>: So there's any number of things that the feasibility study will look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4866.832s">[Graham]</a>: And so the important thing for us is just to say, yes, the administrative offices are housed in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4871.994s">[Graham]</a>: And at the end of all of this, they need a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4874.755s">[Graham]</a>: So any questions about B?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4883.303s">[Graham]</a>: Um item c again current state what is our current<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4888.883s">[Graham]</a>: teaching methodology, class size policies, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4893.725s">[Graham]</a>: So this is a description, thank you to the administrative team who has taken a lot of time to try to be complete and comprehensive about both like the teaching methodology and some of the specialized programming we have within the building, including the TLP program, the transitions program, our English learners,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4919.19s">[Graham]</a>: et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4919.85s">[Graham]</a>: We do have some conversation about technology in this section, and then some of the things that are quite limiting around reliable connectivity access to the internet, et cetera, at the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4931.438s">[Graham]</a>: Any questions about this so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4935.36s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, section three,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4948.11s">[Graham]</a>: is about what are we proposing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4952.014s">[Graham]</a>: What is it that we want to see in this building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4955.717s">[Graham]</a>: I did have a conversation with our MSBA contact today and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4961.045s">[Graham]</a>: we did I did ask some questions about what sort of the finality of what is in this document and she assured me that this is like a jumping off point so that MSBA can get a feel for the kind of building we're envisioning and that whoever we ultimately bring on as an owner's project manager or to do a feasibility study can start to learn about us through these documents that we've had to create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4985.623s">[Graham]</a>: And the reason I was asking is because I did have a chance to go to Arlington and perhaps sometime this summer we'll try to schedule another tour with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4994.067s">[Graham]</a>: There were spaces in the high school that like if you asked us to fill out a document today to say what should be in this high school, like we couldn't envision that space because it's just not something any of us have ever like seen or considered as an option because it doesn't exist here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5010.533s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5014.662s">[Graham]</a>: what we put here doesn't limit the thinking of the people who are coming in who build school buildings for a living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5020.044s">[Graham]</a>: And they assured me that, no, this is a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5024.565s">[Graham]</a>: Very much, they want to know sort of where our head is at and what they're thinking about and what we're thinking about, but also that all of that visioning will happen led by the folks doing the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5036.95s">[Graham]</a>: So those designers will really sort of lead that charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5041.391s">[Graham]</a>: The other conversation that I had today was with one of our Medford High School nurses and our district physician, and they reached out knowing that we were sort of in this pipeline and process to ask about whether we should be trying to provide space for an in-school health clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5064.504s">[Graham]</a>: And they talked about, Dr. Sabia talked about some of the programs that he is part of in Malden, in Everett, and in Revere, where they partner with Cambridge Health Alliance and they provide health services here that are over and above what happens in a nurse's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5083.571s">[Graham]</a>: And so they had some particular information and insights about the kind of space that they would need to be able to hold such a facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5092.279s">[Graham]</a>: Most often those programs start out as grant funded by the Department of Public Health, which sounds amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5099.185s">[Graham]</a>: And so they just wanted to say like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5101.227s">[Graham]</a>: hey like we just want to make sure you know that we're here and we're thinking about these things um so that's something that I told her like we needed to like connect back with the district administration and talk about that and figure out like if and how it should go on this form but you could you should maybe expect to see some change there on the form in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5118.931s">[Graham]</a>: week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5119.231s">[Graham]</a>: So I had like a 30 minute conversation with them and my wheels were turning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5123.314s">[Graham]</a>: And I was like, this, this is the time to say we're envisioning something like that as a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5128.136s">[Graham]</a>: We certainly want to study how to have and provide that kind of space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5134.961s">[Graham]</a>: Questions about that, Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5216.598s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, no, I think that's a great suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5218.86s">[Graham]</a>: We can add all of that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5222.002s">[Graham]</a>: And then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5224.16s">[Graham]</a>: If any of you, the McGlynn Playground project is under construction right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5231.646s">[Graham]</a>: And it actually is an amazing use of outdoor space, and particularly for outdoor classrooms, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5237.07s">[Graham]</a>: So keep your eyes on that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5239.292s">[Graham]</a>: It's supposed to be done sometime this summer, hopefully before school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5243.935s">[Graham]</a>: But it is really stunning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5246.057s">[Graham]</a>: And the outside space is very, very amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5252.967s">[Graham]</a>: be thinking about that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5254.369s">[Graham]</a>: And at one point, if I remember, we went after a big grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5261.519s">[Graham]</a>: This was years ago, because it was before Chad's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5266.625s">[Graham]</a>: Suzanne was at the Brooks, Joan you were here, and it was the entire grant was written to become a like very Fells-centric educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5278.928s">[Graham]</a>: Does that ring a bell to you all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5282.549s">[Graham]</a>: It was a high school grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5284.829s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if it was through Bloomberg Foundations or it was some big, big, big grant where like it would have re-envisioned this building and it was architected by Heidi Riccio and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5298.529s">[Graham]</a>: I forget, Edward, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5301.951s">[Graham]</a>: Perella, thank you, Mr. Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5304.732s">[Graham]</a>: And they submitted this very significant grant that had a lot to do with sort of being anchored to the fells as like a central like teaching point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5316.58s">[Graham]</a>: Does that ring any bells to anybody who's been around for a long time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5333.297s">[Graham]</a>: This was just a grant application, like we didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5339.7s">[Graham]</a>: It was a grant application and we didn't get the grants, but there was something submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5345.023s">[Graham]</a>: So I just I wonder if there is something in there if we can locate it that would be worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5356.018s">[Graham]</a>: thinking about in terms of inclusion from an outdoor space perspective, because if I remember correctly, the whole entire like genesis of the program they were proposing had to do with like being very anchored to the fact that the fell sat right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5373.726s">[Graham]</a>: Nicole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5375.507s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5397.074s">[Graham]</a>: I think it can't hurt for us to describe our intentions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5401.996s">[Graham]</a>: Like that we, you know, that we do have climate concerns on this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5408.781s">[Graham]</a>: on this physical site, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5410.424s">[Graham]</a>: Like we have had issues because we sit right by the belt and every now and again the water pours in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5416.472s">[Graham]</a>: But I think to your point and to Luke's point, like we certainly need to make some space in this document to talk about the fields that are up high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5426.004s">[Graham]</a>: They are at their end of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5427.525s">[Graham]</a>: They're like more rubber than grass at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5432.049s">[Graham]</a>: So those fields need to be taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5434.45s">[Graham]</a>: There is a football practice field that's very much in disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5439.234s">[Graham]</a>: There's another practice field up there that I'm sure somebody will tell me has a name and I don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5445.719s">[Graham]</a>: But there are all these other like little things all over the campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5451.543s">[Graham]</a>: And I think if like we were like dreaming really big,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5455.822s">[Graham]</a>: you wouldn't have to go across town to get to the football stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5459.983s">[Graham]</a>: You wouldn't have to go somewhere else to get to a softball field or a baseball field or a track, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5466.565s">[Graham]</a>: So maybe some sort of, maybe we can add something that talks about a more cohesive vision for our athletics properties as part of this project that service the students here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5481.85s">[Graham]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5649.558s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5650.658s">[Graham]</a>: Emily?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5679.764s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5746.346s">[Graham]</a>: So I think I've heard like a million good ideas so far and I'm wondering if there are any volunteers who might take a shot at like a paragraph or some sort of narrative about any of the topics that we've talked about so far to sort of help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5764.821s">[Graham]</a>: make light work of what is like otherwise a really heavy lift for the administration at this time of year when graduation is tomorrow and all the other things are happening before between now and the end of the year so is there I will see if I can't talk to some folks who might know where that grant application is and and you guys can go um in the can hop in Howard's Wayback Machine and um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5793.021s">[Graham]</a>: get in the time machine and see what you can come up with from that perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5796.543s">[Graham]</a>: Because I know that at the time, I was like, wow, this is so amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5800.766s">[Graham]</a>: And it was just really well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5802.927s">[Graham]</a>: So there just might be something there that helps draw that anchoring to the outside space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5809.412s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll take a look for that to see if there isn't something that we can pull in and integrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5813.354s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5866.872s">[Graham]</a>: Well, I guess my thought is there's a way for us in this document to say like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5872.355s">[Graham]</a>: We are not tied to this location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5874.477s">[Graham]</a>: And we have identified others that potentially are worthy of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5880.462s">[Graham]</a>: But as it relates to this location, here are some things that we would think are important if we are planning to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5889.129s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that's perfectly rational and reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5892.631s">[Graham]</a>: So if there is somebody who would like to take a crack at like the athletic spaces or the outdoor classroom spaces or the sort of anchoring to the fells, like if anyone wants to just take a shot at writing a paragraph or something and sending it to me, like I'm happy to do the integration if there are any volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6007.36s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6010.503s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy, the other thing that I'm thinking about is like the very active conversation about the arts that we are having in the community at this very moment and wondering if there isn't something that we should be adding about sort of like how we're envisioning like the artistic spaces and if you might think about writing something about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6037.096s">[Graham]</a>: Anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6055.929s">[Graham]</a>: That came up as well as having space for that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6060.905s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, it was like a really exciting conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6064.349s">[Graham]</a>: I was like, what about all the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6071.016s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6072.557s">[Graham]</a>: So Maria, I think the other space that like could require or like, do with a little bit of love would be the library space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6080.986s">[Graham]</a>: Could you take a crack at that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6083.209s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6134.368s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing, Lori, that's gonna need to be sort of flushed in here is some conversation about the co-location of Curtis Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6142.194s">[Graham]</a>: So we might do with a paragraph from you about that vision, if you could work on that, Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6149.019s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6163.72s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions about this section so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6166.882s">[Graham]</a>: We've got 10 minutes to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6171.785s">[Graham]</a>: That's a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6172.766s">[Graham]</a>: So we're scheduled to meet next Wednesday, June 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6178.489s">[Graham]</a>: Is it Tuesday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6179.13s">[Graham]</a>: It's a Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6180.451s">[Graham]</a>: It's a Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6181.331s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6182.492s">[Graham]</a>: So if you all could, by any means, get it to me by Friday, I can then do some integrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6190.717s">[Graham]</a>: And if you can't, it's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6193.826s">[Graham]</a>: give it to me when you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6199.633s">[Graham]</a>: Midnight Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6202.016s">[Graham]</a>: I'm gonna I'll work on it over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6203.497s">[Graham]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6207.503s">[Graham]</a>: Um, item C is, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6210.507s">[Graham]</a>: Still a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6211.949s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the administrative team has some work to do to be able to describe that piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6217.076s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so that there's nothing for you all to review there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6219.679s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then section four is about community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6224.505s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and it talks about, um, some of the community engagement we have already done about Curtis Tufts and whether to co-locate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6233.227s">[Graham]</a>: It also talks about, um, some of the communications and community engagement subcommittee work, um, in terms of how we plan to engage the community in this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6243.109s">[Graham]</a>: And it closes, um, by saying that certainly we will need a debt exclusion to fully fund this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6248.81s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but I think Maria had some questions about this, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6252.071s">[Graham]</a>: this section for community engagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6256.272s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, Emily, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6257.533s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6611.792s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, this is just a draft review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6617.079s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, so everybody who has been found told to write something please go ahead and send that to me, I will do the integration of that information and then we will take another look at it next Wednesday and we'll decide are we like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6633.368s">[Graham]</a>: feeling good about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6634.249s">[Graham]</a>: Do we need more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6635.211s">[Graham]</a>: You know, how do we, you know, how do we sort of balance, you know, speed and completeness?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6641.199s">[Graham]</a>: Obviously, that's always sort of the challenge, but we're on a good track and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6649.375s">[Graham]</a>: I think all the feedback today was really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6651.657s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you all for, thank you for your feedback and your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6657.322s">[Graham]</a>: Next time we'll review this document and hopefully we'll take a first, maybe last look at the maintenance submission that has to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6665.649s">[Graham]</a>: Again, doesn't require this committee's review, but I think it's important that you all know what those questions and answers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6673.535s">[Graham]</a>: We'll see how far we can get in the drafting of those answers and then look at that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6680.038s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing I wanted to do before everyone leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6683.96s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, where's my schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6685.501s">[Graham]</a>: We have scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6696.81s">[Graham]</a>: still, we have a meeting on the 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6699.873s">[Graham]</a>: And then we had a subcommittee meeting that was a TBD on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6706.498s">[Graham]</a>: We then decided we would use that for the communications and community engagement subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6711.082s">[Graham]</a>: However, I have a date with my 11-year-old nephews to take them to see the Michael Jackson musical that evening, so I cannot attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6722.672s">[Graham]</a>: Apparently all fifth grade boys go through that phase and we are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6727.439s">[Graham]</a>: So I need to move that meeting time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6730.903s">[Graham]</a>: So I will reach out to the communications subcommittee and we'll find another time where we can have another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6737.272s">[Graham]</a>: There are two meetings on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6741.48s">[Graham]</a>: It won in July, won in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6744.862s">[Graham]</a>: We may or may not need those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6746.904s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe we can use those as like a tour date to go see Arlington or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6753.928s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we, depending on how far we are able to get through the other documents, like we may do a Zoom only meeting at some point before the end of June to finish our deliverables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6765.095s">[Graham]</a>: The last deliverable is actually not an action for this group to take, but it's a vote for the city council to take to authorize the funding for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6774.645s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor and I are working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6776.627s">[Graham]</a>: MSBA is reviewing the proposed language that will go up on the council agenda probably the week of the 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6786.537s">[Graham]</a>: but we'll keep you all posted on when that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6788.538s">[Graham]</a>: So it's a really, the MSBA has to approve the language, the council has to vote it very specifically, but we're all on track for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6796.161s">[Graham]</a>: So the last piece of what we have to do in eligibility is information that we'll work with Director Hunt's office around community growth projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6808.346s">[Graham]</a>: So we are working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6809.887s">[Graham]</a>: So there's an enrollment piece on the school side and then there's a city piece<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6813.789s">[Graham]</a>: that has to get submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6814.97s">[Graham]</a>: So I am actively working with Director Hunt on that and hopefully we'll be able to get all that stuff like organized and put into the system in short order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6825.124s">[Graham]</a>: So we're on track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6827.367s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6829.189s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6831.185s">[Graham]</a>: That is everything that I have for all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6833.026s">[Graham]</a>: So just a note to say like, bear with us as we get through the rest of the scheduling of all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6837.868s">[Graham]</a>: And with that, I think we're at the end of our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6843.29s">[Graham]</a>: Our next meeting is on June 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6846.851s">[Graham]</a>: And then my goal is to set the rest of the, my goal is to set our calendar for the fall once the school committee calendar is set, so we'll do that and then we'll set this calendar so you all can put it in your calendars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6858.544s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6860.086s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6861.187s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Luke, seconded by Tracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3161.286s">[Graham]</a>: Memo Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3163.447s">[Graham]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for stepping up and in advance for all of your creative ideas that we've already started talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3172.091s">[Graham]</a>: And look in your email box because I have a food allergy question for you in your new role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3177.954s">[Graham]</a>: I'll try to send you something later tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3179.734s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4533.077s">[Graham]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4536.399s">[Graham]</a>: When we look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4538.732s">[Graham]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, moderator, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4561.713s">[Graham]</a>: a normal part of the practice that like we're monitoring ourselves and there are no surprises when we get to somebody else monitoring us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4614.491s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4614.931s">[Graham]</a>: And I think it would be great for us to be able to have some sort of report from you say in like January before we crush into all things budget and end of school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4627.783s">[Graham]</a>: So it would be, I think if we think about like December, January timeframe would be a good time to hear back from you about what kind of independent auditing you're doing and whether you're finding that we are solving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4639.451s">[Graham]</a>: the problem for these and the other measures as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4643.132s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5028.251s">[Graham]</a>: I see here that you're also requesting that we support an administrative action review to strengthen school district tobacco policies to ensure that e-cigarettes, vaping, nicotine pouches are fully addressed in a preventative and restorative approaches that focus on health outcomes consistent with our mission to support students in the schoolhouse and provide opportunities for community dialogue on health risks of all tobacco and nicotine use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5053.223s">[Graham]</a>: and encourage campuses to promote health messaging to educators, students, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5058.624s">[Graham]</a>: I am fully on board with that, but I want to remind everybody that we have a suspension policy that limits our use of out-of-school suspension as a disciplinary measure to a series of criteria that were laid out in the memo by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5075.967s">[Graham]</a>: And this is not on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5079.547s">[Graham]</a>: And I just want to call that out because I have heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5083.064s">[Graham]</a>: situations where students are being suspended for that reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5086.006s">[Graham]</a>: And I just want to say that suspending a kid so they can go home and vape is not the answer to tightening up our policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5096.553s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm in support of this and happy to otherwise make a motion to recommend that we support the tobacco and nicotine free generation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5829.146s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take item 2024-28 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5922.648s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor, I just had a couple of questions or potential amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5927.895s">[Graham]</a>: Sarah Silver, PB): Um, so I would like to maybe amend the motion to approve with the addition of a meeting on Monday, June 9 Sarah Silver, PB): We inevitably cannot get out of June with two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5943.769s">[Graham]</a>: It's just not possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5945.25s">[Graham]</a>: So I would rather<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5946.914s">[Graham]</a>: see us have the time scheduled and decide we don't need it, then be left scrambling for a date, which we're actively doing right now to do the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5956.258s">[Graham]</a>: And we're like running out of days in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5958.699s">[Graham]</a>: And there's a lot of people like waiting with bated breath to hear what we have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5961.801s">[Graham]</a>: So one amendment would be the addition of June 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5966.763s">[Graham]</a>: And I would also like to propose that we put the two budget hearings on this calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5972.225s">[Graham]</a>: And my proposal would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5974.681s">[Graham]</a>: Wednesday, February 26 and Wednesday, April 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5980.125s">[Graham]</a>: And I picked those Wednesdays because those are the weeks immediately following February and April vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5986.348s">[Graham]</a>: So I feel like a Monday budget meeting would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5989.429s">[Graham]</a>: A, be really hard for the administration to get ready for, but B, would be really hard for people to motivate to get to from a public perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5998.535s">[Graham]</a>: So in keeping with the resolution that we just passed, those would work within the timeline that we established, but I would like to see them just be added right to the calendar so that we can all put them in our calendars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6013.826s">[Graham]</a>: And if there's something that we decide that we don't need,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6017.108s">[Graham]</a>: That would be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6018.189s">[Graham]</a>: But also we sort of crush into the end of the year and there's not enough time to do all the things that we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6023.493s">[Graham]</a>: So I was hoping we could maybe add those few things so that we can chart a slightly better, less chaotic course next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6034.16s">[Graham]</a>: It would be 226 for the budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6036.582s">[Graham]</a>: A second budget hearing sort of if required on 430.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6045.273s">[Graham]</a>: And I would say if required, because there's some language about when we would do a second budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6053.617s">[Graham]</a>: And whoever is typing, could you just put if required right next to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6063.162s">[Graham]</a>: Is it you, Dr. Eby?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6067.804s">[Graham]</a>: It's Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6071.852s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, I was like, who's typing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6074.874s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6076.496s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other budget meeting to add to the calendar would be June 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6095.671s">[Graham]</a>: That June 9th wouldn't be a budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6097.452s">[Graham]</a>: It's just a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9992.153s">[Graham]</a>: Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=9994.376s">[Graham]</a>: I am the vice chair of the school committee, and I just wanted to let you all know that every time we look at a budget we have a chance to look into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10003.275s">[Graham]</a>: When we looked at the FY21 budget, we looked into a future where the Medford Public Schools was the only department in the entire city to say goodbye to humans who worked in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10014.061s">[Graham]</a>: And when we looked at the FY22 budget, we said, okay, things are better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10022.065s">[Graham]</a>: But also we had an inordinate amount of need that we had never seen before due to the recovery of students from the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10031.21s">[Graham]</a>: I don't remember FY23, so I think that means it was like a not noteworthy year, meaning we weren't at the brink of crisis, but also nothing was very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10041.612s">[Graham]</a>: When we looked at the FY24 budget, we looked forward and we said, this budget is incredibly fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10048.653s">[Graham]</a>: Those are words that we used on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10052.014s">[Graham]</a>: We also said that we would be using and exhausting our remaining ESSER funds to do what the city budget could not do for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10059.895s">[Graham]</a>: So when I look forward to the FY 25 budget, the budget proposed by the mayor, which includes work done by myself and others on the task force, it restores most much of the ask that we put forward to you all a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10075.833s">[Graham]</a>: It is not everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10077.679s">[Graham]</a>: That is sort of what compromise is all about, that everyone leaves just a little bit unhappy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10083.743s">[Graham]</a>: And so we do have work to do on the school side once this number passes, whatever that number is, to reconcile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10091.328s">[Graham]</a>: But when we looked forward, we saw a very bleak picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10094.931s">[Graham]</a>: We saw a destination of the leadership team of Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10099.033s">[Graham]</a>: We saw the elimination of six secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10101.655s">[Graham]</a>: We saw the elimination of many school teachers, four nurses, and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10107.879s">[Graham]</a>: We also were looking forward at an unknown number of $2.7 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10112.261s">[Graham]</a>: So to Anthony Guillen's point, the time is now to vote on this budget, because once you do, we have work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10120.683s">[Graham]</a>: And there's a whole bunch of humans who are waiting anxiously for that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10125.745s">[Graham]</a>: The school department is aware that this number is out on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10129.794s">[Graham]</a>: and I would ask that you move on this tonight because it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10134.76s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing I'll say is when I look into the future, I'm excited to fund budgets that say yes to the fire station that our firefighters deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10143.851s">[Graham]</a>: They have been waiting and they deserve to work in conditions that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10149.637s">[Graham]</a>: not substandard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10151.458s">[Graham]</a>: They deserve to work in a state-of-the-art facility just like our police do, just like our library does, just like I hope someday our students will and our teachers will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10163.382s">[Graham]</a>: And I look forward to saying yes to an amount of money for Bedford Public Schools that allows us not just to pull back from the brink, but also to say what do we need for the future so that we can say yes to pay equity for our paraprofessionals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10179.628s">[Graham]</a>: so that we can fix the high school schedule, that we can increase the access to the arts and so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10185.0s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, yes, yes is my answer to those three questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10188.662s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to talk to anybody who wants to talk about those details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10192.445s">[Graham]</a>: And the last thing I will say is thank you for being decisive tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10197.287s">[Graham]</a>: It's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10198.548s">[Graham]</a>: And most importantly, I look forward to talking to all the residents about what those possibilities mean for us in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10205.432s">[Graham]</a>: The last thing I'll say is that- This is the second last thing you say, but I'll give you 15 more seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10209.015s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10210.676s">[Graham]</a>: The last thing I'll say is that the MSBA building committee is working very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10215.098s">[Graham]</a>: I expect that you will see a request for free cash in your next meeting to fund the feasibility study, which is a critical step in the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10223.043s">[Graham]</a>: And in addition, when we talk about free cash, the other thing that is very much on topic in the school committee meetings is the many millions of dollars, I think north of 20, that are required to rehab the HVAC systems in both the Andrews<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10235.43s">[Graham]</a>: and the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10236.291s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that forthcoming to many people's questions about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10240.754s">[Graham]</a>: So those are one-time funds, one-time expenditures, and you can look forward to those at your doorstep soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=10245.838s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3.51s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, can you all hear me on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=21.474s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=22.995s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=25.754s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, let's get started so we can get finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=31.22s">[Graham]</a>: Are we recording?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=31.981s">[Graham]</a>: We're good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=32.562s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=186.547s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=187.027s">[Graham]</a>: Nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=188.027s">[Graham]</a>: in the affirmative, zero in the negative, six absent, the minutes are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=195.012s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so I just wanted to give you all a deliverable status overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=199.876s">[Graham]</a>: So again, we have five, we'll call it six things, but with five official things that have to be done in the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=207.282s">[Graham]</a>: The MSBA let us know that our, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=211.525s">[Graham]</a>: ICC has, which is the legal agreement, has been approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=215.77s">[Graham]</a>: So that is complete and approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=218.492s">[Graham]</a>: We have submitted our SBC form, our school building committee form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=222.296s">[Graham]</a>: They reviewed it and they have approved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=224.699s">[Graham]</a>: So we are done and approved on item number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=228.286s">[Graham]</a>: Um, last meeting, we approved, um, the chapter 74 form as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=233.03s">[Graham]</a>: That one has not been submitted yet, but that is just a matter of, um, collecting up all the paperwork and doing some final editing, and that will be submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=241.115s">[Graham]</a>: Um, item number four is the educational profile, which I am hopeful that we will, um, get to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=249.001s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then, um, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=254.264s">[Graham]</a>: Final pieces include the maintenance plan profile, which we will talk about today and potentially provide an approval by this group to go ahead and submit that as soon as it's complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=265.726s">[Graham]</a>: And then the final big thing that we will have to do there's well there's two more things so there's data from the about enrollment that has to be submitted that is in process does not require approval of this body but we are working with Alicia Hunt as well as Jerry McHugh who's our CFO here and are on track to get that completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=287.466s">[Graham]</a>: The very last thing that we will have to do is earmark funds for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=292.27s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to let you all know that you can expect to see that on the city council agenda on the 25th, which is a Tuesday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=302.139s">[Graham]</a>: The request will come from the mayor to use free cash to set aside funds for the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=311.307s">[Graham]</a>: The exact amount is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=314.029s">[Graham]</a>: a little bit of a TBD because there's a little bit more legwork to do to make sure that we get the right number, but we know what that range needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=322.051s">[Graham]</a>: So we have a couple more conversations to have, and then the mayor will make that request to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=327.372s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully the council will approve that on the 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=330.973s">[Graham]</a>: MSBA has already signed off on the language that will go before the council to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=336.014s">[Graham]</a>: They are fine with it and they are ready to watch and hear that that's approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=340.536s">[Graham]</a>: They did say that they will schedule our enrollment meeting like once that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=346.38s">[Graham]</a>: And so the fact that we're going to do that in June is good because then we can accelerate that piece of it, which really would position us for a much earlier view by the board than next February, which is when we would sort of be scheduled if we take full time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=362.734s">[Graham]</a>: So that's just a quick update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=366.517s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=377.847s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=379.628s">[Graham]</a>: The other just like announcement related is that we have finished the first draft of the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=386.854s">[Graham]</a>: I'm gonna ask Tom to send that out to everybody after this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=391.817s">[Graham]</a>: So if you wanna take a look, if you have any questions or comments or suggestions, please, by all means, let Tom know what they are and he will work on integrating any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=403.446s">[Graham]</a>: We are on our way there and sort of positioned for being able to use that to start to talk to the community when we are ready for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=414.276s">[Graham]</a>: And then the last thing we did have a subcommittee meeting earmarked for June 20th for the communication subcommittee and that meeting will be canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=428.394s">[Graham]</a>: And I will reach out to the communications team to find another Zoom time for us so we can move forward on some of the preparation things that we were talking about at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=440.184s">[Graham]</a>: But I will tell you for sure it will not happen probably until the beginning of July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=448.432s">[Graham]</a>: because I don't have any minutes left in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=450.954s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm sure that's true of everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=453.236s">[Graham]</a>: It's June and it's just sort of a full court press.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=456.158s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll spend some time in the summer to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=459.221s">[Graham]</a>: And our summer meetings will be on the schedule unless we are in a true holding pattern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=464.345s">[Graham]</a>: And in which case I will let you know and we'll cancel those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=467.267s">[Graham]</a>: But my plan is for the summer meetings to be Zoom only so everyone can be where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=472.652s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=474.994s">[Graham]</a>: Is everybody okay with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=478.976s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=480.677s">[Graham]</a>: OK, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=481.057s">[Graham]</a>: OK, so on to the next item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=485.258s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to take a look at the ed profile again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=488.12s">[Graham]</a>: What I did since we last spoke is integrate feedback that I got from lots of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=497.223s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=498.244s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Libby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=500.305s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Luke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=501.618s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Tracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=502.459s">[Graham]</a>: You guys really crushed it in the performing arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=507.182s">[Graham]</a>: And what I wanted to do, what I'm hoping that we can do tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=511.726s">[Graham]</a>: Hey, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=513.127s">[Graham]</a>: What I'm hoping we can do tonight is sort of collect any additional feedback that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=518.05s">[Graham]</a>: There are some placeholders in here that are contingent on the staff having some time to meet with all the district administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=524.555s">[Graham]</a>: And so what I'm hoping that we can do is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=528.971s">[Graham]</a>: talk about what we see here, talk about any additional suggestions, agree on the things that are listed here as placeholders, and provide an approval as amended and to be completed so that, you know, and we'll share the final copy with you all, but if you do that, that will give me the leeway to sort of collect up all the last pieces and get this submitted as well, which I would like to do before June 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=556.075s">[Graham]</a>: So a couple of big changes that I made, let's see, are start on page... So one big change that I made starts on page eight, which provides a deeper description of the library in its current form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=579.904s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=582.135s">[Graham]</a>: So that is one change that has been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=585.638s">[Graham]</a>: And then there is reference to the library as well, down in the non-traditional and other spaces section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=600.971s">[Graham]</a>: And then if we fast forward to page 12,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=612.453s">[Graham]</a>: This is the section that got a really substantive overhaul based on all the things that were provided to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=624.105s">[Graham]</a>: So at the top of page 13 in course spaces, still to be added to this document, just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=634.301s">[Graham]</a>: everybody to sort of shake their head and say yes, those are the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=639.132s">[Graham]</a>: There is some discussion about Curtis Tufts that has to go into this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=644.595s">[Graham]</a>: There is discussion about early EEC, early education and childcare, so that is both our Chapter 74 program as well as our MEET programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=655.519s">[Graham]</a>: Kids Corner, which is our daycare program for Medford Public Schools employees, and certainly they are at capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=670.22s">[Graham]</a>: I think there would be no shortage of people interested in that service if there was space to increase enrollment and open that up to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=677.822s">[Graham]</a>: And then the final thing that is on the to be added list in core spaces is that that felt integration project that we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=685.744s">[Graham]</a>: I know Suzanne was looking for some information about what that said so that we can sort of paint a like sort of paint some broad strokes about that as well in terms of this is our like sort of goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=698.092s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll stop talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=699.053s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any questions, thoughts, changes about the course basis section?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=715.118s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=737.274s">[Graham]</a>: That will all happen in the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=739.316s">[Graham]</a>: So that is some time from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=741.998s">[Graham]</a>: I did, in some places, try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=751.508s">[Graham]</a>: sort of describe that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=752.889s">[Graham]</a>: And it's probably buried in one of these sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=755.13s">[Graham]</a>: And so what the other thing I'll do is find it and put it at the top of this section as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=764.554s">[Graham]</a>: But yeah, okay, so I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=770.117s">[Graham]</a>: I am making a note that we will add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=850.447s">[Graham]</a>: So I asked a similar question of MSBA when I spoke with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=855.628s">[Graham]</a>: And what they said was they used information in this section to get a feel for the kind of building we're trying to create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=864.69s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that is like an answer and a non-answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=871.291s">[Graham]</a>: And I thought about that, too, as I was pulling in some of Tracy's content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=879.109s">[Graham]</a>: to bring that to this group because I read it and I was like, I can see what he's talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=887.787s">[Graham]</a>: Like I can visualize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=890.606s">[Graham]</a>: what he's saying when he talks about like the performing arts space in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=897.068s">[Graham]</a>: And so I found it very helpful to read that to get a sense of like, do I agree with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=902.91s">[Graham]</a>: Yes or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=903.39s">[Graham]</a>: I think I did for the, you know, for the by and large, and I'm not an expert in space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=909.332s">[Graham]</a>: So I was like, Tracy thinks we probably do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=912.853s">[Graham]</a>: So I let I put it in here, sort of with that in mind, which is to say, like, if the if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=919.727s">[Graham]</a>: designer or MSBA is trying to understand where our head is at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=926.668s">[Graham]</a>: I think this sufficiently describes how we're currently feeling about the performing arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=931.869s">[Graham]</a>: So Libby and Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of your experience in this space and whether you feel strongly about what's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=944.112s">[Graham]</a>: Is it too much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=944.712s">[Graham]</a>: Is it not enough, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=949.588s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1037.112s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1037.872s">[Graham]</a>: So if you're signing up for that, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1040.353s">[Graham]</a>: I'll sign up for it with Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1044.654s">[Graham]</a>: And so, Luke, I think as you read this, if there are changes in that vein that paint a bigger picture, I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1053.397s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing I think we can use this document for is when we went to Arlington and we walked around a brand new building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1064.768s">[Graham]</a>: The first thing you saw was like a student-run cafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1070.386s">[Graham]</a>: Nobody in this building is like dreaming about a student-run cafe because it's like beyond the scope of what by and large we know to be about high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1082.796s">[Graham]</a>: Like I didn't have a student-run cafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1085.038s">[Graham]</a>: You didn't have a student-run cafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1086.879s">[Graham]</a>: Those weren't things back when we were kids going to high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1090.141s">[Graham]</a>: And we know what's in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1091.523s">[Graham]</a>: And some people probably know like what those options are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1093.864s">[Graham]</a>: But I think this is also sort of a nice opportunity for us to say to the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1100.149s">[Graham]</a>: here's this big vision, like here's where we're at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1104.63s">[Graham]</a>: And this is the beginning, because I think it could get juices flowing, which will like feed into the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1112.892s">[Graham]</a>: Luke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1197.322s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the other thing that is important to remember is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1202.608s">[Graham]</a>: There's no requirement even that the school building committee is involved in the creation of this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1207.692s">[Graham]</a>: Like the requirement is that it is submitted by the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1211.795s">[Graham]</a>: So I think it's appropriate for this team to start to like paint a picture for people to react to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1218.681s">[Graham]</a>: So I think I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1220.002s">[Graham]</a>: I'm personally okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1222.043s">[Graham]</a>: I think to the point of like engaging the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1227.57s">[Graham]</a>: I do want to engage the community when there's experts in the room who can do that well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1234.992s">[Graham]</a>: I don't want us to be too far out ahead of that process because I think none of us particularly is equipped to do that kind of visioning process with the community in a way that's going to sort of be consistent with what has to happen during feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1251.157s">[Graham]</a>: So I don't want to create a situation where we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1257.452s">[Graham]</a>: sort of out over our skis, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1259.994s">[Graham]</a>: So I think like what I would use this document when we sort of get to the point of publishing this to the community, I mean, they can, it's in the meeting documents and everything, but to say like, this is our, this is like the jumping off point that the committee accelerated to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1277.685s">[Graham]</a>: get us to the place where like the door, we can open the doors to this bigger vision, but we want you to read this and start to think creatively about these spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1287.351s">[Graham]</a>: The important thing is like programming like Curtis Tufts, Curtis Tufts has to sort of say like an enter, this is our, this is like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1295.997s">[Graham]</a>: is, you know, this is our place to, to describe all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1300.86s">[Graham]</a>: So, and start that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1303.362s">[Graham]</a>: So I think I'm okay with us being sort of visionary in terms of what we know, because as MSBA describes the requirement here is like, this is so that we can start to hear what's important to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1315.089s">[Graham]</a>: And I can tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1317.01s">[Graham]</a>: I feel good that the things that we hear about on the school committee all the time are well represented here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1323.832s">[Graham]</a>: Athletics, performing arts, Curtis Tufts, the alternative space for the high school, like all of those things are the, those are the heavy hitter topics for us, generally speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1336.155s">[Graham]</a>: Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1391.817s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, sorry, Larry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1450.438s">[Graham]</a>: The one in Arlington is like a cafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1453.12s">[Graham]</a>: So the one in Arlington is like limited because you can't interfere with the food service program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1459.124s">[Graham]</a>: That's a whole other problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1460.865s">[Graham]</a>: But this what was in Arlington was like a cafe, essentially like coffee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1478.755s">[Graham]</a>: So that's all in the chapter 74 piece in that other form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1483.716s">[Graham]</a>: So it doesn't make a huge appearance here for that reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1493.799s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1494.139s">[Graham]</a>: So we, I did put something in there just so it doesn't get lost, but the chapter 74 form talks about all of those programs that we're trying to explore and the proposed capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1548.013s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1549.034s">[Graham]</a>: I can add something about that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1552.195s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1553.196s">[Graham]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1868.396s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1869.778s">[Graham]</a>: Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1872.38s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2051.956s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the work that the administrative team has signed up to do, because they will have to describe the curriculum, the 2B curriculum section of this, which is not complete yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2261.772s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2262.312s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so I guess a couple things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2265.734s">[Graham]</a>: I am also here to keep this on track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2267.555s">[Graham]</a>: It is like my mission in life to keep this thing on track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2273.198s">[Graham]</a>: One of the things that, so I agree with you that we can start to ask those questions in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2278.9s">[Graham]</a>: What I'm unclear about is, are you saying we should not submit this until we've done that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2283.127s">[Graham]</a>: Or are you suggesting that we submit this and then we use that sort of body of information to also feed the consultants that are going to come on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2318.705s">[Graham]</a>: And so is there something in here that you want to not be in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2348.764s">[Graham]</a>: It is asking for core spaces, specialty spaces, and non-traditional spaces that are described above are proposed to be used if known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2362.253s">[Graham]</a>: Additionally, if there are proposed changes indicate how they will impact space needs and what training to support staff will or may be provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2371.892s">[Graham]</a>: That is the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2398.755s">[Graham]</a>: Bear with me, my brain short-circuited several hours back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2402.998s">[Graham]</a>: Is there something you're proposing to take out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2405.62s">[Graham]</a>: Like, are there words on the page that you want to take out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2408.042s">[Graham]</a>: I would say anything that doesn't exist today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2410.724s">[Graham]</a>: Which is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2427.737s">[Graham]</a>: Anesthesia, like all of these things exist, they just exist poorly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2475.937s">[Graham]</a>: I think what the community wants is to talk in feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2482.439s">[Graham]</a>: And we can't get there unless we agree on how we are going to get this document submitted, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2489.462s">[Graham]</a>: So that is why I'm just trying to be really concrete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2494.053s">[Graham]</a>: that you what I think what you're saying is there's too much information in items one through 11 on page 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2502.16s">[Graham]</a>: And instead, we should maybe be more broad about what we are thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2507.664s">[Graham]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2558.049s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2559.009s">[Graham]</a>: I also would encourage this group to choose their words carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2563.99s">[Graham]</a>: Like if we start telling people we're disenfranchising them, they will feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2568.691s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't think the community thinks of us that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2571.411s">[Graham]</a>: Like, and so we shouldn't talk that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2576.232s">[Graham]</a>: So I just, I think this stuff does find its own legs in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2581.433s">[Graham]</a>: So I, the school committee under its authority<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2588.703s">[Graham]</a>: appointed you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2590.505s">[Graham]</a>: And we're here to like, make sure we don't mess this up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2594.009s">[Graham]</a>: Because everyone in the city is definitely afraid we are going to mess this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2598.814s">[Graham]</a>: So it's just it's the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2602.538s">[Graham]</a>: So we can strike<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2605.183s">[Graham]</a>: item 11, all those other things are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2608.585s">[Graham]</a>: We can make it, like I will go through and make it a little bit less specific, which I think is totally fine and reasonable, so that it does not sound so specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2618.192s">[Graham]</a>: And I think to your point, like when we put out a press release that says these documents are complete, there needs to be some framing of this document as like a starting point by this committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2633.675s">[Graham]</a>: in meetings open to the public, it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2636.656s">[Graham]</a>: It's like May and June, like there's not a whole lot of time in the community for people to be with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2641.677s">[Graham]</a>: But the entire point of this was to like collect all the feedback that we've heard all along the way, pair it up with like the teaching and learning methodology and get us sort of off to the races.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2653.52s">[Graham]</a>: And that, to me, that is what we're here to do in eligibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2658.281s">[Graham]</a>: So I think we're still on track to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2661.962s">[Graham]</a>: And so I think the other place where there is some like real description here is around the library media space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2670.784s">[Graham]</a>: But I would also say, I don't see anything in here that doesn't sort of match the description of current in some way, shape or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2680.167s">[Graham]</a>: So there's some description of like what the current state is that Maria put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2684.328s">[Graham]</a>: And then there is the description of the like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2688.666s">[Graham]</a>: the ideal space and other than a restroom close by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2695.791s">[Graham]</a>: And movable walls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2699.233s">[Graham]</a>: I think other than that, we are fairly saying something about how we're envisioning and actually with the luxury of our head librarian doing that for us, that this is sort of what we're envisioning that space to become.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2715.879s">[Graham]</a>: So that was the other place where I thought it was very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2721.083s">[Graham]</a>: And so I don't know if anybody saw anything else that they thought was maybe too detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2779.902s">[Graham]</a>: That will all be cleaned up before this is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2816.676s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2817.937s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, all of that is a sort of a wacky template to work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2824.182s">[Graham]</a>: And it has like all kinds of different bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2826.304s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that will be cleaned up before we're done to make sure that it's consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2846.236s">[Graham]</a>: That's totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2846.976s">[Graham]</a>: That's totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2862.938s">[Graham]</a>: Are there questions about section three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2867.427s">[Graham]</a>: Aaron?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2895.519s">[Graham]</a>: I think we're just, I think what I'm hearing is to just bring everything up to the same level of detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2901.503s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3042.699s">[Graham]</a>: Yep, and Suzanne was working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3045.96s">[Graham]</a>: Tracking down that application that went in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3049.401s">[Graham]</a>: Some years ago now to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3053.643s">[Graham]</a>: It was very project based learning integration with the outdoors oriented for another grant that we did not get, but she was going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3064.506s">[Graham]</a>: Go through the files and we had information to figure out if there's anything that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3130.114s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3131.034s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3132.794s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3159.237s">[Graham]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3159.618s">[Graham]</a>: Brian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3167.229s">[Graham]</a>: Um so we talked about Arlington, we talked about Somerville, Belmont, okay and you know the other you know the thing we may want to do is sort of reformat our summer meetings to be like tours instead so that we have some time in summer to do various tours so um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3193.241s">[Graham]</a>: I think that would be a great use of summer if we can get all of these documents, if we can get through all of these documents so that we really can sort of take the summer to put all of our like communication plans together, start to tell the community what we're saying, start to look at all those other schools and sort of get ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3210.693s">[Graham]</a>: So it might just be nice timing to do all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3275.683s">[Graham]</a>: Section four, community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3277.204s">[Graham]</a>: I think the last time we talked, people talked about the sequencing of the information in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3288.351s">[Graham]</a>: And I tried to, although I'm finding the typos because I was doing this in my lap at the council meeting last night, but I did try to like re-sequence this to better flow with the information that we have in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3301.748s">[Graham]</a>: So talking about the communications and community engagement subcommittee first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3308.01s">[Graham]</a>: I think it was last and then talking about some of the things specifically that they asked about around, you know, what kinds of things are we considering doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3318.294s">[Graham]</a>: And then, in addition, doing a little bit of sort of just framing that last paragraph a little bit better about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3326.437s">[Graham]</a>: the engagement that we've already done around the co-location of Curtis Tufts because that is a program that we are proposing to bring on here and the school committee has done some very helpful useful work to sort of move that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3338.506s">[Graham]</a>: So that is, I think that is everything in this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3352.415s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3358.724s">[Graham]</a>: Um, is there a motion to approve this document as amended and to be completed as noted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3383.601s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3387.09s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so a motion by Dr. Cushing and Aaron, seconded by Aaron.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3398.273s">[Graham]</a>: All of our voting members are in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3401.354s">[Graham]</a>: So all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3404.715s">[Graham]</a>: All those opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3406.996s">[Graham]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3408.556s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3421.483s">[Graham]</a>: I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3424.444s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, the last item on our agenda for this evening is just to give you an update on the maintenance practices information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3435.428s">[Graham]</a>: So, Dr. Cushing, so let me pass this out and then I'll explain what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3475.134s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, does everyone have a coffee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3476.735s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, we're almost there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3478.975s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3481.236s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so just as framing, the MSBA has an online portal where they require us to upload a whole variety of documents around our maintenance and capital planning practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3496.251s">[Graham]</a>: Earlier in this process, Tom and I sat down with that system and we went through and we created this document to just try to provide like a working place for all of that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3512.425s">[Graham]</a>: So you'll see all the questions listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3517.349s">[Graham]</a>: throughout this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3520.573s">[Graham]</a>: And what you'll see is the questions, the answer format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3524.638s">[Graham]</a>: So many of these things are like yes, no type questions, and then any comments, which would be comments that we need to put into the system to answer the question, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3535.485s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so if we start at the top, what I think you'll see is that the vast majority of this information has to be completed by Dr. Cushing, who's our representative on the committee in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3551.553s">[Graham]</a>: his work as the overseer of the facilities department for Medford Public Schools, among other 45 other jobs that he does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3561.003s">[Graham]</a>: But I think I just wanted to run through the questions here as a sort of jumping off point and talk a little bit about, you know, give you all a chance to review all the information that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3576.447s">[Graham]</a>: is populated in here already and talk about next steps for this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3582.41s">[Graham]</a>: So if we start at the top, the first series of questions is really around staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3586.332s">[Graham]</a>: So it asks about, question number one is, is the facility maintenance performed by the municipality or the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3594.375s">[Graham]</a>: In our situation, it's a combination of both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3597.415s">[Graham]</a>: So the districts largely has the responsibility for sort of all things maintenance until something gets too big and becomes a capital project and then the city does step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3609.585s">[Graham]</a>: Our buildings and grounds department clears snow and they do other projects like paving and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3615.851s">[Graham]</a>: So it is truly a group effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3618.469s">[Graham]</a>: Item number two, are vendors used for any aspect of facilities maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3622.771s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer to that is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3624.953s">[Graham]</a>: For all of these things, plumbing, pest management, elevator inspections, asbestos testing, et cetera, fire alarm systems, all of that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3639.06s">[Graham]</a>: Number three, full-time equivalent, to help them understand how many custodians we have across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3648.73s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a director of facilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3650.131s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to that is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3651.833s">[Graham]</a>: And does the district have defined job descriptions for our custodial staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3657.218s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer is yes, so we'll have to attach those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3660.78s">[Graham]</a>: Um, item number six is their system of performance evaluations of the district's custodial and maintenance staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3667.665s">[Graham]</a>: Um, that is a work in progress, but, uh, we are, uh, pending contract negotiations around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3677.071s">[Graham]</a>: And, um, number seven is training required or provided for the district's custodial and maintenance staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3682.675s">[Graham]</a>: Um, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3683.456s">[Graham]</a>: And we cover some of the things that we have, um, trained our staff in starting in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3690.656s">[Graham]</a>: And then number eight is their written maintenance plan for the district that details minimum custodial maintenance standards and governs day to day operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3699.861s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to that is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3701.822s">[Graham]</a>: And so we will have to attach those documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3703.923s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the staffing section, the planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3708.354s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a preventive or predictive maintenance plan for the district's facilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3713.019s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to that is yes, and there's an attachment that we'll have to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3718.225s">[Graham]</a>: Does the district have a work order system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3720.187s">[Graham]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3721.248s">[Graham]</a>: We actually recently converted from email work order system, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3727.458s">[Graham]</a>: problematic, as you might mention, to a system called operations hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3734.484s">[Graham]</a>: And it is a true work order ticketing system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3737.707s">[Graham]</a>: And we the district is sort of rolling folks onto that both on the custodial staff and then also in the school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3745.993s">[Graham]</a>: Over the course, there's working on that implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3749.736s">[Graham]</a>: The facilities condition index<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3752.751s">[Graham]</a>: question number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3753.411s">[Graham]</a>: Does the district conduct periodic inspections of school facilities to ascertain their conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3757.874s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to that is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3759.956s">[Graham]</a>: Um, item number two is do we have a facilities condition index which keeps track of school systems, identifies major system components and tracks information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3773.084s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we purchased some software to begin doing that in February of 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3776.947s">[Graham]</a>: That's operation hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3777.808s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3782.066s">[Graham]</a>: item number three, please describe how the district analyzes facility condition information and how that analysis impacts decisions on budget capital improvements and staff performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3792.819s">[Graham]</a>: So up until recently, the facility conditions and repairs were done on an as-needed basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3801.229s">[Graham]</a>: the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3803.47s">[Graham]</a>: So beginning in FY 24, we've really begun to shift to a recommissioning model where we are looking at each of our schools on a periodic basis to understand their budgetary needs, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3816.876s">[Graham]</a>: Item number four,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3818.637s">[Graham]</a>: is do we have a protocol around commissioning and recommissioning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3822.42s">[Graham]</a>: That is starting in FY25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3826.162s">[Graham]</a>: And that process is essentially on a periodic basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3830.385s">[Graham]</a>: You do sort of a soup to nuts assessment of what is happening in the building so that you can identify what it would take to bring the building back to its original condition in terms of its intention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3841.632s">[Graham]</a>: And then what that does is it sort of highlights any maintenance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3846.515s">[Graham]</a>: practices that need to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3848.977s">[Graham]</a>: HVAC can, you know, the big systems there are like HVAC oriented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3853.621s">[Graham]</a>: You may or may not know this, but we have a project going on right now in our middle schools that will replace HVAC systems in the Andrews Middle School and then in the entire McGlynn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3863.788s">[Graham]</a>: So those buildings are like in effect being reconditioned because of that substantive work, which is scheduled to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3872.294s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully by next summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3873.816s">[Graham]</a>: Next summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3874.336s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3876.605s">[Graham]</a>: And the other schools, Brooks, Roberts, Missittuck, will get on to the reconditioning cycle with this next rehab.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3885.929s">[Graham]</a>: And then the expectation would be the high school would go on to like a five-year loop with the other schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3977.055s">[Graham]</a>: So, so yes, yes to both of those things right like proactive maintenance like extends the life of these systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3986.482s">[Graham]</a>: But there is a life of the system that you know you you tap out and I think what you see, particularly when you talk when you start to think about like that's kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=3997.179s">[Graham]</a>: system programming that's going to go into this new high school like Arlington talked a lot about how like they don't know how to use their building just yet because it is so highly technical and so very different than how their building used to operate that they said often they hear they are like this thing is broken and it's not broken at all they just don't know how to use it yet right and so there's this huge learning curve that goes into these these new buildings in particular<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4024.927s">[Graham]</a>: But, you know, for the same reason that like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4028.106s">[Graham]</a>: when your car is like fully electrified inside, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4032.429s">[Graham]</a>: Like there's more parts, there's more things that can go wrong, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4037.073s">[Graham]</a>: There's more, there's more, well, if you're completely electric, that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4041.196s">[Graham]</a>: But like you start talking about like even the advancement of anything else that's going on in your home, like you're, you know, the refrigerator from the 70s lasted for 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4051.623s">[Graham]</a>: And it's still, maybe it's still running in avocado green, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4055.816s">[Graham]</a>: If you buy a refrigerator 10 years ago, you're probably thinking about it's time for a new refrigerator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4061.978s">[Graham]</a>: So the entire way we maintain our buildings will change with this new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4068.039s">[Graham]</a>: And I think what they're trying to understand is, how do we do it today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4072.1s">[Graham]</a>: So how big of a climb is this going to be for us to take good care of this building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4077.181s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer is, we have work to do in that department, for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4083.363s">[Graham]</a>: we are trying to get there proactively so that we have arrived by the time this building comes on because that's going to be its own challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4093.549s">[Graham]</a>: The environment question, does the district routinely monitor air quality?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4098.672s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to that is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4101.594s">[Graham]</a>: Does the district implement practices in the EPA's Tools for Schools program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4106.537s">[Graham]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4114.18s">[Graham]</a>: Does the district have a protocol to eliminate toxic chemicals and use green products for cleaning and repairs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4121.205s">[Graham]</a>: Best practices for building operators typically include regular inspecting, testing, balancing, and cleaning of HVAC components in order to make them most efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4128.891s">[Graham]</a>: Do we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4130.672s">[Graham]</a>: I think that's like maybe a working yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4134.655s">[Graham]</a>: Does the district monitor energy consumption and spending?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4137.537s">[Graham]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4143.081s">[Graham]</a>: It is a very interesting analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4168.462s">[Graham]</a>: With outside testing, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4459.45s">[Graham]</a>: We have a maintenance department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4465.941s">[Graham]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4591.494s">[Graham]</a>: Well, you know, you're being recorded, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4602.837s">[Graham]</a>: Also in this document is a series of questions about budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4607.639s">[Graham]</a>: So does the facility maintenance person have a role in establishing the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4611.981s">[Graham]</a>: What are the amounts that have been requested in the budget over a series of years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4618.103s">[Graham]</a>: What was allocated in the budget over a series of years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4621.244s">[Graham]</a>: If there is a variance, why was there a variance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4625.426s">[Graham]</a>: Expended budget over a series of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4632.196s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a variance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4633.998s">[Graham]</a>: If there's a variance of 20% or greater between consecutive years and the district's total expended amounts, please provide the details on the reason for the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4642.02s">[Graham]</a>: projected budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4643.601s">[Graham]</a>: I think we're actually on a better track there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4645.581s">[Graham]</a>: So that is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4647.582s">[Graham]</a>: What does the district believe that the appropriate amount of spending on operations and maintenance should be to allow for routine maintenance of those facilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4656.104s">[Graham]</a>: And how close are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4657.165s">[Graham]</a>: So we had lots of conversation at the council meeting last night, in particular, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4666.801s">[Graham]</a>: that there are potential Proposition 2.5 overrides on the ballot in November, voted in last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4677.303s">[Graham]</a>: And part of all of that money, $7.5 million across the two ballot measures, other than $500,000, would be directed towards schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4688.189s">[Graham]</a>: A big part of the planning that went into those numbers was things like making sure that we're able to provide routine maintenance that supports the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4697.013s">[Graham]</a>: So that's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4698.721s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then any other comments on your budget history, so we will talk about those upcoming items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4705.384s">[Graham]</a>: Then there's a capital program piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4707.845s">[Graham]</a>: We're in good shape from a capital program perspective because the city, we had a capital program for several years when Mayor Lungo Kern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4716.613s">[Graham]</a>: took the reins of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4718.135s">[Graham]</a>: She created an integrated capital plan that included the schools and they use the calling center to help establish that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4728.185s">[Graham]</a>: And then we are in the midst of a policy change on the school committee side to sort of codify our annual capital planning review process for schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4739.897s">[Graham]</a>: And then the capital budget history asks about tax overrides, capital exclusions, debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4747.401s">[Graham]</a>: The answer to all of those is we have not done that before, but we're about to do it in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4753.404s">[Graham]</a>: And then any other capital projects that were deferred due to funding constraints, so I'm sure that we will have one or two items in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4763.002s">[Graham]</a>: The final section is the capital improvement plan and budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4767.404s">[Graham]</a>: So what is you know what is our capital improvement plan and budget so we will attach the city's capital improvement plan and some of the other documents that we have internally and then provide any information about availability of non public funds for school facility purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4782.51s">[Graham]</a>: We'll talk about our rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4784.621s">[Graham]</a>: and some other things there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4786.923s">[Graham]</a>: And then provide information from the treasurer finance committee or capital planning committee regarding the outstanding debt and future bond capacity inside the debt limit for municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4796.93s">[Graham]</a>: And so that will come from the bankers office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4800.727s">[Graham]</a>: And then this last table was just a table, one of the tables that have to be sort of filled out and completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4807.089s">[Graham]</a>: So all this document is really just to allow us to start to collect the information where that ultimately then has to be like keyed into the system in a very particular way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4819.654s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to share this with you, find out if you have questions or comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4825.126s">[Graham]</a>: Our working goal is again that by June 30th this will be done and we will be able to submit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4832.474s">[Graham]</a>: We actually have until I think October to do this, but we can't go to that next phase in the process until we're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4837.899s">[Graham]</a>: So our goal is to get all of this documentation pulled together and buttoned up between now and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4844.065s">[Graham]</a>: So questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4849.193s">[Graham]</a>: Um, would anybody like to make a motion to authorize Dr. Cushing and I to complete and submit the questionnaire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4862.561s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so motion for myself and Dr. Cushing to complete this questionnaire as requested by Nicole Morrell, seconded by Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4875.509s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4879.639s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4881.883s">[Graham]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4882.565s">[Graham]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4884.588s">[Graham]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4885.15s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4891.28s">[Graham]</a>: We are at the end of our agenda, a few minutes early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4895.122s">[Graham]</a>: Our next full meeting is scheduled at six o'clock on July 17th via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4901.006s">[Graham]</a>: I will be in touch with the communications committee so that we can find another date hopefully in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4906.109s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the next steps are to finish up these forms and get everything submitted and look forward to that feasibility study vote by the council on the 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4919.297s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so that we are sort of off to the races and then, you know, use the summer to do our community engagement planning and do some touring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4930.205s">[Graham]</a>: So between now and July 1st, I'm going to say I will be back in touch with you if I am able to sort of shift things around and schedule some dates and times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4939.432s">[Graham]</a>: So those two meetings may not stay on the calendar exactly as they are, but I will let you know as soon as I have ideas and plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4948.482s">[Graham]</a>: Generally speaking, if we're going to go to a school in the summer, I think their folks are going to lean toward wanting to host us, not in the evenings, is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4963.322s">[Graham]</a>: time frame that works better for you all than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4968.527s">[Graham]</a>: I'm assuming it's summer, it's going to be sort of a Monday to Friday ish thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4973.853s">[Graham]</a>: And probably they're going to ask for us not to come from six to eight, but I will certainly ask if that's a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4980.359s">[Graham]</a>: So is there other other times like, generally speaking that like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4985.834s">[Graham]</a>: Is morning better than afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4987.275s">[Graham]</a>: Is afternoon better than lunchtime?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4988.976s">[Graham]</a>: Is lunchtime the best?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4991.037s">[Graham]</a>: Any feedback about scheduling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4992.658s">[Graham]</a>: I know it's all impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4995.8s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5028.193s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5030.316s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5031.577s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments about timing and scheduling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5036.702s">[Graham]</a>: I know it's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5038.128s">[Graham]</a>: So like I said, I will ask if there are people willing to host us on an evening, and maybe there's evening programming going on in the building where somebody would be willing to do that, or the architects would be willing, the designers often are willing to sort of help make those things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5052.933s">[Graham]</a>: So I will do some outreach and be in touch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5057.835s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sure the HMFH would be very happy to take a group back to Arlington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5063.377s">[Graham]</a>: I know some of you got to see Arlington,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5066.438s">[Graham]</a>: It was just right next door, which is amazing and was very cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5070.839s">[Graham]</a>: So I will be in touch on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5073.84s">[Graham]</a>: And as soon as I have dates, I will have Lisa send them out to you all so that you have them on your calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5079.141s">[Graham]</a>: And you all should have district email now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5083.342s">[Graham]</a>: If you have questions about that, you can see Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5088.463s">[Graham]</a>: And is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5091.824s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Luke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5095.437s">[Graham]</a>: by Libby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5097.106s">[Graham]</a>: All those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=5097.91s">[Graham]</a>: All those opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1145.778s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve the Medford Educational Administrative Assistant's AFSCME 93 contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1206.173s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1208.416s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2256.018s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2258.701s">[Graham]</a>: I just wanted to talk about what we have done in the past from a process perspective, since we have so many new members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2268.277s">[Graham]</a>: just to sort of get the ball rolling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2270.958s">[Graham]</a>: So this is the superintendent self-evaluation, and then we as a committee have to compile our evaluation and then present it back in an open session just like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2283.665s">[Graham]</a>: But what we did last year that seemed to work was that the evaluation subcommittee met, had a meeting, established a timeline,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2293.65s">[Graham]</a>: of all the steps that had to happen from our perspective, and then held a separate, a second meeting where they compiled the results from all the different pieces of evaluation from each of us individually, and then that came to the floor to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2312.674s">[Graham]</a>: to be reviewed here and presented and ultimately approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2318.477s">[Graham]</a>: So I think those are the next steps is for that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2322.039s">[Graham]</a>: And I think member Olopade chairs that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2324.92s">[Graham]</a>: So I think the next steps would be for you all to find a time to meet and establish the right timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2331.084s">[Graham]</a>: And we can dig up and obviously support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2335.646s">[Graham]</a>: with the process because I think everyone on the committee is new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2338.908s">[Graham]</a>: So we can definitely give you some process like guidance along the way in terms of what needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2349.414s">[Graham]</a>: But I think the most important thing for all the members to know is that everything that we do here as part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2358.069s">[Graham]</a>: compiling the superintendent's evaluation is a matter of public record and must be done on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2364.935s">[Graham]</a>: This is not stuff that happens in executive session, which.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2368.846s">[Graham]</a>: is the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2369.947s">[Graham]</a>: It's not, would not be my preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2371.929s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sure it would not be the superintendent's preference, but there are unfortunately like there, that is the process that we have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2379.455s">[Graham]</a>: So all of your subcommittee meetings will be held as hosted subcommittee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2385.12s">[Graham]</a>: Members of the public are free to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2388.243s">[Graham]</a>: And the sort of mechanics of how you compile all have to be done in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2393.867s">[Graham]</a>: in open session, so I just wanted to put that out there because there are some next steps there, and I just wanted to make sure that if there are questions about that, we give folks an opportunity to ask some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4286.442s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4287.283s">[Graham]</a>: Um, does I think this is a question for Miss Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4293.329s">[Graham]</a>: What kind of supports does city air provide to its staff, given that that stipend would not allow you to live in the area, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4302.898s">[Graham]</a>: So that is not enough money to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4306.872s">[Graham]</a>: pay rent, eat, do all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4309.016s">[Graham]</a>: Are there other supports that you're providing to the team so that they can actually live in the area that they are working in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4390.9s">[Graham]</a>: And then I think this question is maybe for the superintendent, in terms of like how you envision these teams being used, I guess like the things that I started thinking about immediately are some of our operational challenges around substitute coverage around after school, but it sounds like substitute coverage is not an option in terms of how they work with our, with our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4412.64s">[Graham]</a>: So would these students, like if they're in the classroom working with teachers, I think the question about union work is a good one to be asking to make sure that we're not tripping on our bargaining obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4430.665s">[Graham]</a>: But also if we were to try to think about like the afterschool challenge of capacity in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4439.827s">[Graham]</a>: some of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4440.807s">[Graham]</a>: I know Brooks is sort of an anomaly because the program is too big for the building, but at Missittuck and McGlynn and Roberts for sure, there is some capacity, I think, to expand the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4453.592s">[Graham]</a>: Would these staff being infused into the afterschool program allow us to take more students into the program that Megan runs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4563.703s">[Graham]</a>: And so tactically, do you have a number of people that we could take off the wait list and place into the program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4640.967s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I think I would definitely be interested in knowing how do we quantify that because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4647.327s">[Graham]</a>: that's an important and ongoing discussion that we're sort of always having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4651.45s">[Graham]</a>: And we have wait lists in all the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4653.172s">[Graham]</a>: So if there is like a quantifiable way to say what we would be able to do, that would, I think, be ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4661.118s">[Graham]</a>: The other question I have is about the work that they're doing in collaboration with a teacher in a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4667.964s">[Graham]</a>: How are they trained on the curricula that our teachers are using?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4671.647s">[Graham]</a>: So I know we have been like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4674.409s">[Graham]</a>: sort of fighting the good fight around the science of reading and using evidence-based instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4680.914s">[Graham]</a>: And I am a little nervous about tutors in the mix who may not be apprised of all of those things that our teachers are sort of on the front lines of every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4696.307s">[Graham]</a>: So I was just curious, and maybe that's a question for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4699.149s">[Graham]</a>: Roberts, how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5922.997s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5924.098s">[Graham]</a>: Miss Roberts, I respect the fact that there's a lot of questions that we've posed that are not for you to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5931.482s">[Graham]</a>: And that's sort of always the case with these kinds of sort of big strategic efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5939.567s">[Graham]</a>: And I wondered if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5943.055s">[Graham]</a>: we could plan to have a follow-up meeting, perhaps the week of July 8th, to be able to provide you a final answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5950.459s">[Graham]</a>: One of the things that I am thinking about is that we also have, due at some point, a report back from Meghan Fidler Carey about any ways in which the administration has come up with any expansion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5966.787s">[Graham]</a>: And we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5968.748s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about things like using the Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5971.631s">[Graham]</a>: We've talked about a whole bunch of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5973.433s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wonder if given like if we could just get by ourselves a couple of weeks, could we put together like a cohesive plan about how this could work effectively here in our district that would be compelling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5989.708s">[Graham]</a>: And with the framing of it all as sort of supplementing the afterschool staff as its primary mission, which I think is sort of the thing we're all coalescing around, the revolving fund account for the afterschool program could be relied on to pay for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6007.899s">[Graham]</a>: So the budget concerns that my colleagues have, which are well-founded, are separate concerns when you're talking about a revolving account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6017.665s">[Graham]</a>: So I just, I guess my roundabout ask is maybe twofold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6022.206s">[Graham]</a>: One, could we get back to you in a couple of weeks so that we can do a little bit of due diligence planning on our end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6028.987s">[Graham]</a>: And two, superintendent, could we schedule a meeting for the week of the eighth where we circle back, close that open loop about afterschool programming with this in mind and say, this is sort of, what does this look like as part of that solution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6185.854s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, your point about these folks needing to find housing in our housing market is a really good one, actually, because it is really hard everywhere, and Medford is not an exception to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6201.112s">[Graham]</a>: You know, I, I don't know, you know where the rest of the committee is at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6205.315s">[Graham]</a>: I think if we could, I don't know if maybe we try to approve this tonight with an expectation that some sort of report can be provided to us in the next couple of weeks that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6219.206s">[Graham]</a>: sort of answers some of these questions that has been posed just so that we have sort of a closed loop process and then we can we can and still I think should have our meeting about broadly what happens with after school but it would sort of take that contingency out of the mix for Miss Roberts and and the staff that we would want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6240.556s">[Graham]</a>: So I don't know if maybe that's an option where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6243.177s">[Graham]</a>: We approve this tonight, and we still schedule that after school meeting sometime in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6249.64s">[Graham]</a>: That sort of takes the timing pressure off, but allows us to sort of onboard this pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6257.244s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm open to feedback on that idea, and I'm happy to make a motion, but thoughts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6407.356s">[Graham]</a>: So then I will make a motion to approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6410.867s">[Graham]</a>: the two teams as discussed for Magdalene and Misituk, and that we'll have a summer meeting about resuming our conversation around afterschool programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6636.15s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6783.171s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you to Dr Cushing because we have been having this conversation in negotiations about exactly how this will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6792.999s">[Graham]</a>: And just last week, one of our bargaining partners was describing that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6798.263s">[Graham]</a>: this exact system is what they wanted to see us implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6801.804s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you for not being in the room, but knowing what that was and making it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6806.766s">[Graham]</a>: So appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6809.427s">[Graham]</a>: And I think, you know, the direct connection to frontline is critically important to streamlining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6817.169s">[Graham]</a>: how we pay our staff, how we ensure that we're paying people for overtime in accordance with the contract and the law and all of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6826.991s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you for all of that, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6837.393s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6861.809s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to take 2024 dash 30 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7313.936s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, and I sort of am feeling like, so two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7321.819s">[Graham]</a>: One is I'm in favor of having these discussions because I think to your point about the opportunities that having some additional support might provide is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7331.962s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm sort of inclined to say what I'd like to see us do is adopt the statute, which we have to do in order for any of this to be legally possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7343.185s">[Graham]</a>: but also adopt the statute with an amendment that states that before any sort of change happens, that that plan will be presented to us for review and approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7358.812s">[Graham]</a>: And the reason I say that is because there's any number of ways where this, like, I think we've just talked about like five of them literally in a minute, that this could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7367.374s">[Graham]</a>: It could just simply be support and then everybody still reports to the superintendent and the school committee still holds the contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7374.856s">[Graham]</a>: It could be that the contracts go somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7377.437s">[Graham]</a>: It could, you know, any number of things could happen in any of these departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7380.678s">[Graham]</a>: So what I would like to see is that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7385.484s">[Graham]</a>: we agree that we should investigate what these options are and bring those proposals back to this group before those actions are taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7407.401s">[Graham]</a>: So we don't usually do B papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7410.603s">[Graham]</a>: So do I make a motion to like approve the paper and then somebody else adds a B paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7416.785s">[Graham]</a>: Is that how it happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7418.646s">[Graham]</a>: You could do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7419.227s">[Graham]</a>: You could do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7419.867s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7427.45s">[Graham]</a>: What I'm saying is we would be accepting the statute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7432.681s">[Graham]</a>: So we would make a motion to accept the statute, which has to happen in order for the statute to be accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7438.285s">[Graham]</a>: And then there would be a B paper added that is a motion that requires school committee approval before any plan is implemented for shared resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7449.293s">[Graham]</a>: So what we would be doing tonight would simply be opening the door to have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7470.788s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo, do you need me to repeat that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7485.247s">[Graham]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7485.407s">[Graham]</a>: Two motions of main paper and then the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7490.709s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7591.341s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7627.553s">[Graham]</a>: Hold on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7629.377s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7632.258s">[Graham]</a>: There's a recommendation to approve the FY 25 Medford Public Schools operating budget by Mr. Jerry McHugh, Director of Finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7639.041s">[Graham]</a>: So the mayor is abstaining from this vote entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7641.922s">[Graham]</a>: Member Brantley, did you have a conflict you want to cite so that we know what we need to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7662.877s">[Graham]</a>: When the time comes, we will, um, take that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7666.2s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, thank you, Mr McHugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7669.002s">[Graham]</a>: The floor is yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7891.394s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7893.358s">[Graham]</a>: For the committee, are there any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7898.427s">[Graham]</a>: Member Lapate and then member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8103.294s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, number and tapa you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8253.82s">[Graham]</a>: And thank you, Member Ntapa, and I think that's an important clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8258.944s">[Graham]</a>: My understanding, though, is that for the administrators unit, one of the positions that was cut, that individual actually has accepted another position in the district, so she is remaining with the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8273.455s">[Graham]</a>: And then my understanding of the performing arts position is that the individual in that role has resigned, so the position is open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8284.081s">[Graham]</a>: And so I would like somebody, maybe Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8286.302s">[Graham]</a>: Glucy, Dr. Glucy, to describe the vision for supporting performing arts under this new structure if this budget passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8403.274s">[Graham]</a>: I hope that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8404.835s">[Graham]</a>: That is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8405.855s">[Graham]</a>: Will this be a promotion for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8410.157s">[Graham]</a>: Fee with taking on the extra department or does this all fall under her current director one job description?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8426.803s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, thank you for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8430.484s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8541.79s">[Graham]</a>: So a motion to receive a report by December 7th that specifically accounts for what has transpired, where any position reductions are maintained in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8557.187s">[Graham]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8582.916s">[Graham]</a>: You could send it to Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8584.296s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8585.356s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeld, is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8589.082s">[Graham]</a>: second by Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8592.804s">[Graham]</a>: Let's sort of pause game and take this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8597.586s">[Graham]</a>: I tell that to my kids when I want them to do the laundry or really anything else in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8601.628s">[Graham]</a>: So on the motion by Member Reinfeldt, which was seconded by Member Rousseau to receive a report by December 7th about these position reductions and the implementation, Member Rousseau, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8617.817s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8619.864s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8632.835s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8636.858s">[Graham]</a>: I'm just looking, yes, you can mark her absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8639.68s">[Graham]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8644.178s">[Graham]</a>: Five in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8647.02s">[Graham]</a>: No, six in the affirmative, one absent, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8650.482s">[Graham]</a>: The motion is approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8652.984s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo, you had your hand in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8655.045s">[Graham]</a>: Actually, Member Reinfeld, are you done with your questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8660.229s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8661.37s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8927.141s">[Graham]</a>: members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8927.441s">[Graham]</a>: So if I can, um, offer a point of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8931.222s">[Graham]</a>: Clarification real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8933.183s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the does this have to do, uh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8937.925s">[Graham]</a>: Mr McHugh with the kindergarten teachers because there were four kindergarten teachers added to the budget after it was approved last year, so it doesn't look like a budget cut because they never were in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9498.467s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9650.085s">[Graham]</a>: Other questions from the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9712.904s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9713.464s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9824.783s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9828.667s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau, can you repeat it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9868.245s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9868.645s">[Graham]</a>: Member Ntapa, did you have a question about the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9902.787s">[Graham]</a>: But to your, I think to the spirit of what you were trying to do, Member Ntapa, one of the things like on my personal list, if we are to see a successful override in November is to get back to addressing those stipends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9921.281s">[Graham]</a>: I know there have been some joint labor discussions with the teachers union about those stipends, which obviously has stalled because there has been no money in the budget to really think through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9933.911s">[Graham]</a>: But in terms of like sort of how like how did we create the the number is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9940.476s">[Graham]</a>: a complex question in terms of where those override numbers came from, but very much on my mind were a number of things, including the stipend district-wide, not just for the band, but for all of our athletic coaches, for all of our after-school, all of our advisors, and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9960.448s">[Graham]</a>: So it's sort of a packaged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9962.529s">[Graham]</a>: deal that when you think about all of those stipends together, it is not a few thousand dollars that needs to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9969.053s">[Graham]</a>: It's quite significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9970.254s">[Graham]</a>: So, I am hopeful that with a successful two override votes in November that we will have some breathing room to be able to get back to that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9979.739s">[Graham]</a>: So, I'll see you at the doors convincing people of that with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10010.28s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, Member Rousseau, can you read the amended motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10048.24s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, on the motion by Member Russo, seconded by Member Rheinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10051.943s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10072.953s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10076.697s">[Graham]</a>: So six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion is approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10082.243s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you all for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10083.444s">[Graham]</a>: And I have taken notes on my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10087.202s">[Graham]</a>: tasks going forward, and we will hopefully report back with something successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10092.405s">[Graham]</a>: Before, I do want to ask if there are members on Zoom who would like to provide comment, but before we do that, I just had a couple of things I wanted to say and clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10107.154s">[Graham]</a>: That I think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10108.896s">[Graham]</a>: So this budget does tell a really nice story about how we got here over the course of many meetings through open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10119.927s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you for that, Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10123.191s">[Graham]</a>: This also does reflect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10126.534s">[Graham]</a>: a lot of what I call budget cleanups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10129.037s">[Graham]</a>: So one of the things that does get complicated in future years when you come back and look at this budget, you're like, why did that change so substantially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10140.489s">[Graham]</a>: And so maybe there is a need to put an asterisk in the budget that says like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10145.154s">[Graham]</a>: There was sort of cleanup of accounts and movement and reclassifications that happen, which mean which the consequences like some of these accounts look like they either artificially inflated or deflated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10158.486s">[Graham]</a>: When in fact, that's really was just a reflection of reclassifying positions into the right places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10166.849s">[Graham]</a>: I also thought the format was very digestible, and I appreciated completely that we didn't kill nearly as many trees in the printing of this budget as we do on the regular when we print budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10180.878s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that I thought was really compelling, and I just wanted to say thank you for it, was the charts at the front that really clearly describe, like, what are our enrollments in each school and in each grades?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10193.766s">[Graham]</a>: how does the staff that supports the building lay out in the in the various buildings and so if you look at you know what happens on page four and what happens on page five you have a really clear picture of how many students are in this building and you have a really clear picture of like and what staff is there to support them so I think that's something that's been very missing from our budgets for a really long time so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10218.109s">[Graham]</a>: I am really happy with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10219.771s">[Graham]</a>: I love the new format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10222.114s">[Graham]</a>: It didn't take me like 17 years to read the budget and get ready for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10226.579s">[Graham]</a>: And because it sort of provided that narrative that you just have to sort of sleuth together yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10232.626s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10233.927s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10235.889s">[Graham]</a>: And I will say, just to sort of quickly recap for people who are on the call and listening, under the citywide budget ordinance, the process kicked off for us in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10253.998s">[Graham]</a>: And in March, the mayor is required under the ordinance to provide an initial allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10259.94s">[Graham]</a>: And when she did at that time, it was 73.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10264.102s">[Graham]</a>: We then, Jerry and team and the superintendent then got to work to sort of try to sort of land somewhere in hybrid territory of like not just what do we need, but like how can we put how could we possibly get to that number because this ramp off of Essar is significant and important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10285.658s">[Graham]</a>: In the end, the work of the mayor with the approval of the city council brought our budget to $77.75 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10293.784s">[Graham]</a>: So that's like a multi-million dollar increase over the initial allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10297.847s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that's a really important point that we have avoided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10304.051s">[Graham]</a>: cuts that we hadn't even yet brought ourselves to discuss because we were able to the city was able to find some additional funding for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10313.239s">[Graham]</a>: And that's that is super important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10315.721s">[Graham]</a>: This budget is not a level service budget because there are still cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10320.104s">[Graham]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10321.906s">[Graham]</a>: This budget also does not do that many new things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10325.869s">[Graham]</a>: So there are some new things that are happening administratively in terms of properly funding accounts that were underfunded before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10332.134s">[Graham]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10333.195s">[Graham]</a>: There are things happening that I think are really important that are new, but in terms of like new programs that you would be able to see or sort of feel in the schools, there's, there's not much in the way of new programming planned under this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10351.848s">[Graham]</a>: better days ahead on that front as well as we look forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10355.57s">[Graham]</a>: So I am gonna ask if there's anyone who would like to provide comment, please just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10365.934s">[Graham]</a>: I'm gonna ask you to limit your comments to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10370.935s">[Graham]</a>: And if you could start by giving us your name and address for the record, that would be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10376.157s">[Graham]</a>: So if there is anybody who would like to provide comment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10380.759s">[Graham]</a>: Please put your hand in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10400.527s">[Graham]</a>: Jessica Healy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10422.643s">[Graham]</a>: Superintendent, can you answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10424.464s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a sixth grade special ed teacher at the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10427.865s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if you can do that one off the top of your head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10494.053s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10495.635s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10496.095s">[Graham]</a>: Bowen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10501.781s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10505.524s">[Graham]</a>: Lily Scott?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10564.309s">[Graham]</a>: Um Lily, I can maybe take a shot at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10566.65s">[Graham]</a>: So there while there were, um, there's a net reduction of three positions in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10574.514s">[Graham]</a>: Um and that includes increases in some places and decreases in other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10579.736s">[Graham]</a>: So the net reduction is three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10582.417s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but that there are additions in various places and, um and offsetting reductions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10590.101s">[Graham]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10591.789s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, the picture is very complicated, but if you saw the superintendent's memo, I think from Friday night, after the table, there's a good explanation of the reductions happening across the district, but I don't, I can't remember off the top of my head if the additions were focused on there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10610.525s">[Graham]</a>: So you'd have to sort of use the chart and the description to net that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10617.331s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10628.884s">[Graham]</a>: Um, for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10631.885s">[Graham]</a>: Is there, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11066.522s">[Graham]</a>: The subcommittee will create four lists of projects, capital projects eligible for Community Preservation Act funding, capital projects eligible for net school spending, capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, and D, all capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11082.196s">[Graham]</a>: The subcommittee will prioritize the individual items within each list, and the school committee will forward these artifacts to the committee per phase three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11090.034s">[Graham]</a>: In phase three, the committee of the whole review and approval will occur between December 1st and December 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11096.98s">[Graham]</a>: The committee will review the projects received from phase two, and the committee will report a capital improvement plan to the next regular school committee meeting for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11107.849s">[Graham]</a>: Phase four, school committee approval of the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11113.454s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, give me just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11114.715s">[Graham]</a>: My computer's gonna die here if I don't plug in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11116.896s">[Graham]</a>: I'm gonna lose you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11120.911s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11122.713s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11124.975s">[Graham]</a>: So the school committee approval of the capital improvement plan and phase four target dates January one to January 31, the school committee will consider approval of the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11134.795s">[Graham]</a>: In phase five, the capital improvement plan will be submitted to the city council, target date January 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11140.359s">[Graham]</a>: The approved school committee capital plan will be forwarded to the city of Medford with a funding request to implement the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11146.624s">[Graham]</a>: Phase six is a publication of the capital improvement plan, which has a target date of February 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11153.809s">[Graham]</a>: The capital improvement plan will be published in the school committee section of the Medford Public Schools website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11161.474s">[Graham]</a>: And...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11164.33s">[Graham]</a>: Phase seven is inclusion of capital projects eligible for net school spending in the budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11170.413s">[Graham]</a>: Target date, February 1st to February 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11173.835s">[Graham]</a>: All capital projects eligible for net school spending that could be reasonably accomplished within the upcoming fiscal year will be incorporated into the budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11180.739s">[Graham]</a>: All capital projects eligible for net school spending but not included in the budget request will be detailed in the budget request as an attachment and explain why all the projects cannot be reasonably accomplished in the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11192.745s">[Graham]</a>: And then phase eight, public school administration submits Community Preservation Committee grant applications with a target date of July 1 to July 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11201.616s">[Graham]</a>: The grant applications eligible for the Community Preservation Act funding shall be submitted to the Community Preservation Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11211.561s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a couple of definitions here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11214.605s">[Graham]</a>: One is a definition of the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11216.687s">[Graham]</a>: The capital improvement plan typically consists of one or more capital improvement projects which are financed through a capital budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11222.713s">[Graham]</a>: CIPs are important tools for local governments, allowing them to plan strategically for community growth and transformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11228.633s">[Graham]</a>: A capital improvement project is an asset upgrade or large scale maintenance work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11233.201s">[Graham]</a>: Some examples of capital projects include building a new school, replacing outdated HVAC systems, replacing a roof, or any project above $150,000 per school building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11242.83s">[Graham]</a>: The Community Preservation Act is a Massachusetts law passed in 2000, enabling communities to assess a tax on real property for open space protection, historic preservation, affordable housing and outdoor recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11256.558s">[Graham]</a>: The Community Preservation Committee is a committee established by the city council here in Medford to make recommendations for spending of community preservation funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11266.504s">[Graham]</a>: And the Community Preservation Fund is a city established fund to contain the monies raised from taxes for the spending of those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11273.491s">[Graham]</a>: and then net school spending all funds expended by the school committee via the budget grants or other funds, as well as certain city expenditures such as infrastructure and pensions, excluding certain types of expenditures such as transportation, adult education, and long-term debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11289.905s">[Graham]</a>: So that is the proposed policy that would line up well with the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11298.628s">[Graham]</a>: policy that we passed around our budget process just a week ago, I believe, or two weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11306.158s">[Graham]</a>: Members, so is there anything else you'd like to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11353.219s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11359.062s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, you're on mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11541.531s">[Graham]</a>: So this is a policy which requires two readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11547.757s">[Graham]</a>: So somebody can make a motion to approve the first reading and then this would go on the agenda again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11553.622s">[Graham]</a>: Alternatively, somebody can motion to waive the first reading and then we can motion to approve the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11580.145s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so there's a motion to waive the first reading by member Labate, yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11597.554s">[Graham]</a>: The whole extra line break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=251.092s">[Graham]</a>: Aaron Lopate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=252.854s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=254.916s">[Graham]</a>: And Luke Prisner, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=256.078s">[Graham]</a>: So 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, five absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=263.286s">[Graham]</a>: Motion, minutes are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=266.239s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I actually think this meeting is gonna be very short and thank you for hopping on and making sure that we have a quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=274.22s">[Graham]</a>: But I am really delighted to report that all of our feasibility, all of our eligibility phase deliverables and getting ahead of myself are complete and submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=288.043s">[Graham]</a>: So that's like a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=290.263s">[Graham]</a>: So just a quick rundown for all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=293.244s">[Graham]</a>: The feasibility study,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=296.328s">[Graham]</a>: funding earmark is something that the council had to take up and vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=301.949s">[Graham]</a>: They did that at the 625 meeting, and they voted to earmark or allocate $3 million for our feasibility study that has been moved into a special account that will sort of sit and wait for us to be ready to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=318.633s">[Graham]</a>: spend that money by a vote of six affirmative, zero negative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=325.857s">[Graham]</a>: And that information has been transmitted over to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=328.638s">[Graham]</a>: We did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=329.739s">[Graham]</a>: They actually had to approve the language up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=334.641s">[Graham]</a>: They were watching closely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=336.002s">[Graham]</a>: They watched the meetings get posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=339.504s">[Graham]</a>: And they were very eager to hear our results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=342.665s">[Graham]</a>: And so they know that that has been approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=345.467s">[Graham]</a>: So that's a really big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=348.288s">[Graham]</a>: and very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=351.269s">[Graham]</a>: The very next day, I finally hit submit on our chapter 74 form, which includes the expanded programs that we're looking to study in our feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=362.231s">[Graham]</a>: So thanks to Dr. Cushing and Chad Fallon in particular, who helped flesh out that document, both from a like current capacity of programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=374.694s">[Graham]</a>: future capacity to demonstrate sort of where the wait list was at, to demonstrate that expansion was viable, as well as the work that they did in the lead up to all of that to bring forward to the school committee a proposal that would have us study five new programs as part of this feasibility study from a space perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=396.779s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that, and you all approved the submission of that form a couple of meetings ago, but all of that went in on the 26th of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=406.505s">[Graham]</a>: The educational profile went in on 7-1 in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=411.607s">[Graham]</a>: because I wanted to read it again with fresh eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=414.488s">[Graham]</a>: It is a 20-something page document that includes a lot of hard work from all of you and the administration in particular who worked hard to answer a lot of questions about teaching methodology and in particular some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=432.877s">[Graham]</a>: questions about early education and child care where we have an opportunity to be thinking about studying those things in our educational profile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=442.504s">[Graham]</a>: So that went in on 7-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=446.127s">[Graham]</a>: You all have copies that Lisa Malone shared with you with this meeting agenda of those two deliverables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=454.774s">[Graham]</a>: We are also working to update the website so that all of those deliverables are available to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=461.202s">[Graham]</a>: So you can look out for that on the public site coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=465.887s">[Graham]</a>: But those deliverables have gone over to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=469.551s">[Graham]</a>: The next thing that we submitted on the 11th, which was last week, was our enrollment projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=473.852s">[Graham]</a>: And that goes through a series of questions around not just school enrollment, but verifying that their numbers that they get from DESE are correct, as well as asking a lot of questions about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=488.664s">[Graham]</a>: um, the development plans of the city in terms of housing, um, housing capacity, housing expansion, um, and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=497.286s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, the mayor's office was very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=499.687s">[Graham]</a>: Alicia Hunt in particular, uh, was critical to collecting all of the information from a whole bunch of, um, different folks, um, across the administration, including like the number of building permits and the housing projects that are, that are sort of in permitting phase and how many units they're supposed to be, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=517.271s">[Graham]</a>: And the other thing we had to submit with our enrollment projection was a lot of information about our special education programs that Joan Bowen helped with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=528.355s">[Graham]</a>: And then a big discussion around our early education and childcare programming that Dr. Pelosi was very integral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=537.799s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that went in on the 7th, sorry, on the 11th, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=543.161s">[Graham]</a>: On Friday evening, thanks to the help of john McLaughlin and in particular, Paul Rousseau and Dr. Cushing, we submitted our maintenance and capital planning documentation, which was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=558.158s">[Graham]</a>: sort of a beast to submit because it covered everything from what are the job descriptions of your maintenance staff to what should your maintenance budget be and if there is a variance between your actual budget and what you think it should be, why is there a variance, and essentially like asking us to respond to how will we ensure good solid maintenance of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=579.783s">[Graham]</a>: So it required<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=580.983s">[Graham]</a>: a ton of exhibits and attachments and lots of work by the finance office under Jerry McHugh and Noel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=591.268s">[Graham]</a>: So all of that work, finally, finally, last finishing touches went in on the 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=600.087s">[Graham]</a>: I did talk with MSBA last week, and at the time, what they indicated to me was that the next step for us would be a meeting where we essentially agree on a certified number of students that we would be studying the size of the building for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=620.915s">[Graham]</a>: When I asked last week what she thought the timeline of that would be, she indicated that we should expect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=627.216s">[Graham]</a>: to set up that meeting either in late summer or early fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=632.978s">[Graham]</a>: And yesterday I got an email saying that they're available to talk to us as soon as next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=637.18s">[Graham]</a>: So we will be having that meeting next week with MSBA and folks from the mayor's team and from the administration where they will go through sort of their deep dive into all of the information we submitted, the housing plans, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=652.785s">[Graham]</a>: And then we will talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=655.531s">[Graham]</a>: what that certified enrollment number should look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=658.492s">[Graham]</a>: So that is the next piece in the puzzle and the next step for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=666.375s">[Graham]</a>: Once that is done, all of our information will have to go to the board for consideration and approval to move to what they call module two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=674.498s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=679.241s">[Graham]</a>: that according to the 270-day timeline that would have had us at the February board meeting, I am hopeful that we will make an appearance at a sooner board meeting than February, given that we're sort of moving quickly through our deliverables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=696.293s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm not sure exactly where that will land or what the lead time is between the time when we say we're sort of all in agreement about this enrollment study and when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=708.522s">[Graham]</a>: reasonably, things can get to the board for consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=711.186s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll sort of learn more about that in the coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=716.212s">[Graham]</a>: But that is a wrap, as they say, for the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=722.501s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll stop and ask if anybody has any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=733.459s">[Graham]</a>: You know how frequently the board meets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=734.9s">[Graham]</a>: Is it quarterly or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=736.722s">[Graham]</a>: They meet every other month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=740.445s">[Graham]</a>: So they have a December meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=742.867s">[Graham]</a>: They have an October meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=745.129s">[Graham]</a>: So they must have an August meeting is my guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=750.433s">[Graham]</a>: But yeah, it's like an every other month schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=757.059s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=758.427s">[Graham]</a>: Well, seeing and hearing no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=761.751s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that I wanted to mention in terms of next steps is for this group to really start to think about immersing itself in what they call module two, which is officially called assembling the project team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=778.251s">[Graham]</a>: So this is where we will put out a procurement to hire an owner's project manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=783.392s">[Graham]</a>: And we will bring that person on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=786.393s">[Graham]</a>: And then that OPM will help us craft our procurement to secure the architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=793.934s">[Graham]</a>: So there is a process around the work that the OPM will do with us in order to inform that architect's bid or bid request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=806.022s">[Graham]</a>: As I've started reading, there is a template that I believe MSBA requires us to use to secure the OPM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=813.991s">[Graham]</a>: I have been in touch with the procurement office to make sure like we have a good understanding of what all is needed from the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=822.22s">[Graham]</a>: um for compliance purposes but between now and the next meeting if you all can find 40 minutes or so to immerse yourself in sort of that next module process I think that would be informative and educational for everybody in terms of like what we need to do but but briefly we will have to form a selection committee who will um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=844.535s">[Graham]</a>: who will pick the OPM essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=848.457s">[Graham]</a>: So there's gonna be some work for us to sort of get that procurement ready to go out the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=853.198s">[Graham]</a>: And then once we receive those bids back, we among us will have to decide how the selection committee will be formed is my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=864.763s">[Graham]</a>: And then there may be some meetings with MSBA or like round tables that happen that they may require us to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=874.195s">[Graham]</a>: There is a whole slew of other things that happen in module two because you move on to the architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=878.258s">[Graham]</a>: But like in my mind, once we have the OPM on board, it will be somebody who does this for a living with MSBA and they will be able to sort of help educate us along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=889.825s">[Graham]</a>: So that's just a sort of to do for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=893.248s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm still like reading and diving through those documents myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=897.691s">[Graham]</a>: So that is something we'll talk about and take up in our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=905.778s">[Graham]</a>: Questions about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=906.759s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=908.843s">[Graham]</a>: Where do we find modulo 2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=911.491s">[Graham]</a>: If you go onto the MSBA website, there's a section called building with us and it specs it out module one, module two, module three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=921.056s">[Graham]</a>: So if you go in there, you can like really dive in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=924.717s">[Graham]</a>: There's lots of help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=925.738s">[Graham]</a>: There's lots of information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=928.359s">[Graham]</a>: All the model documents are out there as well as, you know, there are documents around like really like what they see in terms of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=939.404s">[Graham]</a>: Costs that other communities have incurred or over the course of this next phase, both for the OPM and the designer and then in construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=951.434s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, it's hard to look at those and and really assess like how does that compare to what we will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=958.92s">[Graham]</a>: I will say that MSBA was comfortable with the allocation of $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=964.463s">[Graham]</a>: And they don't give communities numbers, but they are happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=971.386s">[Graham]</a>: They will tell a community if they have not allocated a sufficient amount of funds for the phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=976.408s">[Graham]</a>: So we're good there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=977.449s">[Graham]</a>: And obviously, the procurement will have to support whatever we do from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=983.952s">[Graham]</a>: So yeah, all of that is on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=989.333s">[Graham]</a>: And there's lots of templates and information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=994.054s">[Graham]</a>: Their board meetings are public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=997.135s">[Graham]</a>: Everyone is welcome to join, as are all of their meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1001.757s">[Graham]</a>: So if there are meetings that you see out there, you're all welcome to just join and listen and be a participant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1008.839s">[Graham]</a>: But there will be some formal things that we have to attend over the course of the next phase as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1016.041s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll keep an eye on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1022.357s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions about Module 2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1034.804s">[Graham]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1036.085s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so the other thing that I wanted to make sure that I say out loud is that we originally had an August 14 meeting scheduled for the full committee via zoom, and we will not have that meeting as a full committee, because we are very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1054.98s">[Graham]</a>: in a mode of waiting to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1056.801s">[Graham]</a>: So I don't wanna take up your time in that next meeting if there is an action for this group to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1062.883s">[Graham]</a>: Instead, the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee will meet at that time on August 14th at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1070.286s">[Graham]</a>: And that will help us fill the gap of the meeting that I needed to reschedule at the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1077.811s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and they will be, uh, working on the communications and community agent subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1083.393s">[Graham]</a>: We'll be working on some of the surveys to collect FAQs from, um, from residents, um, as well as, um, a survey that gets out to all our boards and commissions to help understand sort of who needs to be plugged into the process and when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1097.878s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other thing that we'll be working on is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1101.772s">[Graham]</a>: you know, the start of what will become a little bit of like a roadshow kind of document that we can use to talk about where we are with the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1114.413s">[Graham]</a>: And I also am in touch with a couple of folks in a couple of districts about tours to be scheduled over the course of this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1122.181s">[Graham]</a>: So as soon as I have those dates, I will let you know so you can mark your calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1126.805s">[Graham]</a>: My contacts are just trying to like work with their contacts and navigate everybody's school vacation out of office time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1133.632s">[Graham]</a>: So more to come on that, but as those get scheduled, I will keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1141.338s">[Graham]</a>: Um, are there any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1145.719s">[Graham]</a>: Or from the group about where we are and what we're doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1167.327s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, it was a true team effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1172.89s">[Graham]</a>: There was a lot of documentation, particularly on the maintenance capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1177.592s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, thank you for that reminder, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1180.134s">[Graham]</a>: The enrollment projection and the maintenance and capital planning information gets submitted directly into a portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1187.878s">[Graham]</a>: So it's not quite as easy to just pop it out to the site and link it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1194.421s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm working through like how to make that information shareable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1198.484s">[Graham]</a>: Like we have working documents that we use to like get those answers ready and they're a hot mess like working documents are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1206.631s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just gonna, I'm just working on like how to make sure like there can be a cohesive story there and then we will publish all of that stuff out to the website as well if people are interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1216.078s">[Graham]</a>: And we will share all of that with you all as soon as it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1220.196s">[Graham]</a>: as soon as it's cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1221.197s">[Graham]</a>: So that's on my to-do list over the coming days is just to figure out like, especially with the maintenance stuff, it's just, it's a lot and it's a hundred attachments and all kinds of things, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1238.431s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments, thoughts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1251.47s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1276.625s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Mayor Lungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1280.486s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded by Maria Dorsey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1283.847s">[Graham]</a>: And one more painful roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1328.639s">[Graham]</a>: So 12 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, three absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1334.805s">[Graham]</a>: That's probably the fastest meeting we'll ever have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1336.988s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4jH9XTbUU&t=1337.929s">[Graham]</a>: Have a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NuRt8ZLmxsg&t=10.294s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NuRt8ZLmxsg&t=12.595s">[Graham]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NuRt8ZLmxsg&t=87.32s">[Graham]</a>: Do we want to tell anybody who's watching that we will not be returning at the end of executive session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1474.121s">[Graham]</a>: I just have a quick question or a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1477.383s">[Graham]</a>: If possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1482.964s">[Graham]</a>: sort of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1488.847s">[Graham]</a>: And the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1500.813s">[Graham]</a>: So I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1510.987s">[Graham]</a>: like the letter that is attached talks about an impact report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1514.851s">[Graham]</a>: That's important because we want to make sure we're doing those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1517.353s">[Graham]</a>: But if there are other things that sort of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1520.74s">[Graham]</a>: outlying or restrict or govern in some way or operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1530.904s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4288.221s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4289.522s">[Graham]</a>: How much was the grant from DESE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4320.197s">[Graham]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4321.358s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4322.659s">[Graham]</a>: And we've done this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4325.74s">[Graham]</a>: And how did we pay for it in the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4337.263s">[Graham]</a>: And is it a grant that comes around every year or not necessarily?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4342.304s">[Graham]</a>: We have our fingers crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.053s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4376.653s">[Graham]</a>: It's just helpful to know as we ultimately think about the budget and what needs to go in the budget, particularly because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4384.522s">[Graham]</a>: planning for this, if we're doing it in advance, is going to pre-date, you know, precede any sort of budget hearings and approvals and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4391.744s">[Graham]</a>: So when you're ready to present a proposal, please do so that we can figure out how to handle that proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4402.066s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4996.761s">[Graham]</a>: I think the other thing that's important to call out here is the huge disparity in enrollment at our elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5006.685s">[Graham]</a>: In my mind, it was always like about 100 kids different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5010.146s">[Graham]</a>: And now it's like pushing 200 students different between the Roberts and the Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5017.288s">[Graham]</a>: Almost 150 between Brooks and Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5021.03s">[Graham]</a>: And I just want to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5026.833s">[Graham]</a>: to do a couple of things, but one is to put on our radar collectively that like we can't, the gap can't keep widening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5033.958s">[Graham]</a>: Like we have to do something different than we're doing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5039.122s">[Graham]</a>: And I've talked to people about this a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5042.225s">[Graham]</a>: There's not an easy, obvious answer short of like picking a bunch of kids up who live at the McGlynn basically and sending them to the Missatuck or picking a bunch of kids up that live next door to the Brooks and sending them to Missatuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5056.041s">[Graham]</a>: because of the sort of placement of the Missatuck building in the city, there's sort of less that you can draw from to add to those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5065.33s">[Graham]</a>: And I know it's a huge challenge, but I don't think we can continue to like operate in this fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5071.976s">[Graham]</a>: So we have to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5759.446s">[Graham]</a>: One of the things that we've been working on through the MSBA process is working with MSBA to certify our enrollment projection for Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5768.771s">[Graham]</a>: That enrollment projection when we sort of get to agreement is how we will decide how big the school becomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5776.935s">[Graham]</a>: So we've had to actually do a lot of really like interesting and fascinating work around like future projected enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5784.219s">[Graham]</a>: And so we have to give them information about like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5787.975s">[Graham]</a>: our live births and we have to give them information about projected housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5793.399s">[Graham]</a>: And there's been a whole slew of information we've had to provide to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5797.683s">[Graham]</a>: I am working to make it a little bit more digestible because you have to submit everything into this system and it makes it really hard to extract it in a way that it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5809.512s">[Graham]</a>: So I am working on something to be able to put on the website so people can see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5813.636s">[Graham]</a>: But it's been sort of an interesting conversation with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5817.604s">[Graham]</a>: folks at city hall about like what is actually coming down the pike from a housing perspective and housing production goals and all of that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5827.572s">[Graham]</a>: But I think the other thing that I would say is I would love for the city staff to be watching carefully when real estate in the Roberts neighborhood, like directly adjacent becomes available because there is no way out of the parking situation over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5842.664s">[Graham]</a>: And there's no way out of the playground situation without more space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5847.122s">[Graham]</a>: so i do think the city needs to do something seriously to address that because you can't there are 200 more kids trying to use that playground than trying to use the two playgrounds at missituck and a giant field so there's and there's just literally not time to walk to hickey park for recess every single day so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5869.111s">[Graham]</a>: something has to give there, whether that building becomes drastically smaller in enrollment because of the space constraints, or we try to address the space constraints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5879.398s">[Graham]</a>: There's probably a bunch of facets there, some of which are in our control and some of which are probably more city controlled sort of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5888.491s">[Graham]</a>: endeavors and decisions so i think we need to look at all of that when we think about distributing what's a reasonable time frame to get that kind of report of what that looks like or what models are being considered the enrollment projection report probably within a month or so i will have that up online for everybody because it is a document that we can share um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5912.921s">[Graham]</a>: So that piece is easy enough to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5916.143s">[Graham]</a>: It's just sort of, it's a formatting mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5918.725s">[Graham]</a>: And I think it's going to be really hard for people to digest the way that it sort of gets extracted from the system right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5924.589s">[Graham]</a>: In terms of like that bigger conversation about what happens next, I'll defer to the superintendent, but I would imagine we have to have some meetings where we talk about like what even our goals would be for that kind of conversation, because something like that could start like this big and it could end up this big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5941.343s">[Graham]</a>: and it could go in any sort of direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5943.164s">[Graham]</a>: So we might want to think about sort of putting some parameters around what we're trying to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5948.267s">[Graham]</a>: Is that a special meeting of this body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5951.489s">[Graham]</a>: Is it a strategic planning group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5954.031s">[Graham]</a>: I think we could maybe do it either way, but I would think it's maybe a committee of the whole because it's such a big project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6965.589s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6966.95s">[Graham]</a>: I would agree with you that this should go on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6969.791s">[Graham]</a>: I'm generally not in favor of charging kids to get to school, like no matter how they have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6978.636s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we should charge for buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6980.277s">[Graham]</a>: I think we should provide more buses than we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6982.978s">[Graham]</a>: If you've been paying attention on social media, there's a lot of conversation about buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6988.922s">[Graham]</a>: The program around free MBTA transportation was stopped without this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6993.854s">[Graham]</a>: committee's authorization to do so, we have to stop charging kids to get them to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6999.358s">[Graham]</a>: Like it's our job to educate them and we can't do that if they're not in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7002.44s">[Graham]</a>: And so like for me, for any which way that we're gonna charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7008.032s">[Graham]</a>: families to get them to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7010.094s">[Graham]</a>: It just feels like we're heading in the wrong direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7013.516s">[Graham]</a>: I understand that we are charging some kids and not others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7016.699s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that is also a problem, but charging more kids for me doesn't get us closer to the goal of not charging kids to have to get to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7024.244s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm not super in favor of this, but I do think it should go on the agenda separately noticed so that parents can understand that that's what we are talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8155.634s">[Graham]</a>: I have huge reservations about any idea that we would have to bring buses in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8161.829s">[Graham]</a>: I would need to see a bullet proof plan that we're going to do it well, because I think we try to do a lot of things here on the cheap and it never works out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8172.692s">[Graham]</a>: So it would take a lot of convincing for me to agree that we have the organizational capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8180.974s">[Graham]</a>: We lack basic systems and structures every single place that you look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8186.192s">[Graham]</a>: to think about bringing on something that we know nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8189.273s">[Graham]</a>: I have huge reservations about, I think we could maybe get there at some point, but what I would like to see is for us to own the pieces of this process that we already own and don't do well every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8202.119s">[Graham]</a>: So we need to completely re-envision how we think about bus service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8207.061s">[Graham]</a>: We should not be asking families if they are gonna ride the bus, unless we know that they're eligible to ride the bus and that we have space for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8214.984s">[Graham]</a>: We know where every kid lives and we should be using that information proactively before two weeks before the start of school to be mapping routes and doing all the things that we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8226.33s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's a huge amount of improvement to make all around, including with our vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8233.414s">[Graham]</a>: And if we need to have them come to a future meeting, I'm happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8237.455s">[Graham]</a>: It's a very complicated problem, but we have to own the pieces of this problem that we have failed at as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8243.097s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the communication piece of this and the planning and really just sitting back and saying, what should this process look like and when would these steps happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8252.92s">[Graham]</a>: would probably result in a completely different process than we do today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8258.164s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that is something we can actionably do, whether we have two more buses or three more buses or zero more buses, like we can get the registration process right and we're not even there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8269.492s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think that needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8272.454s">[Graham]</a>: We need to not be in situations where we're sending<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8276.286s">[Graham]</a>: emails to families after the start of school, telling them, hey, change your plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8281.827s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, we don't actually have a bus for your kids after all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8285.188s">[Graham]</a>: We need to do better by this process for the things that we can control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8289.489s">[Graham]</a>: And it's not everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8290.509s">[Graham]</a>: We can't control how many bus drivers quit training in the week before school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8296.53s">[Graham]</a>: We can't control that, but we can control a whole lot of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8300.732s">[Graham]</a>: I do think I would like to see some sort of analysis of like how this process should go in the future because I don't think we're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8309.46s">[Graham]</a>: And this is extraordinarily complicated issue I get that and I appreciate that and I just want to say I know how hard people are working to try to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8319.827s">[Graham]</a>: the like unexpected string of problems that are sort of unfolding as the school year unfolds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8325.673s">[Graham]</a>: And I do really, really appreciate their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8328.195s">[Graham]</a>: We have a new coordinator of transportation in our administrative assistance unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8333.2s">[Graham]</a>: She's learning a brand new job that never existed before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8336.838s">[Graham]</a>: and having to do this all at prime time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8339.279s">[Graham]</a>: The office is frankly probably too small to have a director that shares responsibilities with all kinds of things and this, and just one administrative assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8348.742s">[Graham]</a>: Like there's a lot of problems here that we need to own ourselves and try to fix and do better by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8353.623s">[Graham]</a>: Because if we could tighten all of that up, would this problem have been better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8359.024s">[Graham]</a>: Probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8360.885s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe not entirely, but probably at least somewhat better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8364.486s">[Graham]</a>: And we need to do that next year because we just can't, we just, we do this every year, every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8369.49s">[Graham]</a>: It's chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8370.772s">[Graham]</a>: And it seems like the chaos shifts every year, but it's still chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8375.135s">[Graham]</a>: So we need to maybe try not to do chaos next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9284.521s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Cushing, before you continue, are there any questions about what Dr. Cushing has gone through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9288.984s">[Graham]</a>: He just did like three updates real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.045s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9291.866s">[Graham]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9850.756s">[Graham]</a>: We don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have one item of new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9857.961s">[Graham]</a>: It is offered by Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9860.583s">[Graham]</a>: It's the first reading of policy AC, non-discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9866.186s">[Graham]</a>: So I am going to read this in its entirety because I know there's some urgency to this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9871.369s">[Graham]</a>: So the Medford School Committee and Medford Public Schools are committed to maintaining an education and work environment for all school community members free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9881.534s">[Graham]</a>: School community members include school committee, employees, administration, faculty, staff, students, volunteers in the schools, and parties contracted to perform work for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9891.715s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford Public Schools does not exclude from participation, deny the benefits of the Medford Public Schools from or otherwise discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, religion, disability, age, genetic information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9910.442s">[Graham]</a>: active military veteran status, marital status, familial status, pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, housing status, ancestry, ethnic background, national origin, or any other category protected by state or federal law in the administration of its educational and employment policies or in its programs and activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9929.332s">[Graham]</a>: This commitment to the community is affirmed by the following statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9932.333s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford School Committee commits to, one, promoting the rights and responsibilities of all individuals set forth in the state and federal constitution's pertinent legislation and applicable judicial interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9945.297s">[Graham]</a>: Number two, encourage positive experiences and human values for children, youth, and adults, all of whom have differing personal and family characteristics and come from various socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9957.27s">[Graham]</a>: Number three, work toward a more integrated society and enlisting the support of individuals as well as groups and agencies, both private and governmental in such an effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9966.675s">[Graham]</a>: Number four, using all appropriate communication and action techniques to air and address the grievances of individuals and groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9973.578s">[Graham]</a>: Number five, carefully consider in all the decisions made within the school district, the potential benefits or adverse consequences of those decisions on human relations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9983.331s">[Graham]</a>: Number six, initiating the process of reviewing policies and practices of the school district to achieve to the greatest extent possible the objectives of the statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9993.339s">[Graham]</a>: The Medford Public Schools requires all members of the school community to conduct themselves in accordance with this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9998.122s">[Graham]</a>: It shall be a violation of this policy for any member of the school community to engage in any form of discrimination, including harassment, retaliation, or to violate any other civil right of any member of the school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10010.051s">[Graham]</a>: We recognize that discrimination can take a range of forms and can be targeted or unintentional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10014.754s">[Graham]</a>: However, discrimination in any form, including harassment and retaliation, will not be tolerated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10019.957s">[Graham]</a>: It shall also be a violation of this policy for any school community member to subject any other member of the school community to any form of retaliation, including but not limited to coercion, intimidation, interference, punishment, discrimination, or harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10035.705s">[Graham]</a>: for reporting or filing a complaint of discrimination, cooperating in an investigation, aiding or encouraging another member of the school committee to report such conduct or file a complaint, or opposing any act or practice reasonably believed to be prohibited by this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10052.013s">[Graham]</a>: There is an asterisk from an earlier list about race, race to include traits historically associated with race, including but not limited to hair texture, hair type, hair length, and protective hairstyles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10065.595s">[Graham]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10121.797s">[Graham]</a>: And just for context, the Title IX regulations have changed recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10128.079s">[Graham]</a>: And so this is us sort of getting into line with those new regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10133.74s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=337.867s">[Graham]</a>: I do think this will be a very brief meeting, but I did want to give you a number of updates just in terms of where we are in the process and what we have ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=416.579s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=420.301s">[Graham]</a>: Aaron Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=423.303s">[Graham]</a>: And Luke Preissner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=428.638s">[Graham]</a>: 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, four absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=433.782s">[Graham]</a>: The minutes are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=437.384s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so flipping back to our agenda, I just wanted to give you all a couple of updates, and then we have really one topic to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=445.989s">[Graham]</a>: So as you know, when we met back even in July, we talked about...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=453.534s">[Graham]</a>: that all of our documentation had been submitted and that we were awaiting information from the MSBA about the enrollment study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=462.616s">[Graham]</a>: So we have, since that time, we have met with the MSBA about our enrollment projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=471.498s">[Graham]</a>: So if you all recall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=475.72s">[Graham]</a>: That is a critical step in this eligibility phase because what the design enrollment is certified at that we will ultimately agree to with MSBA is how we will go forward to size the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=488.183s">[Graham]</a>: So in terms of any project that comes next, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=494.284s">[Graham]</a>: So that we all have to agree on like how many students are we trying to accommodate for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=500.145s">[Graham]</a>: We provided a whole bunch of information to them about Medford's housing market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=505.653s">[Graham]</a>: about our historical enrollment, among other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=509.575s">[Graham]</a>: And we did hold an enrollment meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=512.977s">[Graham]</a>: They presented us their preliminary numbers and they had a series of really good questions for us about what may not have like, I'll say like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=524.904s">[Graham]</a>: come through in answering the questions that they standardly pose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=530.305s">[Graham]</a>: So we had a really good conversation about some of the additional factors from Medford's perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=537.427s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor is part of the Metro Planning Council, and they are committed to helping the governor achieve their goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=545.188s">[Graham]</a>: We have an aggressive housing production plan, those kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=548.009s">[Graham]</a>: So we were able to have some good conversation about a whole variety of topics that impact enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=554.81s">[Graham]</a>: At the end of the conversation, they asked us for some more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=558.112s">[Graham]</a>: So we actually did provide that to them in mid-August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=562.214s">[Graham]</a>: And we are awaiting feedback from them about the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=565.596s">[Graham]</a>: So more to come on getting through this last piece of the eligibility phase as we hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=576.453s">[Graham]</a>: What we have done in the meantime is thanks to the help of Will Pipicelli, who's on the call, he is replacing Tom Dalton on the committee as soon as the school committee votes that change through officially, but he's here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=592.387s">[Graham]</a>: He's joined us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=593.649s">[Graham]</a>: He's our director of communications for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=596.931s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to welcome him to the team unofficially and we'll welcome him officially once the committee...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=602.676s">[Graham]</a>: goes through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=603.777s">[Graham]</a>: But Will and I have been working on two efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=609.38s">[Graham]</a>: One is to take all the documentation that we had to submit to MSBA around this enrollment study and put it into a digestible format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=619.645s">[Graham]</a>: The other was to do the same with all the maintenance and capital planning information that we had to submit because all of those submissions go into their computer system and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=630.051s">[Graham]</a>: don't spit out all that great or with like enough context that it would sort of resonate for us to post that on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=637.716s">[Graham]</a>: So I believe that you all received both of those documents before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=644.701s">[Graham]</a>: That's really just more for you to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=647.603s">[Graham]</a>: We would obviously, we do plan to post those on the website so that everybody can see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=653.747s">[Graham]</a>: But those two documents are hot off the presses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=657.109s">[Graham]</a>: Will and I were working on finalizing them today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=660.351s">[Graham]</a>: Many, many thanks to Will for his work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=665.013s">[Graham]</a>: Pulling together all of the information was not an easy task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=668.535s">[Graham]</a>: There's lots of attachments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=670.716s">[Graham]</a>: The enrollment projection information is particularly sort of tedious to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=676.212s">[Graham]</a>: to get through and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=677.293s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you for that, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=680.034s">[Graham]</a>: And I want to make sure that you all saw those attachments from Lisa just a little bit ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=686.458s">[Graham]</a>: So take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=687.998s">[Graham]</a>: We will post them on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=689.519s">[Graham]</a>: I will plan to share them out on social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=692.201s">[Graham]</a>: And Will and I will talk about a plan to do that from the school account instead of from my personal account so that there can be record of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=701.281s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to provide that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=702.802s">[Graham]</a>: So we're still very much in wait mode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=707.044s">[Graham]</a>: And we are waiting on those next steps from the MSBA and just ready and willing when they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=716.371s">[Graham]</a>: So I am planning to touch base with our contact there later this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=721.094s">[Graham]</a>: And I will let you know if there's anything material that sort of comes next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=727.718s">[Graham]</a>: Also, in terms of the timeline,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=730.764s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I'm not a hundred percent clear when we will sort of exit this phase because we are sort of at, we're at the end, but we're not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=741.311s">[Graham]</a>: So I think some of that will drive, um, the board meeting, um, placement wherever we, um, wherever we land, once we get through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=750.037s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the other, uh, part of the timeline is I haven't scheduled any meetings because I don't want to take up your valuable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=756.501s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=758.317s">[Graham]</a>: until we have better clarity on those next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=762.198s">[Graham]</a>: We will talk a little bit about sort of getting ready for the next phase in just a minute, but we are going to try to use this time to provide some opportunities for folks to go tour other buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=773.981s">[Graham]</a>: We do have a tour of Arlington High School on the books for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=777.621s">[Graham]</a>: You're all welcome to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=779.502s">[Graham]</a>: It's at three o'clock on the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=782.883s">[Graham]</a>: The Arlington Project is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=786.992s">[Graham]</a>: probably even more open now than it was when I went to tour the building back in like May or June because it is a phased renovation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=795.674s">[Graham]</a>: We are also working on plans to talk to Waltham, Somerville, Stoneham, and Bill Ricka.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=808.678s">[Graham]</a>: So more to come as we get those dates on the calendar and Lisa will push out invitations to you all to join us as you are able.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=817.082s">[Graham]</a>: So we're sort of taking this time where we have some quiet time to also take some tours and get inspired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=824.886s">[Graham]</a>: So that's on the immediate agenda and we'll work through getting those on the books and then we can regroup if there's anywhere else that we want to take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=834.45s">[Graham]</a>: Questions about the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=843.215s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so the other major part of our agenda today is that as we start sort of looking forward to that next phase, our next, assuming that we are invited to the next phase, which is part of this MSBA process, the next phase really would be for us to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=865.535s">[Graham]</a>: put out a public procurement and onboard our owner's project manager who will help lead this project forward as it gets increasingly technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=874.697s">[Graham]</a>: So in order to do that under MSBA's guidelines, what we need to do is form an OPM selection committee that will help sort of get that procurement in place and out the door and shepherd that through the selection process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=894.919s">[Graham]</a>: There are certain people that have to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=897.12s">[Graham]</a>: Fiona is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=898.38s">[Graham]</a>: I believe Bob Dickinson is another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=901.061s">[Graham]</a>: I think he has to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=904.502s">[Graham]</a>: But I did want to talk about that among this group because there is also a gate that the school committee will need to approve whoever that selection committee is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=915.386s">[Graham]</a>: So even though they're a subcommittee of our committee, according to MSBA, the school committee needs to sign off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=923.288s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to open that up for a little bit of discussion about the sort of our best next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=929.652s">[Graham]</a>: Do we want to nominate folks tonight so that I can sort of be ready to feed that to the school committee when appropriate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=937.577s">[Graham]</a>: Or do we want to do that at a later meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=939.598s">[Graham]</a>: I'm open to both options, but I know the school committee agenda can be sort of big and packed at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=946.382s">[Graham]</a>: So advanced notice would be helpful because then I have a little bit of runway to figure out how to get it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=953.422s">[Graham]</a>: But that team, I believe, can start meeting to start to do the documentation work to put the procurement documents in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=963.836s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think if we sort of have that committee at the ready, they can be moving along because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=971.089s">[Graham]</a>: the ultimate goal of this next phase is to get the OPM on board and then ultimately the designer or the architect, but the OPM comes first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=980.412s">[Graham]</a>: So we have to do the OPM and then the architect, and then we can get to ultimately the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=986.313s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=987.934s">[Graham]</a>: If anyone has any comments, questions, thoughts, I'm happy to take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=996.156s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1021.966s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1024.127s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, they were invited at the same meeting we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1040.806s">[Graham]</a>: Except those bleachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1041.986s">[Graham]</a>: But yeah, if you all haven't seen the news articles, there's an issue in their gymnasium of the newly opened school where their bleachers are too big for the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1055.7s">[Graham]</a>: gym itself and so they the bleachers come out onto the playing floor um so now that i've said that it'll be in your social media feed and you can take a look at the article but um yeah so we we are trying to um to get to to waltham um in particular i know that they just opened so they will it'll be a different aspect of like sort of their reactions to that building for sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1106.909s">[Graham]</a>: So part of the work of that committee is going to be to sort of follow the template set out by MSBA around the procurements and make sure that we're in good position to be in compliance with all of Medford's procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1123.044s">[Graham]</a>: So I think, you know...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1125.393s">[Graham]</a>: if you have procurement experience, that's a plus, because that is fundamentally what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1131.335s">[Graham]</a>: If you have experience working with OPMs, I think that is also a plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1139.279s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, bringing that group together, the other thing that group will do is figure out, like, what is the process that we're going to go through to actually select the OPM?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1151.604s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1153.354s">[Graham]</a>: I would imagine that this larger group will certainly be invited to the table to listen to presentations and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1162.301s">[Graham]</a>: But ultimately, the recommendation and the selection of the OPM is going to have to sort of go through the selection committee and then to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1171.767s">[Graham]</a>: So I think time-wise, it's going to happen in like...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1176.218s">[Graham]</a>: sort of bursts, and I can't really even tell you when the bursts will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1181.686s">[Graham]</a>: Certainly, there's some upfront work to get those ARFPs out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1184.99s">[Graham]</a>: Once they're out, there's sort of a quiet period, right, where we have to answer some questions, and then we really can't talk about the bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1194.024s">[Graham]</a>: And then once everything comes in, we'll have to have an established timeline to work through all of those submissions, do interviews, and ultimately make a selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1202.95s">[Graham]</a>: So whenever that happens, it's going to be the most time intensive space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1208.313s">[Graham]</a>: Some of that will be a function of how many OPMs bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1213.997s">[Graham]</a>: So it's really hard to know, but doing bid reviews can be really, really time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1222.928s">[Graham]</a>: I do think there's a decent amount of work there for the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1281.189s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a couple questions there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1283.11s">[Graham]</a>: One is not all people play all roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1286.071s">[Graham]</a>: Not all organizations do all the roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1288.011s">[Graham]</a>: Some do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1289.232s">[Graham]</a>: So some are architects and OPMs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1292.132s">[Graham]</a>: Some are just architects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1293.373s">[Graham]</a>: Some are just OPMs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1294.633s">[Graham]</a>: And any version of that could...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1298.606s">[Graham]</a>: be what we see in terms of our bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1300.787s">[Graham]</a>: The OPM is going to help us do the heavy lifting to get the designer and the construction manager on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1307.068s">[Graham]</a>: So this work of getting the OPM on board is our work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1312.329s">[Graham]</a>: Once we do that, we now have somebody like paid staff that's going to help shepherd the rest of that along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1318.45s">[Graham]</a>: They certainly are going to have a wealth of information about who does this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1324.144s">[Graham]</a>: who they've worked with before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1326.506s">[Graham]</a>: But ultimately, this committee is going to make those selections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1329.208s">[Graham]</a>: So no, there is no such thing as a forced marriage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1333.352s">[Graham]</a>: Who we hire to be the architect, who we hire to be the construction manager is up to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1339.437s">[Graham]</a>: But the OPM, you know, ideally is the person who can help guide this committee and do the heavy lifting for us once we have them on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1348.604s">[Graham]</a>: But it is really important to pick an OPM that sort of reflects<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1354.264s">[Graham]</a>: what we want to see as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1356.506s">[Graham]</a>: So, you know, finding the OPM that's a good fit for us is really, really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1369.636s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1384.562s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1385.382s">[Graham]</a>: I mean, I think as soon as we are invited to the next phase, I would like our RFP to be out the door within 30 days max, because the sooner we do that, the sooner we have somebody on board and the sooner those next phases can happen, which is why I would like to get the procurement documents created in advance of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1407.813s">[Graham]</a>: But it's really hard to say because it will be driven by when MSBA invites us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1414.136s">[Graham]</a>: the board meeting to advance us to the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1417.119s">[Graham]</a>: So those options, they meet every other month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1421.562s">[Graham]</a>: They do not meet in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1422.923s">[Graham]</a>: So they meet in October, they meet in December and they meet in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1427.027s">[Graham]</a>: If I had to guess, like where I think we're likely to be at the December board meeting, there's maybe an outside chance we'll make it to October, but we're not slated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1439.297s">[Graham]</a>: We were not originally slated to go to a board meeting until I think February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1460.342s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think we can have that conversation and decide who those folks are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1465.785s">[Graham]</a>: It has to go to the school committee for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1469.747s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't believe there's any reason why we can't begin work, but I will confirm that with MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1475.291s">[Graham]</a>: So I think if there are people who want to be part of this process, those nominations tonight would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1518.0s">[Graham]</a>: The next phase is forming the team, which includes the OPM and the architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1523.703s">[Graham]</a>: Then the feasibility study happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1525.464s">[Graham]</a>: So the two things that must happen are we must have an OPM and we must have an architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1531.926s">[Graham]</a>: And then we get invited to feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1534.187s">[Graham]</a>: The construction manager comes later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1537.937s">[Graham]</a>: But we so we have to get the OPM on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1541.518s">[Graham]</a>: They will help us get the designer on board and then we will be ready for feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1546.459s">[Graham]</a>: So there's actually several there's a couple of MSBA gates there in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1553.201s">[Graham]</a>: Because they they do have to approve our OPM, they have to approve our designer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1557.242s">[Graham]</a>: There's a lot of approvals that they have to do along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1566.9s">[Graham]</a>: I do believe that Fiona has to be on the team and I believe Bob does, but they are both non-voting members of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1577.044s">[Graham]</a>: So there need to be at least three voting members of the committee on this subcommittee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1585.348s">[Graham]</a>: So I certainly will be on the committee, but I would love other folks to join us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.249s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Libby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1602.809s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anybody else that's dying to be on the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1615.556s">[Graham]</a>: And that goes for non-voting members as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1620.859s">[Graham]</a>: You're very welcome to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1625.578s">[Graham]</a>: We just need to make sure we have enough voting members that it can be a legitimate committee to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1656.178s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, there's definitely a circuit of folks that play in this space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1660.0s">[Graham]</a>: So we will proactively reach out to all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1664.783s">[Graham]</a>: And they're at conferences, they're at school committee conferences and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1668.404s">[Graham]</a>: So we have plenty of opportunities to meet folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1751.268s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1752.369s">[Graham]</a>: So Aaron, maybe you can be our fourth member so that we have some flexibility in terms of having a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1762.613s">[Graham]</a>: And sometimes you just need arms and legs, people to review, make sure things make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1769.849s">[Graham]</a>: So I think that would be a great role for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1773.751s">[Graham]</a>: And you can learn all about the city's procurement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1777.412s">[Graham]</a>: And then I'm sure that can be useful somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1781.774s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1782.554s">[Graham]</a>: So what I have is Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, Fiona, and Bob, if Bob is required and or wants to be on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1793.278s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1807.269s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I'm going to put your name down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1810.15s">[Graham]</a>: So is there a motion to approve this group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1813.632s">[Graham]</a>: Fiona, Bob, if required, Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, and John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1818.575s">[Graham]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1820.716s">[Graham]</a>: Motion by Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1824.349s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1827.211s">[Graham]</a>: Tracy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1827.811s">[Graham]</a>: And we'll do a quick roll call because we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1835.296s">[Graham]</a>: Jenny Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2149.034s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2149.334s">[Graham]</a>: So we have one, two, three, four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2151.676s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2153.557s">[Graham]</a>: One.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2155.598s">[Graham]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2156.419s">[Graham]</a>: We have a quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2157.96s">[Graham]</a>: Hello, Dr. Edward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2160.66s">[Graham]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2161.181s">[Graham]</a>: I thought it was a separate link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2163.203s">[Graham]</a>: I did too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2164.924s">[Graham]</a>: I signed off and back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2166.065s">[Graham]</a>: So I did the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2169.709s">[Graham]</a>: So for this group, I did want to introduce Will formally and give him a minute to introduce himself because we will be working really closely with Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2179.639s">[Graham]</a>: So welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2180.88s">[Graham]</a>: Will, did you want to introduce yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2227.196s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2229.489s">[Graham]</a>: So, Will and I have, as I mentioned in the last meeting, been working behind the scenes to sort of make some of those submissions a little bit more digestible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2238.532s">[Graham]</a>: All the credit to Will for doing a really fabulous job and doing it in a really quick turnaround kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2244.594s">[Graham]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2246.694s">[Graham]</a>: And we will post those out on the website and make them available for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2253.917s">[Graham]</a>: I think...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2255.563s">[Graham]</a>: you know, the maintenance and capital planning document is, is like dry reading, because it's about maintenance and capital planning, which is inherently not that exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2266.792s">[Graham]</a>: But there's actually like a lot of really great information in there about how the district is moving forward around maintenance, our custodial services, we have a green cleaning plan, we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2286.751s">[Graham]</a>: an ongoing preventive maintenance plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2290.713s">[Graham]</a>: We have a lot of things now that are documented that was not always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2297.576s">[Graham]</a>: So it's nice to be able to sort of showcase all of those things in one cohesive package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2304.938s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that's really enlightening about that document, I think, is when you look at some of the capital planning questions that the MSBA posed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2315.005s">[Graham]</a>: They asked questions like, how big is your maintenance budget and how big should it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2325.515s">[Graham]</a>: if there's a gap, why is there a gap?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2328.438s">[Graham]</a>: So they really are looking for people to be good stewards of their funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2333.583s">[Graham]</a>: And they asked really good questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2336.586s">[Graham]</a>: They asked us to break things down sometimes in ways that we don't break things down in our sort of universe here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2343.672s">[Graham]</a>: So that has led to some conversations about breaking things down differently in the future, which I think is all good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2350.578s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other document about the enrollment projection I thought was very enlightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2357.281s">[Graham]</a>: That one took a lot of work to come together cohesively because they were seemingly very desperate things that had to be covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2367.326s">[Graham]</a>: And we were able to, I think, do a good job of sharing in that document everything that we've provided to MSBA about our plans and some of the things that we see coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2378.977s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and ultimately a justification for a building size for 1500 students plus, um, 200, um, 200 pre-K students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2391.159s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and I think, uh, another 100 kids corner, um, early childhood folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2400.681s">[Graham]</a>: So, uh, children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2402.142s">[Graham]</a>: So the total enrollment we put forward was 1800, which includes 1500 high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2409.689s">[Graham]</a>: 200 pre-K programming, and then 100 for kids scoring to sort of comprise everything that is in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2419.856s">[Graham]</a>: So it's sort of interesting to dig in there and see some of the information that we provided them, particularly if you've ever wondered like, what are we doing in housing in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2429.103s">[Graham]</a>: It's like a nice handy summary of those things because we really had to boil it up to provide it to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2435.527s">[Graham]</a>: So we'll get those out on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2438.73s">[Graham]</a>: But I did want to have some space on the agenda in case there was anything else that you all were thinking about for the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2445.495s">[Graham]</a>: Now that we have Will on board, he'll be taking the reins on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2449.559s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to open it up to the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2451.661s">[Graham]</a>: I know there's not been tons of conversation of late in the community about this project because we've got other big things to talk about as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2461.649s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that that will continue through November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2464.811s">[Graham]</a>: But I think just as soon as that's done and we're sort of moving on to those next gates, this will become all the conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2471.977s">[Graham]</a>: So I did want to like set aside just a little bit of time for us to think about like some of the planning exercises to be ready for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2479.544s">[Graham]</a>: So is there any, does anybody have any questions, comments about the website, Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2539.197s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, I do believe that they play heavily in that space, as well as in general in this community engagement space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2548.543s">[Graham]</a>: So they will help drive some of the community engagement events that happen as we get into the design phase and that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2612.327s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2614.578s">[Graham]</a>: Any other questions, comments, thoughts about the website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2617.9s">[Graham]</a>: I know it's just been, you know, quiet at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2621.442s">[Graham]</a>: Maria?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2693.55s">[Graham]</a>: take a look through some of the model OPM procurement documents to figure out where do they fit, I guess I'll say, in the process of doing some of this work around PR, just to make sure that we have sort of an understanding of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2712.882s">[Graham]</a>: But I don't think there's really any reason why they couldn't get started in advance of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2717.125s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2718.225s">[Graham]</a>: And Maria, I will follow up with you and let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2725.182s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2726.162s">[Graham]</a>: So the other thing I wanted to sort of circle back to that we talked about back in June was two updates, two surveys that we were going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2736.77s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanted to sort of bring Will into the fold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2739.953s">[Graham]</a>: We had some conversation about doing a survey to all of our boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2745.157s">[Graham]</a>: So Medford has like, I don't know, 20 or 30 boards and commissions, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2750.721s">[Graham]</a>: And they all have different, probably different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2754.255s">[Graham]</a>: sort of attachments and levels of interest in the high school project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2760.602s">[Graham]</a>: Some probably have a very high interest in a lot of things about the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2764.623s">[Graham]</a>: Others may have, you know, just sort of fleeting interest or want to know different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2769.445s">[Graham]</a>: So we did talk about creating a survey for the boards and commissions to try to get a feel for and an understanding of like where best to plug them all into the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2783.85s">[Graham]</a>: And I wanted to check in with this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2786.151s">[Graham]</a>: I actually think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2787.731s">[Graham]</a>: now is good timing to put that survey together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2791.734s">[Graham]</a>: And we do have questions from our last meeting and give them some time in the next like six weeks or so to get back to us so that we can be prepared with that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2804.325s">[Graham]</a>: On the flip side, the FAQ survey, I have a little bit of a different opinion about, but I wanted to talk to this group about that timing and whether you think that's like the right timing for boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2814.98s">[Graham]</a>: and whether there's like any reason for us not to pursue that sort of in the next like two months or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2853.75s">[Graham]</a>: No, we actually had established some questions in one of our last meetings to actually push out a formal survey so that we can get some standard responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2863.478s">[Graham]</a>: And I think if I'm remembering correctly, one of the questions is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2867.236s">[Graham]</a>: do you want somebody from the building committee to come present to you about the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2872.718s">[Graham]</a>: Would that be helpful for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2874.119s">[Graham]</a>: And if so, what is your meeting schedule and that kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2877.28s">[Graham]</a>: And then we'll have to do some descriptor of what we see the process as so that they can say, this is how I think I can be helpful to this project or this is the kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2890.405s">[Graham]</a>: input or place in the process that I would like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2893.426s">[Graham]</a>: So it's questions like that to help us frame when we should be reaching out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2898.407s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2899.968s">[Graham]</a>: And of course, we'll welcome their other questions, but it is like a defined survey set of four or five questions so that we can get a consistent response from them and then figure out how we proceed once we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2923.003s">[Graham]</a>: Well, I think we talked about them in our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2925.264s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2927.725s">[Graham]</a>: And so we can certainly pull those back up and Will and I will work on that and put something together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2933.988s">[Graham]</a>: And Will, we will send a copy to this group so that you know what those questions are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=2941.852s">[Graham]</a>: And if there's any comments, you can let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3010.186s">[Graham]</a>: The other survey that we talked about was a survey around the FAQs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3016.814s">[Graham]</a>: So really to start to ask the community, what are the kinds of questions you have about this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3027.245s">[Graham]</a>: given that we have a lot of other like hot topics related to schools going on in the community right now, I'm of the mind that we should defer pushing that survey out until like mid to late November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3041.688s">[Graham]</a>: And that with a goal of, you know, being able to put some of those FAQs up by the end of the year, I think it will get lost in the noise if we try to do anything sooner than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3054.451s">[Graham]</a>: Does everyone agree with that approach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3109.858s">[Graham]</a>: Cool, so we'll...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3114.758s">[Graham]</a>: I think, roughly speaking, we'll plan to meet at some point after, like, in the mid-November timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3121.683s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe we can, like, Will and I, Will can draft up the survey to be able to push out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3128.648s">[Graham]</a>: We can review it together and then make a plan to push it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3131.87s">[Graham]</a>: So I think for this group, maybe the next time we meet can be, you know, mid to late November, like mid-November-ish, post-election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3140.396s">[Graham]</a>: Does that work for everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3151.403s">[Graham]</a>: And then the other thing that I do think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3156.212s">[Graham]</a>: I would like for us to work on, and it can, it can come from the, I think from the district, maybe as an attachment, Dr. Edward Vincent to your weekly email is just an update on where we are, something sort of brief that says we're done with our deliverables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3171.861s">[Graham]</a>: You can find them all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3174.883s">[Graham]</a>: And, you know, the next step is this, and we await that, you know, we await information from MSPA on taking that next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3181.266s">[Graham]</a>: And in the meantime,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3182.625s">[Graham]</a>: we'll be coming to you to solicit questions and stay tuned for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3186.768s">[Graham]</a>: So something along that line so that people have an understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3249.868s">[Graham]</a>: It may not be ready for this week, but maybe next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3252.388s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3254.009s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3256.771s">[Graham]</a>: And that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3257.951s">[Graham]</a>: That's all I had for this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3259.192s">[Graham]</a>: So it actually was a quick short meeting again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3262.613s">[Graham]</a>: So thank you guys for joining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3265.014s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other questions before we adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3283.099s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3288.355s">[Graham]</a>: By Nicole, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3290.837s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3301.603s">[Graham]</a>: Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3302.403s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, not Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3303.444s">[Graham]</a>: Luke Preissner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3309.688s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3311.129s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3311.889s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3316.639s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3318.041s">[Graham]</a>: Four in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3320.926s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3322.909s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3323.51s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=3328.578s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks, Will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10146.658s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10231.957s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10233.857s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to point out that this committee, several years ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10239.848s">[Graham]</a>: made a resolution to make those bus passes free and that the decision to start charging for those again was not brought before this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10249.795s">[Graham]</a>: So as far as I'm concerned, there's a policy compliance issue there because we were very clear that we did not want to charge kids for those bus passes to get to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10261.523s">[Graham]</a>: I am hopeful that if the overrides are successful, we can immediately institute a change there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10267.321s">[Graham]</a>: I acknowledge that the program as it was originally envisioned may need to change, but if we're talking about transit in compliance with our policy being charged, I'm just overall not in favor of that in any regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10285.136s">[Graham]</a>: But I do wanna point out for everybody who is new, we did this, we said it, we voted on it and it like reappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10292.662s">[Graham]</a>: And that was not a decision by this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10296.738s">[Graham]</a>: we need to get back to addressing that just as soon as there's more than no money in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10303.961s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing I would like to put on the table for the administration to consider is that we should know who is parking in our school and whether we charge for it or not, every person parking in our parking lot, including staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10323.228s">[Graham]</a>: should have to have a parking permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10325.01s">[Graham]</a>: They should have to be registered with the school with a license plate and a car that they're going to be driving to school without exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10333.221s">[Graham]</a>: And then obviously you deal with visitors sort of separately and there's visitor parking now that's very well signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10339.59s">[Graham]</a>: So...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10340.671s">[Graham]</a>: that should be happening i'm surprised it's not frankly because we have no way of knowing which of those cars are there um in a in a way that is consistent with what we're trying to do in the building so that is maybe a separate issue i would like to hear a report on at some point in time but um it doesn't that that parking permit does not have to come with the fee necessarily um depending on how this vote goes tonight but i i would be absolutely in favor of making sure that we understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10369.377s">[Graham]</a>: who is driving cars onto the campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10418.348s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve the senior decorate your parking space $75 fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11007.415s">[Graham]</a>: So the school committee does have graduation requirements outlined in the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11012.598s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10433.796s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10434.836s">[Graham]</a>: Can you tell me a little bit about where the content for Caregiver University comes from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10440.16s">[Graham]</a>: Like, are we creating content?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10441.862s">[Graham]</a>: Are we buying content?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10499.51s">[Graham]</a>: And is it videos?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10501.671s">[Graham]</a>: Is it actual e-learning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10504.672s">[Graham]</a>: Is it seminars?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10507.493s">[Graham]</a>: Can I watch this stuff any time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10510.053s">[Graham]</a>: Or how do I consume it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10607.054s">[Graham]</a>: So I guess what I would like to see is that there's like a central place where all of this content can live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10615.176s">[Graham]</a>: Like the athletics night is a great example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10617.316s">[Graham]</a>: It was mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10618.237s">[Graham]</a>: I was unable to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10622.918s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know how I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10624.955s">[Graham]</a>: address that as a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10626.596s">[Graham]</a>: But no one's followed up with me either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10628.138s">[Graham]</a>: So that would be like an example of, yes, it's in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10632.901s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, you want people to come in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10635.303s">[Graham]</a>: But what, like, what can this platform do for us to make sure that actually the parents who couldn't, I think there might have been a school committee, something at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10645.851s">[Graham]</a>: So who can't come for whatever the reason might be still get the content that is happening in those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10653.806s">[Graham]</a>: important meetings, because like you said, people are busy, they people need to be able to consume content, sort of when it's convenient for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10660.829s">[Graham]</a>: But I think in some cases, we also need to know that they consumed content, like, every time I register Lucas for sports, there's like 100 pages of waivers, and 100 things I'm supposed to like, view and watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10677.716s">[Graham]</a>: And I actually make an effort to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10680.137s">[Graham]</a>: But it is extremely easy to just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10683.587s">[Graham]</a>: scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and click that I have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10688.491s">[Graham]</a>: But if what the district is seeking is like cover, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10694.035s">[Graham]</a>: You know, so if Lucas gets a concussion, like I, you have my signature that I've done something, but there's no evidence that you can point to that I actually did or didn't scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, sign my name and I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.027s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.368s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's like compliance and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10713.703s">[Graham]</a>: what we want, you know, from a requirements perspective as we think about all of this going forward, but then there's actually like, did it sink in or did it stick in any way, shape or form?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10726.752s">[Graham]</a>: And was the thing that was really important actually delivered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10732.356s">[Graham]</a>: And I would argue that when you sign your kids up for sports, that is not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10736.318s">[Graham]</a>: Like the thing you needed parents to know when they like rolled out of that sign up, it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10743.553s">[Graham]</a>: It's not the takeaway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10745.975s">[Graham]</a>: The takeaway is, wow, this system is bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10748.276s">[Graham]</a>: And it is really tedious and time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10751.619s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm glad that's over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10753.24s">[Graham]</a>: So I want to see parents be educated about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10756.923s">[Graham]</a>: And I think parents genuinely want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10759.224s">[Graham]</a>: But I think we have to do a better job of delivering that content for parents to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10763.767s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm hoping that we can address some of that when we are thinking about the build out of this parent and caregiver university, because I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10771.795s">[Graham]</a>: it's very needed for all kinds of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12414.149s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12415.55s">[Graham]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12419.488s">[Graham]</a>: There was some commentary on social media in the last week or so about whether or not the district provides DIBLS results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12430.917s">[Graham]</a>: And the general consensus of the parents was you had to ask for those results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12438.102s">[Graham]</a>: But it doesn't sound like that based on what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12440.824s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to understand clearly, like, who gets results?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12445.908s">[Graham]</a>: Does everyone get results?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12448.164s">[Graham]</a>: and if not, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12488.477s">[Graham]</a>: And so what does it mean to be at risk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12491.619s">[Graham]</a>: Like, is there like a threshold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12497.303s">[Graham]</a>: And is there a reason why we would not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12499.505s">[Graham]</a>: just give everybody their results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12501.886s">[Graham]</a>: Because basically what's happening on social media is sort of a push to go everybody as individuals to the principal to request the results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12510.45s">[Graham]</a>: And that seems like it is going to be far more complicated than if we just gave parents the results that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12593.937s">[Graham]</a>: For two to five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12604.163s">[Graham]</a>: Got it, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12606.165s">[Graham]</a>: And on this chart where we have in our packet the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12611.636s">[Graham]</a>: whether schools are title one, how many total students there are, how many reading teachers there are in the grades that the reading teachers are servicing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12620.06s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a way to add to that chart, like the number of students who are at risk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12623.882s">[Graham]</a>: Because if you just look at the numbers, there's a huge distribution of how much support is happening in buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12631.705s">[Graham]</a>: And if that's really perfectly aligned with like the number of students who need support, and then there's like even out caseloads, that makes some sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12640.904s">[Graham]</a>: but if you just look strictly at like total population it's hard to understand like are we doing are there enough reading teachers in our district and are they deployed in the right places?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12730.659s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and I think I think that breakdown would be helpful and it would be helpful next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12739.517s">[Graham]</a>: for us, like, or, and I'm not even sure that this is the right, like, exact time of year to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.542s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.982s">[Graham]</a>: Maybe, maybe it's like a look back for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.004s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.945s">[Graham]</a>: But like, whatever the thing is that we land on is like, this is when we're going to look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12754.869s">[Graham]</a>: What you would ideally see over time as this curriculum takes hold, right, and matures in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12762.315s">[Graham]</a>: And if we are being successful in our efforts to keep, to do more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12770.276s">[Graham]</a>: sort of holistic instruction at tier one, there should be fewer students over time who need these services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12777.942s">[Graham]</a>: And it would be ideal to be able to see that in this chart somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12782.926s">[Graham]</a>: So like last year we had a hundred students at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12786.79s">[Graham]</a>: This year we have 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12788.331s">[Graham]</a>: Like, so because, and I know it gets like very wild and complicated when you're talking about all the grades and all the things, but there has to, I feel like one of the things we don't do that well as a district is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12800.663s">[Graham]</a>: give people a concise way to say, are we making progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12805.025s">[Graham]</a>: So I know that we have talked a lot about moving the need to where the need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12809.667s">[Graham]</a>: And so I'm making an assumption that that's why these numbers look so strange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12813.769s">[Graham]</a>: Like if you really calculate the math, it intuitively makes sense to me based on what I know about each of those school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12821.593s">[Graham]</a>: But I want the data to actually just make that clear for everybody who just may not tune into these meetings every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12830.165s">[Graham]</a>: You know, for four or five hours every other Monday night so, so I think there's like a couple of things there from like a historical and data perspective that would be helpful to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12841.983s">[Graham]</a>: As we think about like this work and are we making progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12885.519s">[Graham]</a>: And then we know, well, I think that's a good, that's a good question, which is like, when is the right time to have some of these conversations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12893.245s">[Graham]</a>: This maybe is too early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12895.504s">[Graham]</a>: if you want to look at what's happening, like from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, if you don't yet have the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12901.447s">[Graham]</a>: The other thing that's interesting, we were looking at cohort survival models for MSBA enrollment purposes, and it was easy to see a cohort move through the ranks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12918.737s">[Graham]</a>: So you could see in this year, there were 100 kindergartners, and next year there were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12924.871s">[Graham]</a>: 99 first graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12925.691s">[Graham]</a>: And then the year after that, there were 102 second graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12928.654s">[Graham]</a>: So you could sort of see that progression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12932.356s">[Graham]</a>: And I feel like that is like a really complicated data view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12935.939s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if the tools that you're using can provide something like that, but to be able to see a cohort improve over time, I think would actually tell the story that like this all works, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12946.327s">[Graham]</a>: So we had X number of kids in kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12948.929s">[Graham]</a>: We had fewer kids in first grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12950.67s">[Graham]</a>: We had fewer kids in second grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12952.772s">[Graham]</a>: And by third grade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12954.278s">[Graham]</a>: we had even fewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12955.359s">[Graham]</a>: So that's, I think what I would want to see from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12958.701s">[Graham]</a>: And if that means that this is not the right time of year to get this presentation, it's also not my personal goal to make you come to as many school committee meetings as possible to talk about literacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12969.248s">[Graham]</a>: So if there's a better time of year for you to come where like a better story is available, like I am all ears for that because this group, this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12980.734s">[Graham]</a>: meeting has no shortage of topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12982.775s">[Graham]</a>: So we just want to make good use of your time and the data that's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13406.241s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13408.121s">[Graham]</a>: Can I just say thank you to the Council for moving quickly on this ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13413.483s">[Graham]</a>: It's really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13415.703s">[Graham]</a>: that schools have hot water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13417.304s">[Graham]</a>: I think that goes without saying, but also when you need to spend $267,000, like you need the cooperation of the Council and the Stabilization Fund to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13430.691s">[Graham]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13522.289s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to waive the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13525.052s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13589.827s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13590.748s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13592.73s">[Graham]</a>: We had a meeting back in March where we discussed a whole series of questions and those questions never quite came like back around to us so I just want to make sure that they do and I also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13608.847s">[Graham]</a>: would like to be clear about some of these questions and where we are versus where we've been because I've had a number of parents in the last couple weeks tell me we've made no progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13619.355s">[Graham]</a>: I don't actually think that's true, but I believe that that is what it looks like because we don't provide data in a way that allows people to understand what progress looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13628.385s">[Graham]</a>: So I would like to, I'm totally open to when between now and the end of December, you need to be able to provide this report, which is why I didn't put a date, a requested date on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13640.937s">[Graham]</a>: But I do think it's important for us to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13644.24s">[Graham]</a>: It's a continuing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13646.201s">[Graham]</a>: And some of these questions are really trying to get at what does solving this problem look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13652.808s">[Graham]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13653.621s">[Graham]</a>: that looks different depending on who you talk to, but I think this will help us maybe have a conversation and help the community be part of that conversation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13664.313s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Dr. Edward-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13695.327s">[Graham]</a>: Well, what I want to be able to see is if there's 100 kids on the waitlist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13699.589s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if there's 100, but if there's 100, are 99 of them enrolled elsewhere in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13705.893s">[Graham]</a>: Because I think as a community, we have always thought of solving the afterschool problem as a thing that Medford Public Schools has to do on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13714.418s">[Graham]</a>: And thanks to lots of advocacy from lots of parents, there actually are other programs now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13720.344s">[Graham]</a>: They have created other problems for us to solve, which is why I want to know, what is the size and context of the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13726.31s">[Graham]</a>: So I just want to know, if there's 100 kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13735.539s">[Graham]</a>: Are they all enrolled somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13737.944s">[Graham]</a>: Are they half enrolled somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13739.728s">[Graham]</a>: And I know that we have that data because we bused them, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13742.734s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to understand clearly what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13747.469s">[Graham]</a>: it is that we are trying to solve for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13750.55s">[Graham]</a>: And if what we're trying to solve for is transportation so that we can continue to promote other programs in our community, like everybody else has for like decades and decades, where we're just sort of starting that process, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13765.017s">[Graham]</a>: That's a different solution than continuing to sort of bump up against, is it 80 or 100 kids in a building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13772.48s">[Graham]</a>: And we keep hearing 100 is too many, but we keep saying, but we do it in one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13777.523s">[Graham]</a>: And we're like around and around the circle, which is fine if what we haven't done is agree on like what the problems are that we're trying to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13788.248s">[Graham]</a>: And I think we're just trying to make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13791.569s">[Graham]</a>: So I don't think we've been very targeted in our like solutions and maybe that's okay because it means we're trying like every which way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13799.847s">[Graham]</a>: I just would like us to be clear and to be able to see the data over time, which I don't think we've really ever been able to do all that well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13810.413s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to work with whoever, as they create the report, if there's help I can provide or I'm totally happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=0.109s">[Graham]</a>: As importantly, thank you everybody else who's here because you all are the reason why we do the work that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=7.968s">[Graham]</a>: This is a historic moment for Medford Public Schools, and it's one that we have to soak in and really take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=15.875s">[Graham]</a>: When I ran for office in 2019, which is 100 dog years ago, it seemed like part of the reason I ran is because I would go to school committee meetings, and the hard questions about what do we need and don't have, those questions never were asked, and they certainly weren't answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=34.15s">[Graham]</a>: That is one of the many reasons why I ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=37.132s">[Graham]</a>: Once I got elected and I started on the school committee, we started having budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=41.635s">[Graham]</a>: The first thing I said was, what is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=43.636s">[Graham]</a>: How does this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=44.376s">[Graham]</a>: How do we know what we need versus how do we know how much we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=48.298s">[Graham]</a>: There were a lot of blank stares in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=50.039s">[Graham]</a>: There were a lot of people who were like, what do you mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=54.102s">[Graham]</a>: I said, how do we know what we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=56.463s">[Graham]</a>: does it just always magically match every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=59.764s">[Graham]</a>: And everyone sort of said, yeah, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=63.166s">[Graham]</a>: And I said, okay, well, if you talk to the community, they talk a lot about what we don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=67.488s">[Graham]</a>: So this can't be true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=70.889s">[Graham]</a>: So from that moment on, I've been on a quest to be more intentional about describing the budget in terms of what we would need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=79.933s">[Graham]</a>: That year in the middle of the onset of COVID, we started simple and we just said to the department heads, what are three to five things you could do that would improve student outcomes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=92.125s">[Graham]</a>: How much did the list cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=95.348s">[Graham]</a>: Anybody, any guesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=97.851s">[Graham]</a>: You know, any guesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=102.566s">[Graham]</a>: not that much, but $10 million, a cool $10 million without a lot of strategic thinking, without a lot of time to really think deeply about that question because they were also in the middle of shutting down school and trying to figure out this virtual learning thing, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=118.938s">[Graham]</a>: So a cool $10 million just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=122.661s">[Graham]</a>: Ever since then, we have taken more strategic approaches to get to that same question, and it changes a little bit every year how we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=129.367s">[Graham]</a>: But the answer is always about $10 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=132.73s">[Graham]</a>: The answer of what we need and don't have is always significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=138.655s">[Graham]</a>: And it's changed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=140.017s">[Graham]</a>: So we aren't talking about needing Chromebooks for every student anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=143.159s">[Graham]</a>: We were in 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=144.981s">[Graham]</a>: That's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=146.081s">[Graham]</a>: Now we're talking about we need money to replace those Chromebooks that we bought in 2020 because it's not an option to not have technology anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=154.505s">[Graham]</a>: So as I think about this work that we're doing, I'm excited to let people be free to really think about what could improve student outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=166.789s">[Graham]</a>: What do we need that we don't have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=169.69s">[Graham]</a>: And this moment is a huge start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=174.912s">[Graham]</a>: If you were paying attention this spring, you know that the budget was bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=179.115s">[Graham]</a>: It was dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=181.116s">[Graham]</a>: The MPS administration was asked to lay out sort of what would it take to meet the city's available allocation and they laid out a devastating list of cuts and we were still 2.7 million dollars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=194.304s">[Graham]</a>: away from that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=196.786s">[Graham]</a>: So when you talk about 2.7 million more dollars, nothing is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=202.85s">[Graham]</a>: Class size, athletics, extracurriculars, buses, the arts, the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=208.613s">[Graham]</a>: 2.7 million dollars is a big, big number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=211.375s">[Graham]</a>: And that's in addition to all of the other cuts that they could lay out for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=217.336s">[Graham]</a>: I'm super grateful that my fellow finance task force members voiced their unwavering support when I said, we can't live through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=226.359s">[Graham]</a>: This is too deep for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=230.24s">[Graham]</a>: And we were able to work with the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=234.801s">[Graham]</a>: I'm grateful to every city department that ratcheted back what they wanted out of the budget so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=240.762s">[Graham]</a>: the situation at Medford Public Schools could be a little less bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=244.064s">[Graham]</a>: And that's what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=245.064s">[Graham]</a>: It was less bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=246.885s">[Graham]</a>: I'm also grateful for one-time funds because that all allowed us to do some things in a stopgap way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=254.488s">[Graham]</a>: We were able to save two literacy interventionists, four department heads, three behavior specialists, one nurse, two elementary school teachers, and a facilities maintenance budget that was a little less anemic than in years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=267.034s">[Graham]</a>: So that's what we did with one-time funds, but that's one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=270.917s">[Graham]</a>: That means that all of those things are on the chopping block again next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=277.061s">[Graham]</a>: There's no more one-time funds to fill this void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=281.684s">[Graham]</a>: So let's talk about November because that's actually a more fun thing to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=286.433s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to do two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=287.754s">[Graham]</a>: The first thing we're going to do is stabilize the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=290.416s">[Graham]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=291.857s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stop the potential of that hole that we've created with one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=299.801s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to close that gap and we're going to close it for good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=303.503s">[Graham]</a>: Those critical staff members I just talked about, we're going to put them in a position where they can continue to support our students the way that they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=311.528s">[Graham]</a>: The stabilizing money will also fund our technology replacement budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=315.251s">[Graham]</a>: It's 2024, and it's not an option to not have technology anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=320.416s">[Graham]</a>: It will also allow us to restore an administrative assistant at the McGlynn School, where we have one administrative assistant managing two school buildings and supporting two principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=328.622s">[Graham]</a>: It's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=329.863s">[Graham]</a>: And she's going to do it, and she's going to be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=332.566s">[Graham]</a>: But that is a stopgap situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=335.808s">[Graham]</a>: So we're looking forward to being able to do something to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=339.252s">[Graham]</a>: And it will also this stabilization money will ensure that we never have to find out what that $2.7 million would actually look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=347.317s">[Graham]</a>: So that's one thing we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=348.378s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stabilize the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=349.819s">[Graham]</a>: We're going to stop doing this one time thing where we don't have enough to even get by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=356.826s">[Graham]</a>: yay but as importantly we're going to invest in the future so we're going to do more than just run in place we are going to do more and the list of possibilities is long and you probably all have your own list of what you think is possible or what you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=379.442s">[Graham]</a>: would be useful and so I brought my list just to give you a flavor of what was I thinking about when I sat in those meetings and we arrived at these numbers where we were going to ask for the community to bring seven million more dollars to MPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=394.093s">[Graham]</a>: So here's a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=395.895s">[Graham]</a>: Our vocational students deserve access to the arts and AP classes and they shouldn't have to take Spanish or any other language online because the schedule is simply incompatible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=405.842s">[Graham]</a>: That is what happens today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=409.389s">[Graham]</a>: Fixing it is a huge undertaking and it's gonna change the structure of the school day and the schedule for every single student at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=416.233s">[Graham]</a>: So it's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=418.574s">[Graham]</a>: All of our students deserve more time for learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=421.475s">[Graham]</a>: We have the shortest school day around and it's time for Medford to do more than the minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=429.979s">[Graham]</a>: More students deserve access to transportation because two miles is too far to walk to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=439.184s">[Graham]</a>: It doesn't matter how old you are, that's a long walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=443.348s">[Graham]</a>: Our staff deserve investment in high quality professional development and support as they develop their craft as educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=450.976s">[Graham]</a>: Our paras deserve a living and competitive wage and so do our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.004s">[Graham]</a>: This is a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.924s">[Graham]</a>: We've made a lot of progress for our paraprofessionals, but there's so much to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=462.467s">[Graham]</a>: Our athletes, our extracurricular participants, they deserve the very best opportunities we can provide, and that starts with increasing our coaching and advisor stipends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=472.613s">[Graham]</a>: They have not been addressed in a decade or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=476.835s">[Graham]</a>: They are fractional compared to the time that our advisors and our coaches put into our students, and we need to do something about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=486.102s">[Graham]</a>: Our buildings deserve maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=489.952s">[Graham]</a>: It's the most boring thing, but it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=493.835s">[Graham]</a>: The project to replace the HVAC system at McGlynn and Andrews is $20 million alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=499.938s">[Graham]</a>: $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=501.279s">[Graham]</a>: So that project is ongoing, but $20 million will be spent on that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=507.924s">[Graham]</a>: And that's just so that those buildings can have acceptable HVAC systems, and it's not too hot to learn in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=518.67s">[Graham]</a>: just this morning I got a list of immediate repair needs that are happening that are happening across the district as we prepare for the start of school it was a cool half million dollars right there so the need across the school our buildings are all new but they're aging our buildings are new but they're 20 years old and that means their their systems are at the end of life so we have to be prepared to do something different than we've done all along<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=543.625s">[Graham]</a>: we have to maintain what we have so we don't have to do this again because I think that's critically important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=550.068s">[Graham]</a>: Certainly the Medford High School project is a bit of a separate matter than what we're talking about tonight if anyone wants to have if anyone has questions about the Medford High building project please let me know I'm happy to answer them after this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=562.013s">[Graham]</a>: So the list goes on that's my list I've probably already spent seven million dollars so I'll stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=568.376s">[Graham]</a>: And I know we all have a list, and I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=573.159s">[Graham]</a>: So when we do this in November, the next thing that happens is we start talking about now what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=580.324s">[Graham]</a>: What is the plan, and how are we going to best use this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=583.546s">[Graham]</a>: And I want to see all of you at that table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=585.867s">[Graham]</a>: That's a very public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=587.669s">[Graham]</a>: It happens on the floor, out in the open, in the light of day, so that we can hear from people about what those priorities are and what they think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=595.934s">[Graham]</a>: But first, we have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=167.756s">[Graham]</a>: Hi, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=168.356s">[Graham]</a>: I'm Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=169.797s">[Graham]</a>: I'm the vice chair of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=172.339s">[Graham]</a>: This is my fifth year on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=175.861s">[Graham]</a>: So I started January 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=178.222s">[Graham]</a>: And I am really excited about this very historic opportunity for us to do what we've been talking about for five years as we have navigated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=193.294s">[Graham]</a>: Terrible budgets for our schools and our kids and really to say to the community that we are asking the community to tell us that they value education as much as that they have told us for the last 5 budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=208.751s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm super excited about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=212.435s">[Graham]</a>: I think there's a lot of questions out out in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=216.44s">[Graham]</a>: I'm so happy that you're all here and hopefully we can answer some of those most pressing questions as we go tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=223.829s">[Graham]</a>: So I will turn it over to Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=719.974s">[Graham]</a>: start and Paul, please add to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=724.858s">[Graham]</a>: So I think there's a couple of things that we we know for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=728.68s">[Graham]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=729.021s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that in last year's budget, we relied on one time funds to prevent some of the cuts that were articulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=740.489s">[Graham]</a>: So if you were following the last budget season, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=746.934s">[Graham]</a>: The CFO and our budget, our now budget director, Jerry McHugh, was directed to make the budget lean because we knew that we were coming off of our ability to use ESSER funds, which are COVID-related relief funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=767.251s">[Graham]</a>: And we knew that the budget was going to be tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=773.366s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out a series of cuts, essentially, that were very unpopular and unfavorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=784.415s">[Graham]</a>: And they included things like two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists who work with our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=796.921s">[Graham]</a>: 1 nurse, 4 teachers, 4 department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=800.924s">[Graham]</a>: So those positions alone are worth like 1.1 million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=807.387s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out obviously more than 1.1 million dollars worth of cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=812.891s">[Graham]</a>: He laid out, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.3 million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=817.853s">[Graham]</a>: In cuts, some of the cuts actually happened, but thanks to the finance task force working with me and the mayor, we were able to get agreement that we would use some 1 time funds from the city in order to make the whole, like, not so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=838.959s">[Graham]</a>: So, the, the cuts that Jerry laid out in terms of what the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=843.3s">[Graham]</a>: Possibilities were were sort of deep and devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=846.881s">[Graham]</a>: And he was also articulating at that time that there was still $2.7 million of a gap between what the city thought the budget could possibly be and what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=861.954s">[Graham]</a>: we felt like was needed to avoid cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=864.856s">[Graham]</a>: So all the positions that he talked about lost 2.7 million more dollars were on the table in cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=873.241s">[Graham]</a>: We saved many of those cuts from based on some of the one-time funds and really at the expense of many other city departments who had to go back and slim back their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=885.428s">[Graham]</a>: And that's a recurring theme in Medford where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=889.19s">[Graham]</a>: the school costs are accelerating I would say more quickly than sort of anywhere else in the city's budget and what I've seen in the last five years is that when something more than two and a half percent is able to come to the schools it's at the expense of another city department and there's there's just no more for the city departments to cut or give it's why the DPW<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=914.369s">[Graham]</a>: Is struggling to handle our roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=918.173s">[Graham]</a>: It's why we almost didn't have Saturdays in the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=922.477s">[Graham]</a>: Like, all of those things come because there's just the pie is only so big for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=927.561s">[Graham]</a>: And there's only so much that we can do to direct money to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=931.785s">[Graham]</a>: And it is happening at the expense of all the other things that we would like to see in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=936.93s">[Graham]</a>: So this year we were able to plug part of the whole with one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=942.834s">[Graham]</a>: It was about $1.75 million in one-time funds and additional money that came at the expense of other city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=952.34s">[Graham]</a>: So what we know for sure is that that $1.75 million is not available next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=959.505s">[Graham]</a>: That's the sort of very definition of one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=962.347s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that there will be cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=967.029s">[Graham]</a>: If these overrides don't pass, because there, there just is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=971.831s">[Graham]</a>: Nowhere else to to collect that money from so we certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=976.493s">[Graham]</a>: Could imagine that we might get a 2 and a half percent increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=981.634s">[Graham]</a>: Like, 90, something percent of our costs are fixed either by contract or by things like our utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=989.434s">[Graham]</a>: They're all accelerating faster than 2 and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=992.636s">[Graham]</a>: So there's just no, there's no wiggle room there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=994.597s">[Graham]</a>: There's, there's no room to say, but we want to keep these extra people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=998.178s">[Graham]</a>: So we know that that will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1000.88s">[Graham]</a>: What exact positions are very much that's sort of the ugly question we will grapple with if we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1007.503s">[Graham]</a>: Um, don't see these override succeed and so is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1010.724s">[Graham]</a>: 1 nurse or 2 nurses is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1013.485s">[Graham]</a>: 2 behavior specialists or 3, all of those would be questions we'd be sort of asking and answering in the next budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1020.748s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but we also, we know that we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1025.069s">[Graham]</a>: are not doing things today that we have to do, like maintain our technology, whether that's Chromebooks, laptops for teachers, any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1035.138s">[Graham]</a>: We know we're not doing that today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1037.32s">[Graham]</a>: And if we don't do that next year, we will no longer have technology for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1043.365s">[Graham]</a>: And as we look to what we need to educate students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1048.462s">[Graham]</a>: Technology is on the must have list so that means that that money that half 1Million dollars that we need for technology next year would have to come from somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1057.97s">[Graham]</a>: So there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1059.752s">[Graham]</a>: In our budget, 80 ish, 85% of our costs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1065.257s">[Graham]</a>: For staff, so when you talk about cutting the budget, there's just very little that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1072.782s">[Graham]</a>: discretionary in any way, unless you consider staff discretionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1077.064s">[Graham]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1078.804s">[Graham]</a>: But we would be looking at some very, very difficult decisions were it to come to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1085.347s">[Graham]</a>: And we've done that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1087.668s">[Graham]</a>: And it's ugly each and every time we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1093.09s">[Graham]</a>: And we are the only city department since I have started that has said goodbye to humans who work in our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1100.233s">[Graham]</a>: So other departments have seen cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1102.934s">[Graham]</a>: They've seen sort of flatlining, but we have said goodbye to people who work in our district in service to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1111.839s">[Graham]</a>: And there would be more of that before there would be less if the overpits don't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1476.006s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so a couple of things that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1479.848s">[Graham]</a>: Eliminate this year, our director of data reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1485.53s">[Graham]</a>: Was eliminated by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1490.365s">[Graham]</a>: Six, five or six, I'm not remembering exactly, administrative assistant positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1496.984s">[Graham]</a>: were eliminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1499.045s">[Graham]</a>: There's at least one of them is on high on my list personally to come back because the McGlynn complex is working with one administrative assistant right now for a thousand kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1511.873s">[Graham]</a>: That's not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1514.714s">[Graham]</a>: That is a huge, it's a huge ask and a big lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1518.297s">[Graham]</a>: So there are some administrative assistant positions that we could look at to say what needs to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1526.437s">[Graham]</a>: Literacy interventionists, we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1530.299s">[Graham]</a>: We're able to bring, I think, 3 back into the budget, but we needed 4. we only have 2 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1536.822s">[Graham]</a>: We do have 1 open position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1539.384s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then there were, um, there ended up being 1 elimination from the administrators union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1547.73s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1551.032s">[Graham]</a>: Think that's like, super high on our list because the work has been distributed, but that would certainly be subject of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1558.538s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then there were some changes to the portfolio of, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1566.336s">[Graham]</a>: of teachers at each of our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1569.058s">[Graham]</a>: And that number change, you know, whatever, whatever we talked about in May, and then in June, and what actually transpired at the start of the year is very much a function of like how the enrollment comes through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1581.584s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think there are some classrooms that are bigger than they have historically done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1587.306s">[Graham]</a>: And we're sort of always watching those class sizes because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1593.534s">[Graham]</a>: Once you put too many kids in a classroom, it becomes incredibly hard for all the kids to get what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1599.599s">[Graham]</a>: And we would be looking at that and maybe able to return to some of those other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1605.884s">[Graham]</a>: But there's a whole bunch of other things that we've never been able to talk about doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1610.667s">[Graham]</a>: And I know that representatives from our teachers union was at, were at one of our early meetings this year asking us to address the overcrowding issues at the Roberts Elementary School specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1623.717s">[Graham]</a>: There is no more space at that school and we continue to see enrollment climb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1630.038s">[Graham]</a>: So there are other things that we are going to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1634.539s">[Graham]</a>: So they may not be about like bringing back a position that was cut, but talking about finally being able to fund a position that's always been needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1644.462s">[Graham]</a>: So that those two things are both possibilities for this when we pass this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1672.961s">[Graham]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1675.234s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of so question 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1678.796s">[Graham]</a>: Provides us an opportunity to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1681.618s">[Graham]</a>: What we should do, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1683.359s">[Graham]</a>: Like, what what have we never been able to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1685.381s">[Graham]</a>: We should do and we actually have been having this conversation in budget seasons for as long as I've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1694.307s">[Graham]</a>: And there's a shortage of good ideas about things that would benefit students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1700.013s">[Graham]</a>: But the things that are sort of, I'll say highest on the list are things like living wages for all of our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1708.901s">[Graham]</a>: And so when I say a living wage, I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1714.179s">[Graham]</a>: raising people up out of the minimum wage category, where many of our positions have existed for a really long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1722.605s">[Graham]</a>: We've made a lot of progress in moving out of that minimum wage territory, but we are not yet at what is considered a living wage for somebody who lives in this area and works in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1736.974s">[Graham]</a>: We also, and like, 1 of the biggest and most important things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1742.695s">[Graham]</a>: For our district is to finish the integration of our high school and our vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1749.176s">[Graham]</a>: So, the 2 schools used to operate completely separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1752.057s">[Graham]</a>: They were listed as 2 different schools with the Department of elementary and secondary education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1757.998s">[Graham]</a>: They were merged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1759.678s">[Graham]</a>: Some years ago, 6, 7 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1763.797s">[Graham]</a>: But the two schedules were never integrated in such a way that students could move seamlessly between the two buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1773.32s">[Graham]</a>: That's very complicated work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1776.701s">[Graham]</a>: We have been at it for a good number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1779.923s">[Graham]</a>: I think we finally are at the place where we have a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1785.284s">[Graham]</a>: And that will allow things like our vocational students to have space in their schedule to access<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1793.107s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the arts or world language, my daughter is in the vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1799.169s">[Graham]</a>: Um, now she's a 10th grader in the robotics and engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1803.93s">[Graham]</a>: She has to take Spanish in line after school to meet her world language requirement because there's no space in her schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1811.572s">[Graham]</a>: For Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1814.398s">[Graham]</a>: All of that gets fixed with changes to the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1818.601s">[Graham]</a>: And it's a very complicated set of changes because we still have to and want to preserve what makes our vocational school so unique and special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1829.367s">[Graham]</a>: We have students who come out who are halfway to licensure, who are like a year ahead of their peers coming out of high school, going into certain trades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1840.013s">[Graham]</a>: All of that requires a completely different schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1843.034s">[Graham]</a>: So the integration of the two schedules is critically important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1846.994s">[Graham]</a>: It's going to change the structure of the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1849.575s">[Graham]</a>: It's going to change the amount of time that happens in class A versus class B versus class C. And all of that contributes to, you know, reexamining as we begin negotiations with our teachers, like what the contract is, what the requirements are, and what the costs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1871.272s">[Graham]</a>: Relatedly, when you think about all the rest of the schools in the district, universally, our instructional time is at the minimum that the state allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1882.358s">[Graham]</a>: So when we think about how much time we spend educating kids and what opportunities we're able to provide them, there's no wiggle room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1892.083s">[Graham]</a>: There's probably many, many reasons why we don't call a late<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1896.897s">[Graham]</a>: For those of you who are parents and you're like, why don't we do a 2 hour delay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1900.599s">[Graham]</a>: There's actually probably many reasons, but 1 of the reasons is because we don't have 2 hours to spare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1907.043s">[Graham]</a>: So, we either have to bring the kids in for a whole day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1909.985s">[Graham]</a>: Or we're not meeting our instructional requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1912.846s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1914.627s">[Graham]</a>: Looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1916.048s">[Graham]</a>: The, the nature and structure and lengths of the school day are all things that become possible when we are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1924.115s">[Graham]</a>: Also, simultaneously talking about cutting staff, because if you think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1929.215s">[Graham]</a>: How your elementary school student moves through their day, for example, they, they have their core classes and they have their specials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1936.678s">[Graham]</a>: That whole, like, the whole dynamic might need to shift in order to be able to spend another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1942.02s">[Graham]</a>: You know, 5 minutes a day on something like math and that then may require additional specialists to be able to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1950.563s">[Graham]</a>: students in the building because every class changes so there's any number of ways that plays out in practice and we have to we obviously have to you know get with our partners in the union and sort of talk through all the nitty-gritty details of that but the way school day happens is going to change and in order for that to be possible it's very likely we're going to be asking teachers to do something different than they do today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1978.94s">[Graham]</a>: And therefore, like, we need the sort of financial space to be able to have a productive conversation about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2548.717s">[Graham]</a>: Just quickly to say yes to around the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2552.379s">[Graham]</a>: We're several years away from that question being on the table for the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2560.805s">[Graham]</a>: The money that we are required to set aside for the early stages of that project have been set aside by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2569.03s">[Graham]</a>: So in so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2571.812s">[Graham]</a>: When we talk about free cash, 1 of the things that happened back in June was an allocation of some of the free cash money, about 3M dollars to be ready for those early stages of so that is provided for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2584.615s">[Graham]</a>: But there's many steps that will go through before we get to a point of being being in a position to ask about that debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2593.457s">[Graham]</a>: 1 of the things that's very interesting, there's lots of documentation on the school building committee website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2599.061s">[Graham]</a>: If you want to know more about that project, all of the deliverables that we have submitted are out there with the exception of some of our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2608.649s">[Graham]</a>: Some of our enrollment projection information, and I found that part of the exercise very enlightening because they did ask us to talk about future development and we talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2618.396s">[Graham]</a>: You know, and we talked about in reference in partnership with the city, things like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2622.378s">[Graham]</a>: Projects in Medford square in project over the air rights in Wellington and some of the bigger sort of coming attractions and I will follow up with the communications director to make sure that those documents get out there because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2636.586s">[Graham]</a>: I think where they landed is pretty digestible to the public and just to understand where that falls in relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2644.77s">[Graham]</a>: to some of these plans that we're talking about here from a development perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2648.571s">[Graham]</a>: They're real, they're coming, there's RFPs going out and all that good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2651.912s">[Graham]</a>: But also, what effect and impact does that have on the size of the eventual Medford High School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2673.786s">[Graham]</a>: Sure, we so we're in the very 1st stage of the project, which is called the eligibility phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2681.577s">[Graham]</a>: Um, our, our eligibility phase started on May 1st and by July 10th, all of our deliverables were in, which usually takes about 6 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2690.669s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2691.77s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we crushed through that in about 2 and a half months instead of 6. and so we are waiting now for, um, to finalize the process with MSBA, where we agree on how big of a population of students we're building a building for once that happens and they get back with us after they've done their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2713.416s">[Graham]</a>: will move into the next phase, which is where we would hire the owner's project manager and ultimately the architect who will help conduct the feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2724.904s">[Graham]</a>: So that's where that feasibility study money comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2727.946s">[Graham]</a>: The feasibility study has to be completed in order to then have any sort of a spec that would be able to go out to debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2735.831s">[Graham]</a>: So it's not five to seven years away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2738.033s">[Graham]</a>: I hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2740.114s">[Graham]</a>: We have students in the building to 7 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2744.056s">[Graham]</a>: I certainly am pushing for that, but we're probably a couple years down the road before a debt exclusion before we're ready to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4130.64s">[Graham]</a>: If you have high school students, you know that this is desperately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4134.482s">[Graham]</a>: A long time coming, like I said earlier, my daughter is in the robotics and engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4143.066s">[Graham]</a>: She takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4144.947s">[Graham]</a>: There's no opportunity for her to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4147.768s">[Graham]</a>: An art class, which is the other sort of half of her brain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4150.429s">[Graham]</a>: So she struggles with that, but she takes Spanish online because there's no space in her schedule to take a language, which is a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4158.512s">[Graham]</a>: And certainly, if you are thinking about pursuing a 4 year college experience after high school, they want to know that you have some sort of full language for some number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4170.356s">[Graham]</a>: So, to answer the question, there is the changing the schedule is a huge undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4176.158s">[Graham]</a>: We are doing everything we can on the administrative side to be as ready as we can possibly be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4185.561s">[Graham]</a>: Before we are able to sort of have this productive conversation with with our teachers union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4191.857s">[Graham]</a>: which hopefully can happen quickly once these questions are successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4196.278s">[Graham]</a>: So there are some sort of like, I'll call them drop dead dates in the mix, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4201.58s">[Graham]</a>: So the high school students have to pick their schedule by like, say mid April, which would mean if you sort of back up from there, the offering and the new schedule would have to be ready in enough time to like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4219.426s">[Graham]</a>: Build everything so that students could pick their schedule in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4223.25s">[Graham]</a>: So we really are looking at a very tight window, but the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4230.699s">[Graham]</a>: Is working really hard to make this a reality for next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4234.943s">[Graham]</a>: I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4237.159s">[Graham]</a>: I think they think it's a huge amount of work and I think they are concerned about the viability of getting to that, that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4244.286s">[Graham]</a>: What I have said is we can't wait another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4247.269s">[Graham]</a>: Another class of kids can't wait for this to go another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4252.854s">[Graham]</a>: So, I personally am really pushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4256.877s">[Graham]</a>: that this override passes, obviously we will have the opportunity to invest some resource in making this a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4264.002s">[Graham]</a>: And obviously we have to go through the negotiating process and we are talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4271.707s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sure the teachers union is talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4274.889s">[Graham]</a>: I want those conversations to be collaborative and productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4279.452s">[Graham]</a>: And in saying that, that also means everybody's sort of ready and prepared for the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4285.136s">[Graham]</a>: And so part of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4287.137s">[Graham]</a>: I'm asking of the school administration is that they get ready and prepared about all the things that have to happen to make the schedule a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4294.682s">[Graham]</a>: But I am very hopeful that if these pass, we will see maybe not like the final, final, final change by fall of next year, but hopefully pretty darn close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4307.69s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully next year your students won't have to take a foreign language online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4314.178s">[Graham]</a>: But there's a lot of work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4317.24s">[Graham]</a>: Everybody knows that there's a lot of work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4319.481s">[Graham]</a>: And I think if you talk to anybody, any high school student, if you talk to parents of high school students, if you talk to teachers in the high school, like we've sort of all known this has to happen for any number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4334.471s">[Graham]</a>: And the time is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4337.373s">[Graham]</a>: So we're going to push on that as best we can to make that a reality for fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4353.926s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4508.035s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4509.576s">[Graham]</a>: Actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4511.053s">[Graham]</a>: with Paul's help, hopped in the time machine and went back through our school budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4519.159s">[Graham]</a>: And to see like, do we, you know, to answer the question, like, do we defund the schools ever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4524.643s">[Graham]</a>: And the answer is basically no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4527.705s">[Graham]</a>: So there are years where we've flatlined the budget of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4531.208s">[Graham]</a>: So like we did for fiscal year 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4533.289s">[Graham]</a>: So we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4536.463s">[Graham]</a>: gave the schools the same exact appropriation for FY21 as they had for FY20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4542.308s">[Graham]</a>: That is effectively a cut in order to make that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4545.511s">[Graham]</a>: We laid off staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4547.212s">[Graham]</a>: So I would call that a flat line, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4549.194s">[Graham]</a>: Like it's effectively a cut, but the dollars from last year and the dollars from this year are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4554.198s">[Graham]</a>: So we have done that, and we have not invested enough, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4560.061s">[Graham]</a>: In our school budget to grow the budget enough to sort of prevent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4566.449s">[Graham]</a>: But I had to go back to, like, the 80s to see a year where the number for this year was lower than the number for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4576.04s">[Graham]</a>: And I think that was, like, in the middle of the financial crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4579.364s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4580.695s">[Graham]</a>: Medford certainly does have some history of flatlining the budget or for under investing, but we really don't have a history of defunding the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4592.339s">[Graham]</a>: So that is what would have to happen to, like, move this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4596.74s">[Graham]</a>: We would have to be making choices to defund the school budget a year from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4602.402s">[Graham]</a>: That is not why I do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4605.163s">[Graham]</a>: That is not why people pour their heart and their soul into helping lead our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4611.526s">[Graham]</a>: I'm a no on any proposal that defunds our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4616.588s">[Graham]</a>: I think the council, without exception, would also not agree to defund our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4622.551s">[Graham]</a>: So even if it were proposed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4625.092s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think there's any support for that and I also don't think having worked with the council and the mayor on the finance task force that anybody even wants to entertain that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4637.202s">[Graham]</a>: The entire premise of this is to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4639.604s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4641.906s">[Graham]</a>: just maybe rest assured that we don't have even a history of doing this sort of scary thing that is legally possible, but would require an inordinate amount of support to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4654.458s">[Graham]</a>: And there is no support for that concept here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4890.751s">[Graham]</a>: Zach, the only thing I would say is the city put out earlier today a graphic about how we've used ARPA dollars, which I think has been a question that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4903.654s">[Graham]</a>: So check out the city's Facebook page or website to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4909.515s">[Graham]</a>: We have a sort of a deeper dive into question 7 and 8 that are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4915.16s">[Graham]</a>: That is now done sort of almost hot off the presses and I think we can get that out in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4922.066s">[Graham]</a>: So be on the lookout for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4924.628s">[Graham]</a>: Where I'm happy to answer questions offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4929.332s">[Graham]</a>: I know many of you please don't hesitate to reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4933.519s">[Graham]</a>: This is such a significant priority for me over the next couple of weeks, because it sets the stage for what the rest of this year becomes, and frankly, for what the future for our students becomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4949.328s">[Graham]</a>: So it's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4951.269s">[Graham]</a>: I'm happy to answer questions any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4954.57s">[Graham]</a>: I will see maybe some of you at Walking Wednesday tomorrow at the Roberts, but grab me any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4963.597s">[Graham]</a>: You have a question, happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5139.796s">[Graham]</a>: Thanks everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=30.857s">[Graham]</a>: Let me just one second to find the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=70.638s">[Graham]</a>: That was open apparently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=71.939s">[Graham]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=82.805s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=85.167s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to read the meeting notice so we can get started and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=145.452s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=147.412s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=149.032s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=150.753s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=151.873s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.253s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=153.953s">[Graham]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=154.333s">[Graham]</a>: So three present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=157.995s">[Graham]</a>: Our agenda today is really to kick off the strategic and capital planning process, particularly with a focus on the capital planning component, which is based on the policy that we passed unanimously last spring to lay out a series of steps for capital planning that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=177.944s">[Graham]</a>: line up and to the best of our ability, don't overlap budget season because that becomes too many things at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=187.27s">[Graham]</a>: So the goal here is for us to do this capital planning work in advance of the sort of operating budget conversation so that A, we can feed that both to the mayor and to the council in advance of budget season, but also so that we're not sort of stepping on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=207.045s">[Graham]</a>: The need for, you know, extra meetings and things like that, um, for all of our staff, uh, for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.25s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=213.49s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have a meeting scheduled today and then we have a meeting scheduled in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=217.894s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we may or may not need both meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=221.117s">[Graham]</a>: We'll sort of see how it goes today, but the goal for us is to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=226.894s">[Graham]</a>: take last year's capital plan and go through it together and make some updates to it to the best of our knowledge, as well as add potential capital projects to it that don't exist on there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=244.76s">[Graham]</a>: And we'll talk a little bit about some of the work Peter has been doing to collect that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=249.721s">[Graham]</a>: And then really the other thing for us to do will be ultimately to come up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=256.263s">[Graham]</a>: an attempt at prioritization of some kind for the whole giant list, um, so that we can clearly identify that for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=265.287s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then ultimately, um, to the mayor and the council and also, um, identify if there are projects that are potentially eligible for community preservation at, um, act funding, um, whether there's projects that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=282.578s">[Graham]</a>: eligible to be included in that school spending, yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=285.839s">[Graham]</a>: And then, you know, sort of all other and to start to have an ongoing process, which has been a little bit haphazard over the last couple of years, or really maybe forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=298.744s">[Graham]</a>: But certainly, that it's been a thing that has been a work in progress for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=303.765s">[Graham]</a>: So really trying to get a more stringent process in place that aligns with that policy is sort of where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=310.607s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=316.844s">[Graham]</a>: I am going to pull up a copy of Our Last capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=330.031s">[Graham]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=379.292s">[Graham]</a>: This is where I will note my extreme dislike of Google Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=384.033s">[Graham]</a>: So give me just one more second and we'll find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=392.596s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=393.176s">[Graham]</a>: I think I found it at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=394.837s">[Graham]</a>: OK, found it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=397.398s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=399.638s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=403.665s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so the first thing I thought we would do is just refresh everyone's memory about what, um, the capital plan looks like as it existed last year when we met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=418.274s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we can talk a little bit about, um, where we are with some of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=424.638s">[Graham]</a>: Can you all see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=436.65s">[Graham]</a>: better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=442.956s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=446.86s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so this is the capital plan as of the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=451.865s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about all of these projects in our capital planning meeting and then this ultimately is also the capital plan that was submitted to MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=460.874s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so it contained the projects, uh, that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=466.018s">[Graham]</a>: We knew about or we're planning for last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=468.82s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so let's just sort of go from top to bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=472.804s">[Graham]</a>: So the first three projects are led light replacement projects, um, for Brooks, Missittuck and Medford high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=480.289s">[Graham]</a>: Um, those are, um, at the time we said they were planned for FYI 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=489.11s">[Graham]</a>: And the way this works, my understanding is that it's on-bill financing through National Grid, and that we can, that these projects are in progress, and there's a, like, five-year payment cycle to do all of this work, because it contributes to energy savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=510.136s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the first three here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=511.776s">[Graham]</a>: That's these first three rows right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=517.447s">[Graham]</a>: Um, some other projects that, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=522.168s">[Graham]</a>: Sort of shifting gears, we, we made sure we're on the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=525.569s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have this, um, solar roof and battery project at the Andrews, which is actually a city sponsored project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=536.732s">[Graham]</a>: And it has been in the works for quite some time, um, because it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=542.934s">[Graham]</a>: being completed by the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=545.937s">[Graham]</a>: We don't have a whole lot of information about it and we might need to, perhaps at the next meeting, invite Alicia Hunt or others to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=555.367s">[Graham]</a>: But there were multiple parts of this project at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=560.272s">[Graham]</a>: There was putting solar on the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=562.694s">[Graham]</a>: putting solar batteries in place, and all of that was to help the Andrews Middle School become like an emergency shelter sort of resilience hub for the city, which lacks that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=580.139s">[Graham]</a>: I don't have a tremendous amount of information about that, but that's what that one was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=583.059s">[Graham]</a>: Our HVAC replacement project is listed here as well for both McGlynn and Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=593.332s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we also then are sort of looking forward to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=599.355s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we will need to do roof rebuilds for McGlynn Elementary, Brooks, Missittuc and Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=607.138s">[Graham]</a>: So all of those schools are sort of at the stage where we need to begin watching, um, roof replacement needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=614.26s">[Graham]</a>: The Andrews has already been replaced as part of, um, that product, the solar roof and battery projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=619.942s">[Graham]</a>: So that updates to the roof had to be done before the solar, um, could even be viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=625.444s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=629.888s">[Graham]</a>: As we talk about HVAC, we know that we will also have HVAC maintenance and replacement work to do at some point in the future around for Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts because all of those systems are as old as the Andrews and McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=646.605s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and, uh, you know, we will, uh, be looking at that and I'll talk, I'll mention recommissioning in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=654.252s">[Graham]</a>: Um, we have, um, some district wide security upgrades on the next, um, on the next row here, uh, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=664.08s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we do have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=668.595s">[Graham]</a>: Playground renovations potentially at our other three middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=672.819s">[Graham]</a>: So I think everyone knows how amazing the work at the McGlynn was the good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=681.126s">[Graham]</a>: You know, the good thing about that project is that it has really solved a whole host of issues at the McGlynn but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=691.155s">[Graham]</a>: The McGlynn space is so unique, there's very little that you could sort of envision lifting up and putting in place in some of our other school buildings because the other school buildings just simply don't have playgrounds sized like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=705.37s">[Graham]</a>: So there is some things to think about from a playground innovation perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=712.137s">[Graham]</a>: We also have on this list a front stairwell replacement project, ADA accessibility improvements and gutters for the Curtis Tufts building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=721.961s">[Graham]</a>: We have fire pump control work for McGlynn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=728.584s">[Graham]</a>: We have the Brooks hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=730.405s">[Graham]</a>: This actually update here has been approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=743.766s">[Graham]</a>: in September, I guess it was October, October 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=748.269s">[Graham]</a>: So that work is in progress now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=752.012s">[Graham]</a>: So that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=755.094s">[Graham]</a>: We have also on this list, we have parking lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews Complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=761.459s">[Graham]</a>: We have drainage at the field at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=764.861s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=792.869s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=795.535s">[Graham]</a>: And then we have a project to replace the field flashing behind the brick at the McGlynn Elementary that causes rain in the kindergarten classrooms when it is driving sideways rain apparently is the like factor there that sort of causes that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=816.345s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then we also have, uh, we also put on the list, um, the front Plaza, uh, settling at the McGlynn and the Andrews, um, and some, uh, potential remediation for ADA compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=831.038s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so that was everything on our list, um, as of June of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=836.763s">[Graham]</a>: Any questions about that so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=849.911s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so the next piece of this is to start to identify, are there other projects that need to be placed on this list that aren't here yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=863.102s">[Graham]</a>: And Dr. Cushing and I met a month or so ago and we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=870.962s">[Graham]</a>: uh, efforts, um, which are consistent with the policy that we pass to make sure that our building leaders and all the buildings, um, participated in this process, um, by, uh, submitting any of their capital needs to us, um, via our new operations hero, um, ticketing system for maintenance and, um, custodial services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=895.021s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, Dr. Cushing put out a memo and a call to the team to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=902.047s">[Graham]</a>: collect input so that we could add to this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=906.034s">[Graham]</a>: And I will ask him to tell us how that went and what he has to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1026.616s">[Graham]</a>: It's the motor, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1133.982s">[Graham]</a>: So, Peter, is the request at all schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1141.564s">[Graham]</a>: And the grant is specific to the McLean MHS, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.525s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.725s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1144.945s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1145.365s">[Graham]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1196.702s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so we have $1.9 million as a cost estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1201.926s">[Graham]</a>: Is that does that include locks soup to nuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1207.95s">[Graham]</a>: That includes everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1209.151s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1210.2s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1211.701s">[Graham]</a>: And the grant funding did not come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1213.741s">[Graham]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1252.599s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1314.813s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1319.477s">[Graham]</a>: So Peter, the new things that you, I just want to make sure that I got them as you were talking because that's first I was listening and then I was like, oh wait, I'm the note taker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1327.762s">[Graham]</a>: I should start writing some things down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1329.263s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanted to make sure I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1332.045s">[Graham]</a>: So with the bike racks, the door sweeps, the freight elevator motor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1336.548s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1340.458s">[Graham]</a>: Did I miss anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1477.035s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Cushing, when you said it's included in the HVAC project, do you mean just at McGlynn and Andrews?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1527.872s">[Graham]</a>: Sorry, I'm just going to make some notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1530.074s">[Graham]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1615.438s">[Graham]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1617.439s">[Graham]</a>: So Peter, for that project, is the estimate still $20,000, or is it something different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1680.356s">[Graham]</a>: So remember, Reinfeld, the other thing that is that is being actively bundled with the HVAC project is this recommissioning process that we've talked about a couple of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1693.688s">[Graham]</a>: So that is something that is being bundled in with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1697.01s">[Graham]</a>: And what what recommissioning is going to tell us is how much light do we have left on the roof?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1704.457s">[Graham]</a>: how much life do we have left in the HVAC system and those kinds of things, as well as like smaller, easier things to address and fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1712.1s">[Graham]</a>: So the team was working on a proposal for that piece of the work around recommissioning for all of the buildings outside of McGlynn and Andrews, except for MHFs and Curtis Tufts, so Brooks, Missituck, Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1730.174s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and that would be included in that work and in that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1733.677s">[Graham]</a>: I think from a city perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1736.919s">[Graham]</a>: The, I think the mayor and the council broadly know that the HVAC replacement is going to cost $20M.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1742.604s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the exact costs I think are still very much being refined and defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1750.089s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so the funding source of that in terms of how it'll be paid for, I think still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1755.635s">[Graham]</a>: technically uncommitted because we're just not like ready to do that, to take that step just yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1763.58s">[Graham]</a>: And so I think the one question is like what really should be bundled in there when it comes to like the networked closets and the roof placements, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1775.268s">[Graham]</a>: So certainly if you're going to, I think that's a question for us and maybe a question to ask Alicia if we are able to have her join us next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1785.655s">[Graham]</a>: Is really to think about if we're thinking about McGlynn and McGlynn complex and Andrews, um, we should be thinking about all of these parts as part of that bid, um, where the other schools, Brooks, Mr. Chuck Roberts may need to be in a subsequent planned round where, um, we do the recommissioning first and then it sort of leads us from a priority perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1815.523s">[Graham]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1816.544s">[Graham]</a>: That makes perfect sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1818.205s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1819.746s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm just trying to Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1831.348s">[Graham]</a>: Peter, has the roof been officially deemed as part of the scope for the McGlynn, or not yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2197.972s">[Graham]</a>: On the topic of hot water heaters, do we have other hot water heaters that are in need of replacement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2205.931s">[Graham]</a>: So end of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2207.332s">[Graham]</a>: I thought this was the last one to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2537.344s">[Graham]</a>: Members, so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2640.583s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, let's do that another time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2642.224s">[Graham]</a>: Let's just worry about the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2655.436s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so as you've been talking, what I've been trying to do is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2660.934s">[Graham]</a>: Um, let's create some buckets here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2662.935s">[Graham]</a>: Um, certainly the top bucket is the stuff that's in progress and and funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2667.737s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and so the HVAC project is up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2671.439s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, exactly how it's funded, how it will be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2675.7s">[Graham]</a>: I don't think we know that yet, but we do know that it's on the radar and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2681.923s">[Graham]</a>: You know, being planned for so that's everything up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2685.546s">[Graham]</a>: The Brooks hot water heater is I did move that up here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2688.708s">[Graham]</a>: So that's this top piece of, like, here's what's in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2692.551s">[Graham]</a>: And moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2695.965s">[Graham]</a>: down here is all the the rest of it i guess i would say i would call it and i grouped these three things um the roof rebuild the networked closet mini split replacements and the recommissioning assessment i put that on here as its own line item as the things that um are not committed yet but have been talked about as sort of part and parcel to that um that larger h back project so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2724.443s">[Graham]</a>: I will work with Peter and Alicia to determine between now and our next meeting, can those things move above the line and be bundled, or is there something else that has to happen for that to be effective, or does it have to come into the rest of the list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2743.232s">[Graham]</a>: That is maybe a different grouping than this next group, which based on what we were talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2753.044s">[Graham]</a>: Sounded to me like the most urgent imminent things that we would be talking about prioritizing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2763.234s">[Graham]</a>: And then the last grouping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2765.885s">[Graham]</a>: Is the things to plan for future many of which all of this stuff in particular is to be validated during recommissioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2773.933s">[Graham]</a>: So not ready to do it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2777.016s">[Graham]</a>: I did put district wide security upgrades down here for next year based on the feedback about the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2785.121s">[Graham]</a>: The playground renovations are down here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2788.582s">[Graham]</a>: They're on the radar parking lot, parking lot paving, and then the ADA plaza remediation, the settling remediation, and the district-wide electrification enablement assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2804.347s">[Graham]</a>: I guess the first question, member Rousseau, member Reinfeld, do any of the things on this bottom chunk belong in the middle as we should be doing this this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2846.223s">[Graham]</a>: Well, Dr. Cushing, do you have a sense of the scope of this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2934.038s">[Graham]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2936.59s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, can we maybe take a to-do to talk to Paul Riggi about that to get a better assessment of what we might be looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3031.486s">[Graham]</a>: Because the question is, can that be bundled or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3036.427s">[Graham]</a>: So by the time we have our next meeting, I think we can answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3040.768s">[Graham]</a>: And I will invite Alicia as well to join us if she would like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3046.489s">[Graham]</a>: But I will try to get the answer in the meantime anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3051.13s">[Graham]</a>: So maybe more to come on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3083.631s">[Graham]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3091.798s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3092.658s">[Graham]</a>: The other two items that were in this like near range situation were the door sweeps, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3101.926s">[Graham]</a>: And if you had any sense of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3105.489s">[Graham]</a>: That number is and the other 1 is about the drainage at the Brooks field and I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3117.051s">[Graham]</a>: I will mention that when that field was put in, we were promised that maintenance would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3121.334s">[Graham]</a>: So I actually am going to be critical about that, that we were promised that that would happen, and it didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3128.879s">[Graham]</a>: We also were imminently promised that the drainage was going to be fixed, and it hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3133.342s">[Graham]</a>: And my kids are in high school and eighth grade now, and they were in third grade at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3139.606s">[Graham]</a>: So we do have to get back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3146.272s">[Graham]</a>: I'm just trying to look through my email because John may have sent me something about that, but Peter, I will let you answer as well about the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3177.023s">[Graham]</a>: The issue at the Brooks is the hill and the water comes like it sort of runs down the hill and spills onto the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3213.677s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3317.45s">[Graham]</a>: So that would be, I think, may be helpful for our next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3321.011s">[Graham]</a>: And then I was just looking in my email to see if I ever got<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3327.485s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, a quote from John about the drainage project, and I'm not seeing it, but I don't know, Peter, you have that or if we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3458.52s">[Graham]</a>: So I just separated that into two lines so that we have both of them on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3469.643s">[Graham]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3471.724s">[Graham]</a>: So I think this middle group is the group that we, a, we need to try to get some better pricing to understand where these projects are at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3480.927s">[Graham]</a>: And then B, um, we'll ultimately need to sort of prioritize and recommend, um, the go forward path on in the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3493.431s">[Graham]</a>: Does that sound right to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3494.852s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anything else that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3501.502s">[Graham]</a>: listed here that should move up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3586.306s">[Graham]</a>: I just put in maybe we can circle back and talk about that next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3662.923s">[Graham]</a>: Well, there's four pillars that are eligible for CPC funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3669.306s">[Graham]</a>: One of them is affordable housing, so that broadly doesn't apply to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3673.556s">[Graham]</a>: Um, then there's like historic restoration, open space, and I'm forgetting the fourth tier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3683.726s">[Graham]</a>: I think it's recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3716.167s">[Graham]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3719.236s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so members, so I think this spreadsheet actually gets us to all of those places just in a different version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3729.59s">[Graham]</a>: If we can add this net school spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3733.237s">[Graham]</a>: piece on and I think Noel that may be something that I can work with you on offline to tag these as whether or not they are sort of inclusive in that school spending or excluded from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3753.407s">[Graham]</a>: So we can do that before the next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3802.805s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, so I will share this with Noel after we're done here and ask that that be added to before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3821.874s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other projects that you all have on your mind that haven't made this list just yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3903.178s">[Graham]</a>: I'll do dinner in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3905.539s">[Graham]</a>: I think we can certainly update this once we hear from the afterschool program, if there's a capital need there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3912.821s">[Graham]</a>: Or it might just be building in grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3922.104s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3923.365s">[Graham]</a>: Hopefully not a capital need, but I hope not, but it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3929.366s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3931.287s">[Graham]</a>: So we can circle back to that at our next meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3936.348s">[Graham]</a>: Is there anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3983.325s">[Graham]</a>: So I think maybe we can get some details about the like evolving scope of that project, which sounds like it's everything in the kitchen sink in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3991.728s">[Graham]</a>: Um, and then, um, we can, we can update it if necessary, but, um, I think the other, you know, the recommissioning process will also tell us whether that's an option for, um, the outside buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4049.623s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4100.003s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah, and I think the other thing that is the consideration when we get to feasibility is do the administrative offices stay at the high school or do they get relocated and to a place like Curtis Tufts is always sort of something that is a possibility as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4121.62s">[Graham]</a>: Because the administrative offices, if I'm remembering correctly, generally are not reimbursable under MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4127.505s">[Graham]</a>: So to rebuild the administrative offices, we would have to pay in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4132.19s">[Graham]</a>: So that may be a good way to change the use of that space instead of shutting it down completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4142.739s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4151.064s">[Graham]</a>: Any other changes that people think we should make this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4161.018s">[Graham]</a>: The agenda for our next meeting is exactly the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4165.4s">[Graham]</a>: It's to continue this conversation so that we can agree amongst this group what we're going to recommend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4175.484s">[Graham]</a>: And then that will go to a committee of the whole in December, where we will walk through what this is and what is on here and formalize a recommendation from the school committee that will be shared with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4189.13s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor and obviously may will be there, but the mayor and the council in terms of funding needs and so that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4198.894s">[Graham]</a>: At a capital level, we can plan accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4203.515s">[Graham]</a>: So, I think we can make a motion to continue this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4207.037s">[Graham]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4213.919s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4217.779s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to continue the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4229.482s">[Graham]</a>: It's the 19th of November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4231.502s">[Graham]</a>: The 19th of November, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.904s">[Graham]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4241.225s">[Graham]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4243.045s">[Graham]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4244.105s">[Graham]</a>: There's a motion on the floor to continue the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4247.156s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4248.736s">[Graham]</a>: Second by Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4251.677s">[Graham]</a>: I will take a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4252.798s">[Graham]</a>: So Member Roussel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4254.498s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4255.658s">[Graham]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4256.959s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4257.779s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4258.359s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4259.46s">[Graham]</a>: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4262.24s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is continued until November 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.623s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.469s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.809s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of quick notes for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=15.313s">[Graham]</a>: We had our first strategic capital planning meeting around this capital plan specifically last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=23.819s">[Graham]</a>: We have another meeting scheduled for November 19th to finish the draft of the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=31.545s">[Graham]</a>: And after that in December, we will have a committee of the whole scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=36.449s">[Graham]</a>: All of those meetings are Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=38.89s">[Graham]</a>: And we in December will have a capital plan for this group to work through, ask questions about and prioritize so that we can give direction to the district about any CPC funding we want to direct the district to apply for to the mayor and the council about the immediate capital needs and the upcoming capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.144s">[Graham]</a>: etcetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.644s">[Graham]</a>: So, there we had a good productive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=65.507s">[Graham]</a>: It started with the input of the building principles across the district to identify some of those projects that were maybe not otherwise listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=75.936s">[Graham]</a>: So, we've updated the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=77.577s">[Graham]</a>: There are a number of capital projects in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=79.859s">[Graham]</a>: So, those those are noted as well and there's a huge number of upcoming capital needs, not the least of which is the HVAC<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=88.146s">[Graham]</a>: project at McGlynn and Andrews, but all of that is being sort of packaged up as part of the policy that we passed last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=94.911s">[Graham]</a>: And we will be ready to share in a committee of the whole in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=100.676s">[Graham]</a>: So right on schedule with our with our timeline so that that does not interfere with our typical budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=108.361s">[Graham]</a>: Whether that interferes with other supplemental appropriation budgets is sort of a one-time thing for us to consider maybe this year, but generally speaking, I think we're on a good track to not overlap the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=120.732s">[Graham]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=122.694s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1866.803s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1868.384s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know if this is a question for the folks on Zoom, but I was curious how many filling stations we would be eligible for in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1878.527s">[Graham]</a>: Is it per number of students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1881.148s">[Graham]</a>: Is it based on square footage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1883.409s">[Graham]</a>: How do you decide how many we would be eligible for under the grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1935.95s">[Graham]</a>: Wow, that's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1937.711s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1938.091s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the other question that I had was, are the results that we saw here unusual in any way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1947.233s">[Graham]</a>: Like my first thought was like, how do we have all this like lead in our fixtures?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1952.035s">[Graham]</a>: And I just didn't know if this was unusual in some way for us or if this is pretty common based on what you see in other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2004.508s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2005.108s">[Graham]</a>: That is just helpful context to understand because our buildings were not generally built before 1986.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2011.25s">[Graham]</a>: So is the typical remediation, I know it's different for everybody, but is the typical remediation at that point, simply replace, I'll say simply, but simply replacing the fixtures, or are there other potential things that need to happen in terms of our planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.009s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2066.47s">[Graham]</a>: And I will just note to the committee that we will put this faucet replacement remediation on the capital plan as well, just so we don't lose track of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3688.353s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3689.013s">[Graham]</a>: Hi, I'm Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3690.354s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3691.375s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3693.657s">[Graham]</a>: How, when you think about the people that are in the pipeline to be tested, how many of them are coming to Medford and do you have any timeline at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3798.025s">[Graham]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3800.618s">[Graham]</a>: A couple of other things I think just strategically, there's a lot of conversation in Medford about the huge thousand kids who are not eligible for transportation to the middle and the high schools because they live between one and two miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3814.962s">[Graham]</a>: And your bus drivers can probably tell you that traffic around Medford is a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3819.803s">[Graham]</a>: I am shocked that anybody gets to school on time at Medford High because I live a few blocks away and it's like impassable to get through there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3830.186s">[Graham]</a>: even until almost eight o'clock and school starts at like 740 or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3833.668s">[Graham]</a>: So I think the other thing that we're talking about is all of those people who are driving their kids to school, that's a hardship for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3844.674s">[Graham]</a>: It's bad for our roads and it would be far more efficient to put those kids on a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3850.097s">[Graham]</a>: We obviously don't have the money to do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3853.56s">[Graham]</a>: But if that is to change like we I think we could be in a position that when we go out to bid we would be looking for additional buses and I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3865.905s">[Graham]</a>: I would be interested to know from you all how we can help the bus driver shortage situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3872.25s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not sure there's much we can do, but if there is something we can do, please let us know because it's really important that kids get to school on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3880.555s">[Graham]</a>: And if the bus is late, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3883.257s">[Graham]</a>: If their parents can't drive them and they're walking two miles, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3887.901s">[Graham]</a>: So I wanna make sure that we're doing what we can to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3891.863s">[Graham]</a>: you all as you think about getting additional drivers here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3895.764s">[Graham]</a>: The other comment I did have about the afterschool programs in the afternoons, I appreciate the willingness to send the buses when they are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3908.969s">[Graham]</a>: I think that is a huge help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3911.97s">[Graham]</a>: And the folks whose kids are sitting and waiting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3916.391s">[Graham]</a>: for a really long time are really appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3918.552s">[Graham]</a>: They obviously want that to already have happened and be done yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3923.514s">[Graham]</a>: But I was talking to some parents recently, and they were talking about how their kid spends an hour on the bus from the Roberts to the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3932.459s">[Graham]</a>: And you all made some sort of route adjustment recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3935.52s">[Graham]</a>: And the parent sought me out to tell me that the change was dramatic for their kids getting off at their after-school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3943.644s">[Graham]</a>: And it was the difference but it was like a 40 minute 45 minute difference so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3950.091s">[Graham]</a>: And I am, I am interested in where else our roots can be optimized like that so that kids are not sitting on the bus because the truth is they're sitting in the elementary schools for some amount of time before they even get on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3964.426s">[Graham]</a>: for kids to not be getting to an after school program till like after 4pm 430.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3970.932s">[Graham]</a>: It's a very, very long time to wait and parents are paying for those services that they're not getting so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3977.153s">[Graham]</a>: If there are other route optimizations that can happen, I assume you use some sort of geo software that helps map the routes, but we would certainly be interested in anything you can do to support route optimization to get kids to their destination just a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4103.362s">[Graham]</a>: And then my last question, we have had multiple incidents where students have been let off the bus in the wrong place this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4112.246s">[Graham]</a>: And I fielded a call from a parent who was pretty distraught about that on a recent Friday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4120.689s">[Graham]</a>: And so I'm just curious from your standpoint, like, is there something we're doing in Medford that is exacerbating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4127.412s">[Graham]</a>: This situation where five year olds get off the bus and cross the square by themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4131.935s">[Graham]</a>: Is there something we could be doing differently to assist your drivers like what how do we make sure five year olds are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4138.513s">[Graham]</a>: traversing the square by themselves because they got off at the wrong stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4216.864s">[Graham]</a>: And so what can we do in Medford to make this easier on your drivers because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4224.918s">[Graham]</a>: I feel for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4227.499s">[Graham]</a>: I thought 63 was the number, so I'm a little blown away that it's 77.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4231.581s">[Graham]</a>: But obviously, it's a really hard job for them to keep control of the bus, to keep all the things from going right on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4240.284s">[Graham]</a>: And I'm just curious from your standpoint, what should we be doing that would help the situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4269.564s">[Graham]</a>: Does Cambridge pay for those monitors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4309.943s">[Graham]</a>: They're all going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4311.024s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4380.64s">[Graham]</a>: appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4382.401s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4383.442s">[Graham]</a>: So I think my request to the superintendent is that the principals be asked to make sure that kids are all tagged, that there is some sort of protocol for what happens when a new student gets on the bus so that we're in communication with the bus driver as as that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4401.479s">[Graham]</a>: feel like I've seen that happen before when I've been in sort of bus area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4407.321s">[Graham]</a>: But just to make sure that it is happening with some consistency, I think would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4413.003s">[Graham]</a>: And to try to lighten the load from a bus driver perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4418.765s">[Graham]</a>: And then your point about bus monitors, we've been asked that question many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4423.986s">[Graham]</a>: Obviously, it's a very expensive endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4427.117s">[Graham]</a>: and perhaps there's some relief coming on that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4430.999s">[Graham]</a>: So stay tuned for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4434.221s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you very much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=222.433s">[Graham]</a>: Can you all hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=224.654s">[Graham]</a>: Hi everyone, my name is Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=226.315s">[Graham]</a>: I think I know many or most of you from five years as a school committee member, most recently I've been vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=234.137s">[Graham]</a>: I'm also the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee for the Princeton household, commonly referred to as FSEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=242.521s">[Graham]</a>: FSEA is a statewide authority that helps communities like ours build new high schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=249.003s">[Graham]</a>: So we're not here to talk about anything for high school, but I do want to mention that that is another hat that I wear, so if you have questions about that, I'm happy to answer them after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=258.529s">[Graham]</a>: I'm excited that we're here because I'm excited that we all get to participate in this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=265.453s">[Graham]</a>: So this is the first time in Medgar we've ever let everybody have a choice and a voice in how our students forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=273.478s">[Graham]</a>: And we have some really big questions on the ballot this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=276.74s">[Graham]</a>: In my opinion, we should have done this sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=279.501s">[Graham]</a>: We can debate the merits of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=281.582s">[Graham]</a>: Again, at another time, maybe over coffee or a cocktail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=285.863s">[Graham]</a>: But here we are and we have some choices to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=288.764s">[Graham]</a>: If you're following the school budget over the course of the last year, you know that we faced some very difficult decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=297.107s">[Graham]</a>: That's a nice way to say we laid off human beings who work in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=302.109s">[Graham]</a>: So trust me when I tell you nobody wants to do that, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=308.951s">[Graham]</a>: There's really a disagreement that we need more and not fewer mental health supporters in our schools, that our teachers do without, that our buildings are in disrepair, and that we have no current cut forward to fund our technology replacement program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=325.656s">[Graham]</a>: So, those are real facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=328.437s">[Graham]</a>: They were very present when we negotiated the budget last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=333.32s">[Graham]</a>: The initial budget was much worse than where it landed, and we only landed in a slightly less bad place because we used one-time funds, also known as free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=346.005s">[Graham]</a>: to temporarily fill the gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=349.067s">[Graham]</a>: That's not a funding strategy for operating costs on a going forward basis or really for any sustainable content at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=355.949s">[Graham]</a>: I know that, I'm a finance major, I have a degree from Babson College, I run a business, I absolutely understand what it takes to make good decisions about these kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=366.614s">[Graham]</a>: And sometimes you have to do the things in the short term that give you the bridge to the long term and that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=371.796s">[Graham]</a>: So here we are, we're at sort of the other side of that bridge, and we're ready to make a plan for the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=378.641s">[Graham]</a>: I am hopeful that the energy in this community is going to say yes, we want to invest in Medford, we want to invest in kids, we want to invest in our fire department, we want to invest in our roads, and we will have a completely different conversation next time than really we've had for the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=394.331s">[Graham]</a>: budget cycles that I've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=395.992s">[Graham]</a>: It's always just been some version of bad because there simply is not enough money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=401.496s">[Graham]</a>: And I am ready to have a different conversation where we can talk about doing more for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=406.7s">[Graham]</a>: So I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=407.94s">[Graham]</a>: I'm going to pass it to Naomi Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=410.222s">[Graham]</a>: And we are excited to be here with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=412.323s">[Graham]</a>: We're happy to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=414.965s">[Graham]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1568.602s">[Graham]</a>: The only other thing I'll say about free cash from my perspective, that money is the bucket of money that we can use to do capital projects at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1579.834s">[Graham]</a>: So if there's nothing left at the end of the year, there are no opportunities for capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1586.04s">[Graham]</a>: The school budget is not resourced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1588.863s">[Graham]</a>: to do big capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1591.005s">[Graham]</a>: We rely on the city to be able to grant those one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1594.847s">[Graham]</a>: That's a very typical process in communities across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1599.69s">[Graham]</a>: Cities usually do sort of pick up the cost of those school-based projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1606.745s">[Graham]</a>: The school committee has re-launched a different and more rigorous capital planning process this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1615.371s">[Graham]</a>: We held our first meeting last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1617.233s">[Graham]</a>: Part of the reason we did that is I see some folks in the room who were part of building these new schools, and since then we really haven't done the right thing to maintain them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.441s">[Graham]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1627.961s">[Graham]</a>: Money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1630.043s">[Graham]</a>: It costs money to do maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1631.964s">[Graham]</a>: So there's a couple of ways we have to fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1634.866s">[Graham]</a>: One is, we have to start doing that maintenance, which means the operating budget of the schools has to increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1640.37s">[Graham]</a>: That's not free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1641.631s">[Graham]</a>: But the other is, we have realities like a broken water heater at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1646.734s">[Graham]</a>: They have to prepare food for children at the Brooks, and they need to be able to sanitize their equipment, and they don't have a hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1654.219s">[Graham]</a>: So they are, our staff are amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1656.801s">[Graham]</a>: They do everything that they can to work on all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1659.683s">[Graham]</a>: But the fact of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1661.994s">[Graham]</a>: All of the ways we could have done maintenance to this point and didn't, that leads us to capital needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1668.797s">[Graham]</a>: And so we have to get out of this cycle of waiting until something, there's a hole in the roof, a roof falls in, a hot water heater is broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1677.782s">[Graham]</a>: We should be able to do a better job with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1680.894s">[Graham]</a>: And we can say that we should have done a better job for the last however long the schools have been built, 20 years, 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1687.762s">[Graham]</a>: I agree with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1689.003s">[Graham]</a>: But here we are, and we have choices to make about how we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1693.228s">[Graham]</a>: And for me, I want to move forward in a productive way that addresses the backlog and sets us up on a path to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1700.576s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2294.41s">[Graham]</a>: Jen, would you like to start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2298.034s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2300.436s">[Graham]</a>: We put out an explainer, there's some copies of it in the back, it's, we call it a one-pager because it's intended to be printed from the back, but maybe it's a two-pager to some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2311.263s">[Graham]</a>: That document was our, my attempt with Member Reinfeldt, who I think is here somewhere, I think she's in the back, to be responsive to people saying, well, what is this for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2324.651s">[Graham]</a>: And the sneaky part is that when you're talking about the school budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2328.914s">[Graham]</a>: 80-85% of the school budget is subject to collective bargaining agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2333.422s">[Graham]</a>: So that means 80-85% of our costs are about personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2339.231s">[Graham]</a>: It's not uncommon, we're not unusual in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2342.737s">[Graham]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, we can't decide how much we're going to pay anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2349.658s">[Graham]</a>: That happens at a bargaining table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2351.819s">[Graham]</a>: And in order to put information out, we would have to be doing that in collaboration with people at the bargaining table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2359.2s">[Graham]</a>: Having those kinds of conversations when there is actually no money to spend is exceedingly difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2367.648s">[Graham]</a>: So what we did instead was try to give you an understanding based on numbers we could share, like how much those salaries cost in this past year that we used one-time funds to fund, how many positions we saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2381.734s">[Graham]</a>: So we really tried in question seven on that explainer to tell you a little bit about what we're preserving when that question is successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2391.258s">[Graham]</a>: For question eight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2392.97s">[Graham]</a>: What we tried to do, this one gets a little bit harder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2397.793s">[Graham]</a>: Because what we start to talk about is what could we do in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2402.055s">[Graham]</a>: And again, we're back at the bargaining table to talk about things like living wages for our paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2409.238s">[Graham]</a>: We've done a lot of work to improve the pay scales for our paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2414.861s">[Graham]</a>: They used to barely make a minimum wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2417.502s">[Graham]</a>: Now they make more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2420.304s">[Graham]</a>: But they come to the table and tell us that they deserve more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2425.393s">[Graham]</a>: We agree, but there is no more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2427.435s">[Graham]</a>: So, what we tried to do in that explainer, take a look, have the answer questions afterwards, is give you some details about what we might do with the knowledge that it will all be spent on schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2439.823s">[Graham]</a>: The school committee, through its statutory process around budgets, will hold hearings and pass a budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2447.969s">[Graham]</a>: So, we're here to pass a budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2450.331s">[Graham]</a>: That's what we're going to do when this is successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2454.392s">[Graham]</a>: Or we will cut the budget in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2456.294s">[Graham]</a>: That's the alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2457.174s">[Graham]</a>: So what seven does is help us not keep cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2461.517s">[Graham]</a>: What eight does is allow us to have a different conversation about the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2465.619s">[Graham]</a>: That is not about doing less and less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2621.615s">[Graham]</a>: So I actually went digging and Bedford has a history of flatlining budgets for the schools or giving an increase that's not enough to cover contractual increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.065s">[Graham]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2635.766s">[Graham]</a>: That has happened in Bedford for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2638.908s">[Graham]</a>: The only time I could find an instance where we actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2643.51s">[Graham]</a>: reduced the school budget was like back in the 80s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2646.576s">[Graham]</a>: So we really don't have a history of cutting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2650.482s">[Graham]</a>: We have some history, unfortunately, of flatlining the budget, and we have some history of underfunding the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2656.923s">[Graham]</a>: So there's really no history of us cutting the budget on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2661.227s">[Graham]</a>: Other departments, I think for sure, have had different experiences with that, but when we talk about could we cut the budget, if we did, we would be handing out pay slips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2672.256s">[Graham]</a>: We would be talking about the positions that we're eliminating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2676.98s">[Graham]</a>: And that's not what anybody wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2679.922s">[Graham]</a>: It's not my priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2682.364s">[Graham]</a>: There needs to be more help for our students, not less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2686.367s">[Graham]</a>: So that fear, I understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2689.768s">[Graham]</a>: When you don't get to personally hand out the dollars, I understand that there's always a feeling that someone might not do it the way that you do, but that's why we have a committee of seven people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2700.532s">[Graham]</a>: The mayor doesn't get to decide this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2702.572s">[Graham]</a>: I don't get to decide this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2704.433s">[Graham]</a>: It requires the majority vote of the school committee to spend every single penny that is spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3063.578s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3065.26s">[Graham]</a>: So to the questions that are in the community about the finance task force, that's exactly what we did each time we met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3073.089s">[Graham]</a>: We had one question to answer, which was, what is our go forward plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3078.396s">[Graham]</a>: We talked in a lot of detail about what that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3082.159s">[Graham]</a>: We talked a lot about plans for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3084.361s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about the high school coming online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3086.403s">[Graham]</a>: We talked about is this the start of a series of overrides or is it the end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3091.968s">[Graham]</a>: You know, is it a one-time shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3093.649s">[Graham]</a>: And we sort of landed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3095.031s">[Graham]</a>: I guess I would say somewhere in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3096.532s">[Graham]</a>: So we do not want to be putting questions before you like some communities do every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3103.535s">[Graham]</a>: We're new at this in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3104.876s">[Graham]</a>: We have no community muscle around how to do it, how to have productive conversations that are respectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3110.798s">[Graham]</a>: We're all learning through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3112.439s">[Graham]</a>: So you're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3113.74s">[Graham]</a>: You're not all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3114.84s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3117.021s">[Graham]</a>: And what we landed on was a number that was big enough to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3121.824s">[Graham]</a>: smaller than what the real need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3124.105s">[Graham]</a>: And what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3125.265s">[Graham]</a>: That means we have, again, created a bridge to a place where development can help start to carry some more of the load than it historically has been able to do in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3137.767s">[Graham]</a>: The final comment was about the school committee raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3140.448s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to correct the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3142.148s">[Graham]</a>: We did not receive a 143% raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3146.649s">[Graham]</a>: we received a $5,000 raise for the first time for the position in 24 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3153.151s">[Graham]</a>: I could tell you and we can talk afterwards about all the work that the school committee does, it is equivalent to the work of the council and I continue to believe that we should be paid the same as the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3165.613s">[Graham]</a>: But 5,000 is not 143% of $12,000, so that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3168.594s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3356.794s">[Graham]</a>: On the school side, I would point you to the detailed graphic that actually does talk about the positions we saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3364.117s">[Graham]</a>: Those would be the first positions that would be cut in another sort of down budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3371.601s">[Graham]</a>: So if these are not successful, those positions are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3376.823s">[Graham]</a>: July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3377.683s">[Graham]</a>: So we will say goodbye to humans who work in our school district again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3380.584s">[Graham]</a>: I don't want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3382.345s">[Graham]</a>: I don't want us to keep all of those folks because they're really important to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3386.966s">[Graham]</a>: And more importantly, I want to have the ability to address some of the structural issues that we have in our schools around totally incompatible high school schedules, the minimum number of hours that the state allows us, not enough transportation, all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3404.324s">[Graham]</a>: can't even meet conversations if question 8 does not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3408.229s">[Graham]</a>: If they pass, we can have a conversation and we will have to decide what our priorities are because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3414.841s">[Graham]</a>: There's $4 million is not the full enchilada in terms of fully funding everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3419.923s">[Graham]</a>: We're still very far away from a free public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3423.945s">[Graham]</a>: We can debate the merits of free public school systems and things like free lunch at another time, but this amount of money does not put us even in the legal territory of giving away a free education, which probably I think we should do, but that's not what this does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3440.951s">[Graham]</a>: This helps us move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3797.866s">[Graham]</a>: January 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3798.626s">[Graham]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3800.327s">[Graham]</a>: Except question six, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3802.509s">[Graham]</a>: The debt exclusion is not until there's an actual bond to be issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4631.917s">[Graham]</a>: Our overall school enrollment hasn't changed that much in the last handful of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4637.438s">[Graham]</a>: What we are experiencing is record numbers of kindergartners coming into our schools every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4645.3s">[Graham]</a>: So if you use what they call a survival analysis that says how does that kindergartner become a first grader and a second grader and a third grader, the numbers climb over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4657.967s">[Graham]</a>: But what we do know is that two of our school buildings are absolutely busting at the seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4664.734s">[Graham]</a>: The Roberts and the Brooks are busting at the seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4667.677s">[Graham]</a>: There's not any more space in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4670.78s">[Graham]</a>: So if we have another record kindergarten here next year, we're going to have an issue in those two buildings in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4677.467s">[Graham]</a>: That's not the case in all four of our elementary school buildings and so there's some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4681.84s">[Graham]</a>: potentially expensive redistricting that we may have to do pretty urgently to deal with the realities of how the population is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4692.525s">[Graham]</a>: We also, looking forward, are looking at our population in our school system changing as we invest in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4702.989s">[Graham]</a>: We expect more parents to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4709.284s">[Graham]</a>: increase the number of students, both at the middle school and the high school is our prediction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4800.43s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, I'll take a shot at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4801.831s">[Graham]</a>: How did we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4804.112s">[Graham]</a>: We have been constrained by Prop 2.5 since 1980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4806.933s">[Graham]</a>: That's how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4808.073s">[Graham]</a>: Inflation is more than 2.5% every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4811.895s">[Graham]</a>: You can see, actually we should pass this chart around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4814.936s">[Graham]</a>: You can see that Medford's new growth has been marginal since that same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4819.939s">[Graham]</a>: So the two levers we have are taxation and new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4823.78s">[Graham]</a>: And we haven't done any more taxation than 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4828.092s">[Graham]</a>: and our new growth has been very minor in nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4833.273s">[Graham]</a>: Meanwhile, all of our costs are exploding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4835.393s">[Graham]</a>: Our healthcare, our pensions, all of those things go up in double digits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4840.214s">[Graham]</a>: So we're sort of at a squeeze point and we have decisions that we have to make as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4845.335s">[Graham]</a>: Why we didn't do it sooner, it takes a tremendous amount of will for elected officials to allow the city to vote in a representative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4858.413s">[Graham]</a>: When you're an elected official, you have what many people think is tons of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4862.658s">[Graham]</a>: I don't personally feel that way, but lots of people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4866.242s">[Graham]</a>: And you have a lot of decisions to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4868.484s">[Graham]</a>: And so there's two ways you can make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4870.286s">[Graham]</a>: One is you can make decisions, and the other is you can ask the community to help you make the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4875.332s">[Graham]</a>: So this is us saying to you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4877.472s">[Graham]</a>: we're asking you to help us make this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4880.253s">[Graham]</a>: So there is no more direct democracy than a ballot question in a presidential election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4886.154s">[Graham]</a>: We are expecting wonderful turnout, there's a lot of energy, and we're super excited to see what this community really thinks of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=0.389s">[Graham]</a>: in the interest of time, get going through this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=6.815s">[Graham]</a>: So we do have a quorum, so I think we can start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=10.078s">[Graham]</a>: I will read the agenda and then we can call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=16.043s">[Graham]</a>: Please be advised that on October 28th at 5 p.m., there will be a special meeting of the Medford School Committee to be held remotely via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=23.41s">[Graham]</a>: This meeting is being recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=25.746s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast Channel 9, 8 or 22 and Verizon Channel 43, 45 or 47.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=39.015s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting will be recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=40.596s">[Graham]</a>: Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in by using the following information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=45.859s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting ID is 917-5576-1532.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=53.522s">[Graham]</a>: Questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=61.85s">[Graham]</a>: And those too many questions must also include the following your first and last name, your Medford street address, and your question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=69.252s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, member Rousseau, if you could call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=92.689s">[Graham]</a>: So for president and three absent, um, if we can all please stand to salute the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=117.184s">[Graham]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=119.629s">[Graham]</a>: Our agenda today is long and short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=124.05s">[Graham]</a>: We have one item on the agenda, that's the short part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=127.571s">[Graham]</a>: The long part is that it is the first reading of Policy ACGB Title IX Sexual Discrimination Grievance Procedure Resolution 2024-38 offered by Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=143.656s">[Graham]</a>: Member Rousseau, before we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=145.859s">[Graham]</a>: Dive into reading this 18 page policy, did you want to give us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=150.161s">[Graham]</a>: Um, uh, some headlines about what this policy is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=428.815s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to waive the reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=437.561s">[Graham]</a>: So a motion to waive the reading by Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=439.743s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=441.584s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded by Member Brandley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=444.706s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=451.731s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=476.201s">[Graham]</a>: Um, so remember, so I think it probably makes sense to go through this like chunk by chunk and just ask for folks to let us know if they have questions or comments, um, about that as we go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=489.812s">[Graham]</a>: And then once we, um, go through that, we can sort of see where we land and decide, you know, if there's another motion to entertain, um, whether to pass this or, or, um, pass it on to another meeting or, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=505.256s">[Graham]</a>: take care of waving, reading both readings here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=509.711s">[Graham]</a>: So before we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=547.567s">[Graham]</a>: Remember so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=660.498s">[Graham]</a>: It'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=664.841s">[Graham]</a>: And then let's, we can start at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=669.127s">[Graham]</a>: There is a preamble that goes on for several pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=672.47s">[Graham]</a>: So up until page halfway down page five is a preamble that, um, in my reading describes like what the intention of the policy is and why it was, um, built in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=688.544s">[Graham]</a>: So I will, um, open the floor to any questions about the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=707.267s">[Graham]</a>: Hearing and seeing no questions on the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=710.75s">[Graham]</a>: The next section is definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=808.808s">[Graham]</a>: And this is, I guess my only thought is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=812.938s">[Graham]</a>: that we're not changing anything of substance, but we might be if we make this change, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=820.343s">[Graham]</a>: If we're not intending for it to be substantive, but it would be unbeknownst to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=827.188s">[Graham]</a>: So I would advocate that we leave it alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=830.511s">[Graham]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=832.372s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=842.8s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so about halfway down page five, we start with definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=850.184s">[Graham]</a>: And it looks like they go to page eight, halfway down page eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=857.627s">[Graham]</a>: Yes, I am looking at the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=858.887s">[Graham]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=859.848s">[Graham]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=887.041s">[Graham]</a>: Questions about the definitions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=895.648s">[Graham]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=896.629s">[Graham]</a>: The next section is about reporting sexual discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=902.435s">[Graham]</a>: and filing a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=905.096s">[Graham]</a>: So that goes on for several pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1079.234s">[Graham]</a>: Not in the policy that I can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1081.195s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1160.635s">[Graham]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1227.156s">[Graham]</a>: It also doesn't want to read 18 page prophecies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1732.686s">[Graham]</a>: Can you give us an example?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1733.966s">[Graham]</a>: Like I'm not tracking like a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1736.927s">[Graham]</a>: If a group does something, it's because individuals in the group did something, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1813.473s">[Graham]</a>: I mean, I think in the end, like, the district can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1821.076s">[Graham]</a>: Like, they can't broadly meet out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1824.538s">[Graham]</a>: Consequences, like, they have to do that specifically and individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1828.719s">[Graham]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1829.34s">[Graham]</a>: So I could see why a parents would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1921.232s">[Graham]</a>: So, Member Reinfeldt, as it relates to a Title IX investigation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3045.145s">[Graham]</a>: So is your suggestion that there be more than one person listed as an appeals facilitator?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3407.974s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3412.947s">[Graham]</a>: questions or changes suggested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3574.543s">[Graham]</a>: There are a motion to approve the first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3585.598s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve the first reading by Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3588.218s">[Graham]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3591.179s">[Graham]</a>: Seconded by Member Branley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3594.039s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3599.88s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3601.921s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3621.519s">[Graham]</a>: So five in the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3628.622s">[Graham]</a>: And I think the question that you have is, does this go, are we waiving a second reading or is this going to another meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3639.048s">[Graham]</a>: Is that your question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3639.948s">[Graham]</a>: That is my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3681.824s">[Graham]</a>: Okay, so the second reading will be on our next school committee agenda, which is a week from today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3694.03s">[Graham]</a>: Are there any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3699.613s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3701.635s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to adjourn by member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3703.576s">[Graham]</a>: I'm on a second roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3705.917s">[Graham]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3707.538s">[Graham]</a>: Member Bramley, roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3725.088s">[Graham]</a>: I've been the affirmative to absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3727.135s">[Graham]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=19.101s">[Graham]</a>: Dr cushing, I had some trouble getting in via the link that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=26.852s">[Graham]</a>: On the agenda on the website, so just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=32.019s">[Graham]</a>: I was unsuccessful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=32.9s">[Graham]</a>: Somebody sent me a separate link and I got here, but so I don't know if there was just something strange happening on my end, but I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=40.259s">[Graham]</a>: Oh, OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=41.279s">[Graham]</a>: I just want to make sure if other people are trying to get in that they don't sort of get stuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=46.041s">[Graham]</a>: So if you all hear of anybody else having a problem, let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=189.125s">[Graham]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=206.397s">[Graham]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=207.118s">[Graham]</a>: Item number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=209.16s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, we have the good of the order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=211.842s">[Graham]</a>: Any comments from the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=228.998s">[Graham]</a>: Thank you to all the committee members for taking time out of their day to days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=234.003s">[Graham]</a>: We're all to attend later this week in hiatus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=238.622s">[Graham]</a>: And, um, we will move on to the consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=241.684s">[Graham]</a>: So item number four is the consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=244.265s">[Graham]</a>: We have approval of bills and payrolls approval, capital purchases, approval of grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=248.627s">[Graham]</a>: Um, there is one grant being requested to be approved by the Medford educational foundation for $1,000 for model UN approval of field trips and approval of meeting minutes, our regular meeting on October 21st and our special meeting on October 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=263.834s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=280.679s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to sever the minutes for October 28th by member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=285.2s">[Graham]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=311.254s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=311.494s">[Graham]</a>: There's seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=314.916s">[Graham]</a>: The motion is severed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=316.597s">[Graham]</a>: And then we have a motion by Member Rousseau to approve the remainder of the consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=327.559s">[Graham]</a>: and seconded by member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=331.021s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=349.653s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=352.735s">[Graham]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=354.736s">[Graham]</a>: The consent agenda is approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=357.612s">[Graham]</a>: Um, the special meeting on October 28th member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=361.356s">[Graham]</a>: So, did you have a question or comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=390.291s">[Graham]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=391.812s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve as amended by member Rousseau, seconded by member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=395.374s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=418.524s">[Graham]</a>: Um, item number five report of subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=420.487s">[Graham]</a>: We have none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=421.067s">[Graham]</a>: Uh, and onto item number six, which is the report of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=426.254s">[Graham]</a>: So, um, number one, the superintendent updates and comments, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1114.284s">[Graham]</a>: Item number two is a recommendation to approve a vehicle donation, approximate value of $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1120.288s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1125.151s">[Graham]</a>: Dr. Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1141.744s">[Graham]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1144.645s">[Graham]</a>: Motion to approve by Mayor Longo Kern seconded by Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1151.708s">[Graham]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5766.038s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5768.379s">[Graham]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5827.904s">[Graham]</a>: Mayor, can I just add some context?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5833.467s">[Graham]</a>: A parent reached out to me about this somewhat recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5838.891s">[Graham]</a>: And I thought there might even be some students on who wanted to speak this evening, but I'm not seeing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5848.577s">[Graham]</a>: But my goal here is to say that the situation with the bathrooms at Medford High<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5855.801s">[Graham]</a>: Is untenable, like, we have students who don't go to the bathroom all day long who don't drink anything during the school day and it's because they have to, like, wander the halls to find an open bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5867.865s">[Graham]</a>: My own daughter says the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5869.485s">[Graham]</a>: And I get that there is, like, a need for us to have some balance between.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5879.924s">[Graham]</a>: everything open all the time and some way to properly supervise these spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5886.467s">[Graham]</a>: But what we're doing right now is not it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5890.669s">[Graham]</a>: We haven't arrived at a balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5893.391s">[Graham]</a>: We have arrived at students having to wander the halls to figure out where the bathroom is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5898.273s">[Graham]</a>: And every time we talk about this, I really hope it's the last time we ever talk about it, because I don't want to talk about the bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5907.838s">[Graham]</a>: It just like we never seem to actually make any progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5910.761s">[Graham]</a>: So I am asking the administration to bring forward a proposal of like, tell us what you need in order to improve this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5922.193s">[Graham]</a>: And what will an improved situation look like under some new plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5927.058s">[Graham]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5928.288s">[Graham]</a>: I am asking the administration to come back with a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5934.732s">[Graham]</a>: But I would hope that they will start with saying, what are the problems as all of our constituents in this picture see the problems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5945.899s">[Graham]</a>: And how are we going to fix all of those problems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5951.656s">[Graham]</a>: There are real constraints from a staffing perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5954.819s">[Graham]</a>: Do we need more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5956.0s">[Graham]</a>: If we need more staff, what kind of staff do we need and how much will that cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5960.224s">[Graham]</a>: Now is the time for us to be having these conversations because a budget season is coming quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5966.829s">[Graham]</a>: But we may also have an infusion of funding to be talking about very, very shortly here, which I'm hopeful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5977.446s">[Graham]</a>: But I want to hear from the administration, what is the totality of the problems that sort of get in the way of everybody feeling bad about the bathroom situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5989.83s">[Graham]</a>: And what could make it better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5992.711s">[Graham]</a>: What could we do to make the situation better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5997.513s">[Graham]</a>: And what would that take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5999.074s">[Graham]</a>: So I'm really asking for somebody to step back from where they are today and figure out, how do we move past this conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6011.163s">[Graham]</a>: Because every time we talk about it, we talk about it as if we have done something different that's going to move us past the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6018.969s">[Graham]</a>: And that's just simply not happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6023.112s">[Graham]</a>: My daughter was telling me just the other day, she's like, oh, yeah, there's no schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6026.855s">[Graham]</a>: Everyone says there's a schedule, but there's no schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6028.976s">[Graham]</a>: And so you just wander the halls until you find a bathroom that you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6032.279s">[Graham]</a>: And they're gross, and there are lots of kids inside vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6036.582s">[Graham]</a>: And so for all the supervision, we're still having all of those problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6039.604s">[Graham]</a>: Something has to change in this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6042.046s">[Graham]</a>: It's a real climate and culture issue, in my opinion, for the high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6047.85s">[Graham]</a>: They don't want to go to a school where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6051.994s">[Graham]</a>: don't want to use the bathrooms because they're gross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6054.596s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6055.517s">[Graham]</a>: It's all got to change somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6057.838s">[Graham]</a>: And I don't know what the changes are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6062.061s">[Graham]</a>: I don't know what those things might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6064.403s">[Graham]</a>: But I am asking for us to actually dig in and come up with something that is a solution rather than just sort of shrugging and continuing to do the same things we've always done that don't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6079.028s">[Graham]</a>: So that's the genesis of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6740.772s">[Graham]</a>: I guess some of these things that are frankly, I'm really happy that Francis has supported us because we've just simply not been staffed to be able to do some of these things ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6753.58s">[Graham]</a>: But we have made some investments in the HR team in particular, and I think we should be looking at what is the right thing for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6766.625s">[Graham]</a>: For the district for a district of our size to have 800 employees, having this capability is, I think, important for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6776.43s">[Graham]</a>: I think the lines get very blurry when things go over to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6781.573s">[Graham]</a>: So, for example, if.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6783.414s">[Graham]</a>: something comes to Francis's desk and then it requires some sort of appeal, does it go to the mayor or does it go to the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6790.676s">[Graham]</a>: Because the mayor doesn't have the authority over the schools that the superintendent does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6796.417s">[Graham]</a>: And I just think when I look at this list, there are certain pieces of this list that I frankly would expect the administration to be able to handle without needing Francis's support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6807.58s">[Graham]</a>: And I think there's other stuff that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6810.781s">[Graham]</a>: The team probably needs training on to do well, but I don't think the answer is personally continuing to to sort of rely on whatever you know sort of slice of Francis's time she can provide so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6827.029s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not super in favor of this and it's not because I'm not grateful, but I think actually the thing I would want Francis to do is train our own staff so that we have this capability within our schools in a way that allows the people who spend the most time in the schools to be able to do this work that's relative and specific to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6848.391s">[Graham]</a>: I have some real reservations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6851.032s">[Graham]</a>: I also feel like we sort of are heading down a slippery slope of shared services, which was not the intention, at least for me, when we decided to accept that statute and share some resource on the facility side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6867.722s">[Graham]</a>: And you did mention some sort of stipend, but this doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6874.677s">[Graham]</a>: say what that is or who pays for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6876.901s">[Graham]</a>: So I have a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6878.904s">[Graham]</a>: I'm not particularly in favor of this as written, but I will defer to my colleagues who might have other thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7679.003s">[Graham]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7682.025s">[Graham]</a>: Still unclear what the stipend is that we're tacitly approving and who is paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7725.575s">[Graham]</a>: It's not what we're talking about here, but we did not approve to pay for that stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7730.377s">[Graham]</a>: So I just want to point that out as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7733.978s">[Graham]</a>: If we're going to do these things, I think we need to be really clear about who's paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7738.66s">[Graham]</a>: Like my understanding was that a stipend would be paid, but I was under the impression the city was going to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7744.322s">[Graham]</a>: And so now that's coming to our budget, which means this committee should be approving it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7748.743s">[Graham]</a>: and deciding on what's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7750.324s">[Graham]</a>: So I do think we have to get a little bit more precise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7755.349s">[Graham]</a>: When I look at this list, I understand that these are all things that have happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7759.612s">[Graham]</a>: But I just have some real questions about why our central administration can't handle some of these things without Francis's support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7767.679s">[Graham]</a>: So I understand it's lovely and amazing to have somebody who you can call to provide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7773.544s">[Graham]</a>: input and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7774.545s">[Graham]</a>: I have colleagues like that all that I rely on in that same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7779.827s">[Graham]</a>: But that's to me different than saying this is part of Francis's set of responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7787.291s">[Graham]</a>: What's not on here is any transition that would actually put the schools in a position to be able to do some of these things for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7797.85s">[Graham]</a>: Particularly around accommodations, I don't know how many there are on an annual basis, but our HR team should be able to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7805.98s">[Graham]</a>: An HR department of 800 employees should be able to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7809.364s">[Graham]</a>: And I understand that that requires some specific training and we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7813.99s">[Graham]</a>: So I, I am, I'm fine with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7816.833s">[Graham]</a>: some of this stuff happening temporarily, but that's not what this says, which is why I am in favor of sending it to subcommittee so that we can ask our HR people and Francis to get in a room and talk about what is best for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7833.878s">[Graham]</a>: I would really prefer to hear from them about it than this group of people who's not involved in that work to decide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7843.195s">[Graham]</a>: Um, I just, I have some, so I still, I know what I now know what we're paying already for his support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7850.941s">[Graham]</a>: Um, but I still don't think I know what the proposed stipend is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7854.024s">[Graham]</a>: And if we are making a budget expenditure, we need to know what that is.<br><br>
