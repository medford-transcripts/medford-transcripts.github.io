 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2346.256s">So</a> I just have a frank question for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2350.019s">Do</a> you think that staying open until two, you would be able to be pretty successful if you were not having the loud music on the, you know, like if an event ended, you know, if like a music event or something ended at one, but then you stayed open until two o'clock, like, can it be quieter? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2369.396s">I</a> know that we can't like write that into the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2371.898s">the</a> rules here we kind of binary but do you think that you'd be more successful if you know and would you basically sort of commit to making every effort to keep the noise down after one o'clock yes absolutely absolutely yeah yeah like no one's outside everything's off outside the lights are off so everyone's inside that would make me feel more comfortable um if like you're aware that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2399.308s">That</a> is an issue and making your best at like people can have as good a time as they want to indoors without the you know music layering and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2408.304s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2584.916s">Thanks,</a> just a little follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2586.717s">I'm</a> hoping and kind of assuming that we're going to have a 30, 60, 90 day follow up to this change so we can check in with residents and make sure that it's working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2598.42s">And</a> then also wanted to say that you guys are going to have some stiff competition with Donuts with a Difference, which makes amazing donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2605.542s">So</a> we'll see how, as a donut person, I'm excited to do a comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2610.224s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2610.824s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3600.331s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3603.253s">I</a> hope that you hear that I certainly and many members of the councilors really want you to be successful and want to approve these hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3610.299s">I</a> think for me personally, I want to see improvements on the neighbor's experience before increasing the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3620.086s">I</a> think that's just how I feel personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3622.368s">So</a> I don't think I'm gonna vote in favor of these hours right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3628.113s">I</a> am not a sound engineer, but I really took to the comments saying that, you know, maybe hiring somebody for some small consulting to really dig deep into how you can ameliorate those issues and working with the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3643.725s">And</a> I would love to see you come back if this does not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3647.909s">And</a> because I want you to be successful and
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5600.435s">I'm</a> just curious, how many stump removals do we normally do, like within our budget per year?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5617.781s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5618.041s">No,</a> I understood that you said it was being 40 and 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5619.542s">But</a> like, yeah, when we normally not asking for capital funds, like within our normal budget, like how many do we normally?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5637.849s">Okay,</a> but my follow up question is about when these stumps are removed, and these are, I assume sidewalk trees?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5646.181s">Predominantly?</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5647.503s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5648.244s">Will</a> the tree pits be left open?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5668.041s">Great,</a> but those tree pits are not gonna be filled over with cement as part of this?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5685.924s">And</a> if I may ask, these places where there were trees, where there is now a planned non-replacement of the tree, that stuff is all gonna be in the final, the big, I'm missing the term, the tree, not the inventory, but the tree master plan that we're developing?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5737.112s">Great,</a> tiny follow up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5738.813s">Do</a> you know if the tree report and the master plan will include information about which tree pits are currently too small for us to replace those trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5749.362s">Because</a> it sounds like, am I correct that that's the size of the tree pit is what, like, if it's too small, that's probably why the tree is dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5755.307s">And</a> then let's not keep that tree pit.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5758.369s">There</a> will be information in that sort of master plan about which of our tree pits are too small?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5798.24s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7136.496s">So</a> I'm just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7137.437s">I</a> note that we're replacing the fire truck from 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7139.758s">We're</a> replacing the police cars from 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7143.241s">And</a> one from 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7145.662s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7147.303s">I</a> know I didn't own a car for 20 years, and then I bought a 20-year-old car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7151.006s">That</a> was six years ago, and my car this summer, finally, 26-year-old car, finally died. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7155.669s">So</a> I bought a 15-year-old car. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7158.871s">But</a> I'm curious about, like, is this a thing that we will see, like, that the trucks are going to be, you know, 25 years before we replace them, but the cars are going to be seven years, the police cars are going to be seven years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7172.819s">Like,</a> just looking at that sort of differential between, like, the age of the vehicles, clearly there are different kinds of vehicles.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7249.918s">So</a> I guess I'm just, I'm just looking ahead thinking, are we going to need like <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7256.523s">the</a> age of the fire trucks, are they all like way, and I know we've been through this before, but we're gonna need to be spending on fire trucks more because those are so much older.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7906.444s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7907.365s">I</a> would just love a super quick update on our, you know, 300 million year old sewer and water lines, if you can give in a minute or less.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7968.645s">Just</a> a little bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7972.631s">Like,</a> where are we on our ability to be able to make all these repairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=7977.052s">Like,</a> we're still in the planning phase, right, of how we're going to make all these repairs?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8342.495s">I</a> just had a question about the capital improvement plan update. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8345.096s">Do</a> we know?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8348.796s">There's</a> no one here to talk about it, but still, do we know if that's like paying a consultant? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=8352.577s">Is</a> that like, what is, we don't know what that's for?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10182.898s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10183.118s">It's</a> a tiny discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10184.099s">I</a> wanted to make sure, um, in this third, whereas you say strongly incentivizing 20 unit properties, but not 21, I assume you mean 24 unit and not 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10194.985s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c/2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c.html">Medford City Council Candidate Forum 2025</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2711.815s">I</a> am very sorry to hear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2716.097s">I</a> want my city to be a pro-union city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2718.598s">I</a> think the janitorial staff should be union members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2723.9s">So</a> I will certainly do what I can to look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2729.786s">clearly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2731.447s">City</a> is not the purview of the City Council exactly, but I really appreciate you coming here and bringing your stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2739.553s">And</a> it definitely is something that we can have an impact on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=2742.695s">So</a> let's see what we can do.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8440.923s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8443.303s">I</a> know that I am in favor of the good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8447.524s">I</a> know there has been some investigation sort of behind the scenes about asking the assessor about whether it would in fact be limited to two to four unit properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8461.887s">And</a> I think that it's just, it would be best for us to have this discussion in a committee where we can all hear the assessor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8470.169s">It</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8470.91s">We</a> have a new solicitor or bigger to have the solicitor, you know, provide legal opinion because really it is a legal opinion on what this state law, whether the state law will actually do what it is written that it will do, or if it will not be upheld to that writing that passed in the past session. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8488.947s">And</a> I really want to get to the bottom of whether we can pass this here in Medford because I would like to, and I just want to understand and have the full council be able to understand if there are reasons why we're not able to get this thing passed.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8626.143s">This</a> is a good letter of tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=8628.305s">Asking</a> the city for their opinion and then the assessor for the motion.<h2><a href="../2025-07-16_1dIxixg8FHg/2025-07-16_1dIxixg8FHg.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 07-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1271.262s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1272.083s">Um,</a> I just want to catch up my fellow Councilors as well as members of the public that at our last meeting, we sent this particular ordinance to have discussions with staff specifically, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1285.595s">With</a> the DPW commissioner as well as our <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1295.564s">the</a> DPW commissioner had already sent me some edits to it and some concerns, things to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1303.208s">So</a> we updated the wording with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1307.35s">And</a> then I also met with Trees Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1310.592s">Trees</a> Medford has been instrumental in creating this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1314.874s">And</a> they were also very happy with the changes that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1317.795s">So</a> today I'm hoping that this ordinance, which has been <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1323.458s">in</a> committee a number of times can get sent to the City Council, but obviously we'll go through it one change at a time and see how the committee feels.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1336.423s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1339.747s">The</a> purpose of the ordinance, I'll just read it right out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1342.669s">The</a> Medford Tree Committee will promote a diverse, healthy and sustainable urban forest that will provide for the health, general welfare and quality of life of Medford citizens and the beauty and quality of the city's environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1353.315s">And</a> really the purpose of this is just to have residents involved, to have a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1359.379s">We</a> have many commissions and committees and to have one that can specifically focus on trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1364.082s">So</a> the changes that were made were <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1369.345s">primarily</a> to the duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1373.127s">And</a> I can go over some of those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1375.169s">There</a> were a couple of items that we removed from the duties because Commissioner, DPW Commissioner McGivern mentioned that these are already duplicates of things that are being done by the DPW, their DPW jurisdiction and should not be given to a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1398.162s">So</a> we removed those. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1400.043s">We</a> also changed some of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1404.565s">So</a> for example, around the community forestry management plan, Commissioner McGivern again felt that this was a little bit more the jurisdiction of the DPW and the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1418.37s">So</a> rather than actively creating or working on that, <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1424.54s">We</a> change it to reviewing the community forestry management plan provided by the DPW forest division, reviewing the administration's progress and implementing the plan, as well as reporting any concerns to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1439.366s">So</a> just sort of being available to make sure that these plans are being followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1445.968s">and</a> to help if they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1448.069s">Similarly,</a> with the annual report of tree planting and tree removal and maintenance, so this already is a report that is created, so rather than, you know, handing that to the tree committee, it's simply reviewing, requesting the annual report, reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1467.588s">and</a> much of it otherwise has remained the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1470.389s">I</a> believe we did have a long discussion about the tree inventory and came to the conclusion that it would not actually be helpful for the tree committee to update the tree inventory because <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1488.293s">reasons.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1488.613s">I</a> could go into that long detail if people are interested, I'm happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1492.755s">But</a> basically, switched it again to reviewing the inventory, as well as the administration's sort of ability to maintain the inventory, just keeping a check that the inventory itself is being updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1511.702s">And</a> then the very last point, which is labeled as A, but I believe that should be <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1518.318s">I'm</a> looking at my copy, I'm not sure if I'm looking at the same copy, but the very last point of being available to assist the tree warden really rather than putting, sorry, to assist the tree warden in intended placement or replacement of trees, just switching the language a little bit so that they are available to help as needed rather than it being specifically in the hands of the tree committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1543.131s">So</a> as you can see, most of it was taking a few things that, <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1547.133s">that</a> had been officially like the tree committee will do this and saying no, actually, those things are already done by the DPW and saying that now instead, the ordinance says that the tree committee will be available to help or will review. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1561.479s">And</a> that's most of the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1562.76s">I'm</a> going to pause there and ask if there are any questions about the duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1568.262s">But</a> after that, I'd like to go back to the appointment section.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1600.707s">No,</a> it would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1601.448s">It</a> could not cover private trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1603.049s">It</a> is only the public trees.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1679.077s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1679.337s">And</a> just a quick reply, which is that letter F does specifically say promoting equity of tree planting across the city, including in neighborhoods identified as needing more trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1688.902s">So</a> I feel that that's adequately covered in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1692.624s">And</a> thank you for bringing that up.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1739.448s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1739.708s">So</a> I was actually just about to go to now review the appointments section. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1744.412s">So</a> that was just the duties section, and I'd love to go over the appointments section, because that is one of the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1750.356s">So</a> in the appointments section, the staff did not ask for changes, but they did make some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1757.622s">And</a> so if I can just go over those comments with you all, and folks can make any suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1766.578s">One</a> is that, I apologize, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1775.927s">I'm</a> not, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1780.211s">Do</a> we wanna, I mean, let's see, I'm not looking at the same copy that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1786.436s">I'm</a> looking at a copy that I have, like the track changes.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1798.555s">Let</a> me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1799.535s">I</a> mean, I need the copy that I've got some notes in, that's all, so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1813.89s">I</a> think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1815.151s">I</a> think that would be helpful for the public and everything.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1838.096s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1841.917s">So</a> the first comment, which was from Director Hunt was whether there was a process for removing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1850.018s">And</a> she mentioned that for sort of advisory and educating committee like this one, it's good to allow it to be fairly large, but then you may want to have a process for removing people for non-participation because otherwise you sometimes can't meet quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1867.802s">So</a> that's one element, and I think I have some language that we could pull from the HRC ordinance, the Human Rights Commission ordinance about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1874.993s">So</a> that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1879.047s">And</a> then the second one was specifically about the line that you were just mentioning, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1884.252s">It</a> says in letter A, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1893.121s">We</a> could leave that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1894.102s">Therese</a> Medford is also happy for that to become softer, either a suggestion or only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1899.547s">So</a> I think that's something for us to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1908.413s">In</a> letter B, there originally was more stringent language, so we've already softened letter B, which says at least one member of the committee, it now says, will demonstrate expertise in the field of urban forestry and or landscape design. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1921.961s">And</a> Medford residency is not required if this requisite expertise is demonstrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1927.164s">It</a> previously said that they had professional experience, and so I think this is softened language. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1937.948s">And</a> then my other comment, which I think I noticed very late today, is that we currently under letter C, the appointments are split among one year, two year, and three years for the first five people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1955.624s">but</a> it does not really adequately deal with if, for example, we appoint 10 people, like those other five people would then be appointed for terms of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1965.528s">And</a> then we would suddenly have like one person, two people, and then, you know, seven people all up at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1972.071s">So</a> maybe some language around that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=1977.593s">So</a> any comments on those specific questions that staff had?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2227.5s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2230.282s">So</a> I am very happy for them to be Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2235.047s">I</a> would lean maybe toward just the one member with demonstrated expertise, the residency being not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2244.615s">So</a> I'd be interested in what other Councilors think of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2247.838s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2252.246s">I</a> do think that we should have a removal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2256.112s">The</a> one that's from the Human Rights Commission is quite simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2259.557s">It</a> just says they can be removed for cause by a majority of the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2267.79s">So</a> that's something that I would consider recommending after hearing from other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2274.932s">But</a> I would also love to, I don't know if this is a good time for public comment before making a motion or if you want to make all the changes in a motion before we take public comment.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2289.907s">Well,</a> I would make some very minor but specific recommendations, like the committee shall consist of between five and 10 Medford residents, rather than of five Medford residents and up to 10 members total, but leave the rest of it that says the demonstrated expertise, that one person, the Medford residency would not be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2314.464s">So</a> I might make that suggestion and then <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2317.973s">I</a> would add an ability to remove if, you know, voted on by the whole commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2327.038s">So</a> those are the kinds of things, the things that I've already mentioned are the things that I would maybe make some recommendations for, but it might be informed by public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2335.583s">So</a> I would be happy to take public comment first.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2416.402s">So</a> there is a tree inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2418.042s">It</a> was done, I believe, last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2420.883s">And</a> the administration is still, the DPW is still working on being able to keep the tree inventory completely updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2429.925s">So</a> they're working through the process of having that be part of staff duties.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2758.933s">I</a> appreciate that final question, and I am going to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2761.694s">I</a> actually, um, I feel quite strongly that the changes that were made were not changes that, um That lessened the impact of the tree committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2776.0s">I</a> think, um <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2778.523s">In</a> many cases, what happened was it became clear to me through long discussions with Commissioner McGibbon that in the case of the tree inventory, it actually was not possible for the tree committee to do that work because we talked in detail about exactly what that work would mean and who would be where at what moment in time when that needed to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2805.141s">So</a> for that specifically, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2808.742s">really</a> it does need to be done by staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2812.088s">I</a> think in the other circumstances, for example, the very last one, it really was just a question of <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2822.091s">You</a> know, these are things that that are being done and and it wasn't even the desire of the folks writing the tree committee ordinance to take it away from the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2833.282s">It</a> was simply kind of a little bit of a misunderstanding, but that this work is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2837.547s">This</a> is the intended placement and replacement of trees and what they wanted was to be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2843.653s">So</a> I don't feel that it is weakened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2847.816s">I</a> just feel that it fits more closely with, because I don't think those conversations, the deep conversations between the forestry department and the writers of this ordinance had happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2858.623s">So</a> I think it's quite strong and I'm really excited for the tree committee to come into existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2864.947s">I</a> think it's gonna be a fantastic help. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2867.389s">The</a> truth is we have an incredibly small forestry division. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2871.712s">And</a> so it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2873.323s">When</a> we talk about accountability, it's really more like many hands make light work. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2877.384s">We</a> need more people who can just kind of have their eyes on things and be available to do things, to show up at the hearings, to review things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2885.587s">Our</a> staff is very, very busy doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2889.028s">And</a> so having some folks that can be there to sort of help with management and help with education efforts and all of that, I think is gonna be incredibly helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2897.551s">So</a> that was my first. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2899.291s">My</a> first one, I wonder if we could, I'm gonna make a couple of motions or I could make it in one motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2910.781s">So</a> I'm going to suggest that we change the last line of the last sentence in appointments letter A to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2935.029s">something</a> like, if possible, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2944.374s">And</a> up for discussion, Medford residency not required for youth members. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2955.459s">Maybe,</a> see what my fellow Councilors think of that before we put it in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2961.697s">And</a> then I would take a quote, I would add a bullet point about removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2972.103s">And</a> I would say tree committee members may be removed only for cause by a two thirds vote of the commission, including for unexcused absence that exceed 25% of the number of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2987.365s">that</a> the committee has held within a 12-month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2989.046s">That's</a> directly out of the Human Rights Commission ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=2996.01s">So</a> I would add that line in case we have a large tree committee and they're not able to take votes because of absences.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3023.379s">Should</a> we add something about, oh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3029.484s">My</a> third one, and please let me know if people have any comments before I write them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3036.683s">if</a> you have any immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3039.324s">But</a> under C, it says upon formation of the Medford Treat Committee, two members will be appointed for a term of three years, two members will be appointed for a term of two years, and one member, what I would say is one third of the members shall be appointed for a term of three years, one third of the members shall be appointed for a term of two years, and the last third shall be appointed for a term of one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3058.907s">That</a> way, if we appoint nine members or 12 members or however many, if we appoint more, then they're evenly distributed between the three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3068.273s">I</a> will email you those changes.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3320.345s">So</a> I'm about to send this email. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3322.326s">What</a> I have is the committee A, the committee shall consist of between five and 10 Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3326.789s">So</a> that's a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3328.329s">And</a> then before the last sentence, if possible, two youth members.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3335.096s">Oh,</a> sure.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3336.137s">The</a> committee shall consist of between 5 and 10 Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3339.639s">One</a> appointment made by City Council and all additional appointments made by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3346.263s">If</a> possible, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3353.068s">Do</a> you have language for the youth members being in an institution that is?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3400.245s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3409.954s">I</a> am sending it now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3557.179s">Motion</a> to approve and send to City Council.<h2><a href="../2025-06-10_a519TYOBRJE/2025-06-10_a519TYOBRJE.html">City Council 06-10-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1179.225s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1179.585s">This</a> was a meeting with we invited our facilities manager Paul Riggi to come out and talk about our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1186.328s">We</a> have requested that he present us both with a spreadsheet of all of the buildings and some information about those within the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1196.511s">and</a> then within the next month, he's also gonna, or a couple of months, he will also get us an estimate for how much it will cost to get a true long-term planning document about our facilities to understand the state and the cost to repair each of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1215.016s">And</a> I move to approve.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1783.348s">Yes,</a> do you know if it will affect any trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1786.429s">The</a> placement of the pole and the placement of the wires?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3367.334s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3370.015s">So,</a> as I think many of my fellow City Councilors, I also feel that we are relatively powerless in this situation, which I'm not happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3382.96s">I</a> really appreciate the work of Councilor Lazzaro in <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3387.762s">talking</a> to our police chief and getting an understanding from our police what they feel capable of doing, what they feel that they can do, what they are willing to do, and I'm very appreciative of that behind-the-scenes work. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3406.609s">I</a> do think that this will be really important for people, and my hope is that we <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3412.772s">you</a> know, the reports are that there is not a lot of ice activity and that people then feel more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3419.98s">But</a> of course, if there is, I think that is also very important for the public to know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3425.065s">My</a> only request was going to be, which I believe Councilor Collins also just put into her request, that it's specified that it is done at a City Council meeting so that it can be <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3434.675s">to</a> be part of the public record because I think that's that's a to me almost the most important part of what this request is about is about getting this information to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=3444.04s">Um</a> so thank you so much for this work that you're doing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6556.545s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6557.486s">It</a> is my understanding that the last time the National Guard was brought into a state to assist was with the permission of the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6564.751s">It</a> was in 1992, during the Rodney King riots. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6567.593s">There</a> were many millions of dollars of property damage, and I believe there were quite a few deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6573.337s">And</a> it was requested by the governor to aid and assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6578.66s">Far,</a> far worse had happened, certainly than anything we're seeing in Los Angeles right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6586.383s">There</a> is no permission from the governor of California right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6588.924s">And</a> the last time that the National Guard was sent in to any state without the permission of the governor was, I believe, after the Civil Rights Act.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6602.729s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6603.809s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6604.749s">In</a> Alabama, 1965, to enforce the Civil Rights Act, it is <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6611.722s">truly</a> bizarre and disturbing that this is happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6619.684s">And</a> again, I really have to echo some of my fellow Councilors in saying that I don't think that it helps us to sit by and try to not be noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6635.447s">I</a> think at this point, despite our <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6639.141s">not</a> having power at the national level or at the state level, I think that it is important that we speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6643.923s">Thank</a> you for putting this together.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=7521.548s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=7522.168s">My</a> only was a friendly amendment, which is just what you said, which is to send it to the Public Works and Facilities Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=7527.351s">We</a> have good discussions there, which include residents, as well as talking to staff.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9281.168s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9282.349s">Um</a> so I have been asking about this sort of behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9286.471s">I'm</a> gonna just be more public now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9289.553s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9290.914s">I</a> understand that it's important for the city to have certain savings accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9295.737s">The</a> stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9296.798s">I</a> understand that we need to maintain certain amounts of money in those accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9302.201s">Um</a> and if there's a certain amount that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9310.93s">I</a> believe that we should not be seeing more than $20 million in excess of those accounts just lying around not being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9320.277s">And</a> what I hope to see from the administration is, so this basically says, well, there's $550 million in existing needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9329.343s">Like,</a> wow, it's so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9330.844s">I</a> don't wanna see the $550 million in needs that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9336.147s">I</a> want to understand how much of free cash needs to be maintained <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9340.589s">because</a> it is a smart move to maintain it, because that is what we need in order to keep our bond rating good and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9348.237s">And</a> I want to have an idea of how we're going to spend the rest of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9351.481s">I</a> mean, we had $28 million a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9356.406s">We</a> can't continue to put more money into, you know, I completely get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9362.324s">We</a> need to have a certain percentage of your budget that you have to have as free cash at the end of every year, and I completely approve of conservative budgeting so that we do every year have some free cash like coming back into that free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9376.142s">We</a> can't just not spend it because <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9379.857s">The</a> way that certain things work, like our roads and other maintenance projects, the longer you allow them to become more and more dilapidated, then it costs 50 times as much to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9389.74s">We</a> can't just let this money sit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9391.36s">And</a> so that, I think, is what Councilor Lazzaro was trying to say, that the money isn't doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9396.882s">And</a> there are things more important that it could be doing and it should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9401.003s">So</a> what I would like to see is, I get it if some of this free cash should remain as <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9407.746s">uh</a> you know in stabilization funds or even in the free cash account if there are reasons why that those should remain there i understand but i think we we shouldn't be taking i mean since i've gotten on the council it's a year and a half we don't have a plan for the <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9422.233s">tens</a> of millions of dollars in free cash that we have, we need to have a plan so that money can be used in a way that is smart and means that in the future we have to spend less money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9435.005s">Those</a> are things, like roads in particular, I just find it hard to believe that letting <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9443.189s">plus</a> million dollars in free cash sit around is better for the city than spending that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9448.993s">For</a> example, on roads, and I also understand that if we're going to be spending on roads, we're going to increase our spending on roads, then we have to hire more engineers like these things can't happen immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9458.179s">I</a> get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9459.36s">But</a> to see this, a year later, that there isn't a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9464.243s">that</a> to me seems overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9467.044s">And</a> I would love to, I would actually love to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9470.504s">And</a> I thought this was what Councilor Lazzaro was asking for when she said timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9474.825s">What</a> I would like is not just a timeline for like when we're spending the money, I'd like a timeline for when can we see the thing I just described? <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9482.066s">When</a> can we see that the administration has a plan for how much of this $22.12 million remaining is going to be reserved <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9491.479s">because</a> I understand that, and there may be unknown expenses, there may be other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9496.161s">I</a> get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9496.861s">That's</a> what we have the stabilization funds for. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9500.663s">But</a> I want to know timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9502.104s">By</a> the end of the summer, will we have an understanding of how this $22 million is going to be spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9508.066s">What</a> is the timeline for us seeing a plan for free cash, including one for reserving some of it as savings?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9635.078s">yes,</a> staffing is absolutely, I completely understand that those are issues, but you can't start staffing if you don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9641.681s">So,</a> the having of a plan, I think, is the thing that I'm looking for the timeline on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9646.304s">So,</a> I appreciate that you think that, you know, at the end of the summer is when we'll be able to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=9650.486s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10304.158s">I</a> forgot to ask a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10306.26s">So</a> more than half of this $550 million is the water and sewer infrastructure work plus the lead line replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10314.405s">And</a> I just wanted to ask how much of that, like we have the water and sewer enterprise fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10324.772s">How</a> much do you think we will be using other savings accounts to work on one or both of those two items?

Hello? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1146.574s">There</a> you go, you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1147.654s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1491.011s">Sorry,</a> this is just, you've just been sort of rattling off some events that happened and I don't have the budget numbers right in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1503.159s">I</a> mean, I'm sure there is a budget for the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1505.021s">Would</a> you like us to follow up with the administration to figure out what the budget is?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1517.118s">So</a> it sounds like $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1517.958s">Let</a> me just ask the $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1522.202s">Was</a> that for this fiscal year so that that would be from last July 1 until ending in June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1529.829s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1530.39s">So</a> that would mean that was since we're three quarters of the way through that year, that maybe there would be $25,000 left. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1535.014s">That</a> was all he had. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1538.537s">That's</a> what he told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1539.418s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1539.919s">But</a> it sounded I mean, I look, I wasn't at that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1543.823s">I</a> mean, I'm really just going off of what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1545.485s">It</a> sounds like there are twenty five thousand dollars remaining in the budget and there is a quarter of the year left to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1553.614s">So</a> that doesn't sound particularly odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1556.436s">But</a> again, I don't have like I was not I did not realize if you'd asked I could have prepared and had the budget at this meeting, like with all those numbers and knowing what everything had been spent out of that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1570.586s">I</a> did not realize that that was what you were going to be asking about today.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1575.429s">Well,</a> my main reason for coming here was to get additional lighting for the balcony, so that great and that that was what I understood that you had some requests of things that you wanted done which, you know, we're happy to, you know, pass along but I think if you want a deeper understanding of what's going on with the budget like we can do that it just might take a little bit of time I'm going to go to Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1600.373s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1600.633s">My</a> bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1601.754s">You're</a> number five? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1604.875s">I'm</a> gonna tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1606.256s">Oh,</a> who's requesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1607.056s">Did</a> I get you?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1696.534s">So</a> by the way, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1698.575s">Today,</a> at six o'clock, we will have the Chevrolet theater budget on the, so if you just stick around, then you will hear the presentation of the budget for the Chevrolet theater so who's going to present that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1711.864s">Good</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1713.405s">And</a> by the way, also, I believe Paul Riggi is on Zoom and has raised his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1717.648s">So</a> shall we go to him? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1718.929s">Is</a> that all right if we go to him? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1719.85s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1720.13s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1720.991s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1723.333s">Can</a> you? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=1729.158s">We're</a> asking you to unmute.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2189.522s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2255.916s">If</a> I may, the Hager Center is actually not on the agenda and I really am interested in understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2262.38s">I</a> thought that you would be giving us the state of the Chevrolet, and I know you specifically wanted to talk about the facility.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2595.797s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2596.117s">And</a> I still do want to ask, aside from the lighting, it seems like the lighting is on people's radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2601.642s">Are</a> there other needs that you see in terms of the facilities, things that you would like to happen in the near future? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2608.428s">Are</a> there other needs that you see in the Chevrolet?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2644.034s">So</a> it sounds like there is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2645.715s">Could</a> you maybe repeat? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2647.055s">Did</a> you catch that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2648.816s">Mr.</a> Clerk, thank you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2718.117s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2722.499s">Is</a> there any more discussion on this particular topic?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2740.845s">I</a> was just fast.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2758.558s">Is</a> there anything further that you want to discuss about the state of LA?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2858.18s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2858.761s">Do</a> we have a motion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2865.58s">By</a> Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2869.563s">Clerk,</a> please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ih-_-yl5i8&t=2870.244s">When</a> you're ready.<h2><a href="../2025-05-14_v1jzPrb1DFs/2025-05-14_v1jzPrb1DFs.html">Medford City Council Meeting via Zoom</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2116.762s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2118.063s">Do</a> you have a date <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2120.577s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2121.017s">And</a> I, if I may also remind people, not just that we have the senior center ones, but that we do listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2128.28s">So</a> I want people to understand that we do listening sessions and for folks, you know, who maybe do not come to city council meetings, you know, the purpose is really to hear from folks who are not coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2141.824s">So</a> just for residents to understand that, and if you have suggestions, we would love to hear them. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2145.845s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2196.4s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2196.7s">It</a> really pretty much speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=2198.241s">I</a> was talking to them and they suggested that they come here to City Council so that we could just get the word out about the services that they offer.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7322.178s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7323.558s">This</a> is a very exciting project. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7325.339s">I'm</a> really quite happy to see these plans coming together after so many years of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7331.901s">Just</a> a few comments and then a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7335.202s">I</a> know that in one of the master plans, there really was an analysis of Medford Square and the very specific types of businesses that we have there and the difference between the types of businesses that we have and the types of businesses that create a really walkable, safe, <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7350.487s">a</a> kind of vibrant square that I think everyone here talks about and wishes for. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7355.411s">And</a> many people even look back to 30, 40 years ago with warmth about how it used to be more that way when there were bookstores and other places that people frequented. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7367.479s">So</a> I say that because I'm very excited about the grocery store coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7371.742s">I'm</a> also very excited to see a coffee shop coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7376.205s">And,</a> and I really also do appreciate all the work that you do in talking specifically to developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7382.571s">I</a> recently got, you know, an email from a resident, asking if they can if we can stop a bank from coming into Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7391.8s">Because</a> they they're like we can't have more banks and insurance companies and places where you don't you know need to go or enjoy to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7400.662s">And</a> please, I hope no one is offended by my mention of those two specifically but I think there are there are many in Medford Square that are. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7411.151s">not</a> the types that were identified in that master plan as being ones that are going to create the vibrancy we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7418.173s">So</a> I do appreciate all of the work that you are doing too, because we cannot simply dictate as a city council what people rent to and what businesses come in, but we can talk to developers and try to encourage them to bring certain types of businesses in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7434.738s">So</a> I appreciate all your work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7438.257s">I</a> did want to mention also that I think one of the benefits, and I think this came up in a conversation that we had about this particular project, one of the benefits of having a garage that is not underneath the residential units, that is actually a small bit away and maybe you have to cross the street, is that I certainly hope that the residents who move in will <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7467.45s">hesitate</a> to jump in their cars just a little bit more and be more likely to walk to walk into Medford Square, we're talking, you know, obviously, those who are young and able to do that, but hoping that people that this creates naturally just a little bit more of a walkable square. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7487.457s">and</a> lowers our need for like people get very concerned about the traffic that's caused by new development and new residents moving in and new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7498.688s">And</a> I hope that that will be a little bit ameliorated by the fact that the garage is not underneath <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7504.733s">the</a> building of the residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7506.134s">So</a> I really appreciate that as a very thoughtful way to approach some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7511.196s">I</a> had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7513.017s">One</a> is about the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7514.838s">And</a> I do understand that there are a lot of some of the seniors who are concerned that the senior center parking will not be as large. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7524.362s">And</a> I'm curious if any of the parking will be designated for seniors or <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7529.284s">how</a> many of those spots will be designated as handicapped spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7533.085s">That</a> might also help for those seniors who really do need to have a spot that is very, very close to the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7541.907s">If</a> we have a larger number of handicapped spots because it is directly across the street from the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7547.808s">So</a> I wanted to ask about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7549.829s">And</a> then this is more my curiosity about your opinion based upon a lot of the zoning that we have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7556.59s">But</a> my second question is really about step <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7559.111s">a</a> step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7560.432s">So</a> looking at the sort of envisioning diagram that they, the picture that they painted of what it might look like when standing in the memorial garden, that it does create a little bit of a sort of a corridor, like one of these wind tunnels of height. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7576.38s">And</a> I was curious, because in my mind, the step backs where you start off <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7582.183s">like</a> coming up from the sidewalk, but then the top couple of floors are actually backed away, that that might help to reduce a little bit of that feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=7591.911s">And</a> I was curious about what your thoughts were about that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9677.546s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9677.787s">I</a> really appreciate the constituent who is bringing up the specifics of the affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9685.473s">I</a> just wanted to make a short comment, which is that if you actually run the numbers, I will say I was a little surprised that 80% of AMI is 92,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9694.18s">That's</a> higher than I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9699.243s">And</a> if you run the numbers at 92,000, 30% of that per month is 2,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9705.085s">And</a> I assume that's one person, so it'd be a one bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9709.406s">I'm</a> making a guess because between 92 and 132K, which you said was one person and four person, 80% of AMI, making a guess for two people that it's around 108. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9721.208s">I</a> don't know if that's accurate, but something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9725.189s">that</a> would that would be around like 2700 a month for a two bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9728.551s">I'm</a> just like actually running the numbers and these numbers don't, to me appear to be much different from market rate.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9740.835s">Well,</a> hang on, hang on. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9744.336s">So</a> and I understand that you're saying market rate for new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9749.818s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9751.872s">I</a> just want us to be sensitive to the fact that if this is close to market rate for a lot of our existing housing, then calling this affordable when it's new construction, I just want us to be sensitive to this idea that
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9781.872s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9782.313s">And,</a> and I think that is in fact what I'm bringing up which is, I think that people in the city want <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9789.357s">colloquially</a> affordable housing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9791.557s">They</a> don't want something that fits the legal definition of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9795.178s">If</a> it's not actually creating more housing in our city, that is gonna be affordable for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9800.139s">I</a> mean, even at 80% of AMI, let alone what the constituent was mentioning of people who aren't at 80% AMI. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9807.781s">Like</a> I hope that we can consider having some steps or something, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9815.062s">And</a> I know it's conversation, but I think actually looking at the numbers and being open with the public about what numbers we are looking at and whether we're creating lowercase a, colloquially understood to be affordable housing, I think is an important discussion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9904.69s">And</a> I, and I don't disagree that like we also have a very specific issue in Medford which is we have a lot of older folks, we have the largest of my understanding from the Senior Center, and the Council on Aging is that we have the largest proportions or cohort of seniors that we have ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9921.299s">And</a> a lot of them, especially I've talked to tons of them they live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9926.543s">They</a> live in a four or five bedroom home and they're by themselves or with two people and they don't actually even want that, but there's nowhere in Medford to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9934.233s">So</a> I appreciate that this will resolve that issue, but I think creating affordable housing is its own <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9941.804s">question,</a> and that I would love for the City Council and the Planning Department and the Mayor and everyone to sort of grapple with in a real way, that I hope we aren't just creating more housing and hoping that that theoretically resolves a lot of our problems, but that we actually make some efforts to create <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9962.479s">affordable</a> housing in the different variety of ways that it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9965.662s">And</a> I don't necessarily mean create as in built. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=9967.844s">I</a> just mean that, you know, whether that's the Royal Community Land Trust, whether that's the Affordable Housing Trust, whether, you know, there's many avenues, I think, doing our best to create housing that is lowercase a affordable is something that I hope we can
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=11194.689s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=11196.83s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=11197.311s">So,</a> this $5,500, is this adding to a fund to make this happen, or is that the whole amount to make this happen?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=11245.989s">I</a> will say it does strike me that like this project is like $5,000 and replacing the HVAC system in the school is $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=11255.732s">I</a> mean, I understand that these things are real, but like, wow.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2743.665s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2745.026s">I'm</a> so excited about the neighborhood community hubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2747.147s">It's</a> been my favorite part of zoning so far of everything that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2754.672s">And</a> just my sort of initial thoughts about the types of businesses that would be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2762.057s">And</a> I think this is, I'm not married to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2765.379s">I</a> think it's totally up for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2767.86s">But</a> I would, I think with the concept that, <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2772.285s">These</a> are going to be within a half mile of every home. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2775.247s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2775.727s">And</a> so there's a there's a limited sphere of no parking right so the concept is really this is for people to walk to to make us a more walkable city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2785.312s">I</a> think I would lean toward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2788.353s">choosing</a> businesses that can survive on that amount of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2794.821s">And</a> by that, I kind of mean another way to think about it is that these businesses should be the kind of businesses that any one family might go to multiple times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2806.095s">So</a> I think to me that means co-working. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2808.396s">I</a> want to make sure we get co-working in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2810.036s">I</a> didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2810.596s">I</a> want to make sure that co-working is absolutely in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2813.357s">Co-working,</a> coffee shops, bookstores, kids activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2821.339s">You</a> know, I think there are places that, you know, laundromat, sure, but I think there are places where <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2828.368s">you</a> might go multiple times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2831.57s">I</a> think a store that people go to only once every three months or so, like perhaps, you know, a hair salon, and I could be wrong about this, so, you know, maybe people who know more about that particular business model, I think if their primary, if we have them everywhere in the city and their primary people are only within a half mile, they may not have enough <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2852.985s">business</a> to survive, which is why I'm trying to think, like, what are the, what are the businesses, like a bakery, you know, like, I mean, we stopped by there, we walked by it every day on our way to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2862.889s">And</a> sadly, it means that I eat a lot of pastries because we can't help. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2866.971s">We</a> got to just walk in, you know, we got to get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2870.373s">So</a> I hope we can think carefully about the kinds of businesses that we think will survive and will do well if in fact they are within a half mile of folks and don't have parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2885.864s">If</a> it's truly like the design is that it's for the people who can walk there and we want to have small ones but scattered throughout the city so that everybody has their local ice cream shop, everybody has their local <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=2896.811s">you</a> know, co-working space, their local coffee shop, where they see their neighbors, and it really gives us this feeling of this neighborhood feel, where people get to know the folks that live within a half mile, mile of them.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4502.47s">Yeah,</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4504.091s">I</a> would love it if somebody could give like a slightly different definition of the different types of districts, like overlay, the two kinds of overlays. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4512.514s">And</a> like, I will admit, I haven't really understood how they differ in terms of our decision making and where they will allow the businesses and who can, you know, so if I can have like maybe someone take a stab at that explanation, that would be really helpful.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4602.876s">And</a> if I can ask, is that still laying on top with very specific, like these plots of land, only these plots of land, or is it a little more lucid than that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4713.624s">The</a> one question I've been most curious about is, could one of those triggering things be, it is more than a quarter mile from the nearest neighborhood, other neighborhood commercial?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4812.531s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4812.811s">That's</a> super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4813.792s">And</a> kind of exciting, I think, if you know, include like artisan, like, I like that kind of what was a glassblower stained glass or something that exists, like if we include the sort of artisanal stuff there, then what's exciting to me is like, if it's more than a quarter mile from any of the nearest one, then you who could be a glassblower could, you know, convert your <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4836.902s">your</a> first floor into an artisan's space, and then maybe next door it'll be a coffee shop, like allowing residents to use their own creativity to be able to use their spaces for these kinds of things, I think would be a lovely organic way to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4857.209s">Or</a> somebody who loves baking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4858.51s">They'd</a> be like, I'm gonna use my garage, it's gonna become a bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4862.631s">Wouldn't</a> that be cool? <a href="https://youtu.be/mde-MlDPW-g&t=4863.512s">It'd</a> be super cool.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2783.496s">So</a> if we don't, I'll state my opinion anyway, without that information, I do think that the Human Rights Commission is primarily a, well, correct me if I'm wrong, maybe I should look through all of the work that they're going to do, but I think that they really are in a position to speak out <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2803.323s">And</a> that is one of the primary things that they do is to ensure that the voices of people who are, you know, marginalized or <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2813.44s">you</a> know, especially in today's world, under the Trump administration, there are a lot of people who are in precarious positions, and to ensure human rights, you know, violations, and to ensure that those people can be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2831.014s">And</a> so I'm more reluctant to allow those people, someone with that primary role to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2838.24s">that</a> I am for people in a different role where their role is to protect trees or their role is to approve zoning advances or to do other things where they're sort of have a different role aside from speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2853.655s">So</a> I'm leaning against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2856.538s">That's</a> kind of where I'm sitting right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3442.601s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3442.922s">After</a> hearing from folks, I feel I think even more strongly that I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3450.1s">I'm</a> not in favor of the amendment, so I'm perfectly happy if we say that the City Council may request the agency remove any of their own appointees and the mayor may request that the agency remove any of their appointees, but not that they have the ability to do so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3470.283s">Yep.</a>

They're not elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3824.113s">They</a> already have elected bodies to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3826.275s">So</a> to me, this is a very clear thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3828.576s">And</a> I just want to, like, I would be in support of it saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3834.581s">But</a> that isn't what I read here.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3852.795s">Technically,</a> it does say they shall be empowered to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve social equity in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3862.578s">But</a> what she is saying is they cannot advocate for laws, policies, practices that support human rights and improve social equity in Massachusetts or the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3873.221s">Well,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3877.562s">I</a> think to say that the Human Rights Commission cannot come up with their own opinions on human rights outside of our cities is going to rule out probably nine-tenths of everything they want to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3894.85s">In</a> my opinion, if you live in Medford, it doesn't mean you don't have a sister in some other state and a parent in another country or an entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3907.437s">And</a> that's what human rights are about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3910.219s">So</a> I definitely feel very uncomfortable if they cannot simply advocate for or put their own opinion and say that the Human Rights Commission itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3920.427s">They're</a> not saying the city does. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3921.648s">They're</a> saying the Human Rights Commission is, and that's what they're there to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3925.511s">This</a> is what I would like for the Human Rights Commission to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3929.114s">So</a> that's my opinion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4244.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4244.686s">Um</a> so I would if I were reading this, I would think that Cindy Watson already appeared on 4 29 and she has only been invited on May 5 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4254.432s">I</a> would just remove the whole section because the meeting is going to happen on 5 20.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4261.877s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4262.998s">Aside</a> from that, it's beautiful.<h2><a href="../2025-06-04_nSVrs1f-rd8/2025-06-04_nSVrs1f-rd8.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 05-04-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1166.384s">It's</a> like- I only mentioned it because this is the kind of thing like restaurants staying open until one is a kind of thing that occasionally some residents are not happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1174.229s">So</a> I know they're kind of a part, they're not in a residential area, so it's probably fine, but- They are in the first floor of a building where people live, so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1524.233s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3737.782s">That's</a> it.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2518.869s">How</a> long would it take you to write up a one or two page document that essentially laid out the difference between keeping the software we have and moving to the new software, both in terms of like upfront costs, long term costs, like at what point we would sort of break even or begin to be saving money if we move to the new software, how much <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2542.649s">work</a> it would be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2543.89s">Do</a> you think that you could put that into a one or two page document and would it be terribly burdensome for you?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2569.618s">I</a> just wonder if, because, you know, I hear all these names of different software is going around and then all this different amounts of money and, and I, I have trouble wrapping my head around it if it's not like written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2581.164s">So</a> I would really appreciate that I don't know if that's something that you know that Council feels is worth, worth the time of the staff time to like put together like a one page doc just of the basic outlines, but I would appreciate that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2611.936s">I</a> am happy to make that motion unless anybody has in particular, before I begin making a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2617.118s">Is</a> there anybody who's like, no, don't do it, because I'm happy to make that motion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2671.672s">perhaps</a> I put a due date of July 31st to make it so it's not like during budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2678.958s">If</a> you can finish budget season and then you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2680.579s">It's</a> always budget season in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2681.68s">I</a> know, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2682.681s">I</a> don't know if that's helpful.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2757.412s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2758.232s">In</a> which case, I would love to make a kind of simple motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2762.334s">I'm</a> not going to put a ton of details in because I think you understand what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2766.676s">And</a> the motion is that we request a document outlining what it would take for Medford to update our financial software.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2795.641s">That's</a> fine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2796.562s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2796.902s">By</a> September, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2798.202s">I</a> think it's fine as long as it's this year.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1032.75s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1034.331s">I</a> do not want to play any favoritism for our public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1037.073s">I</a> love them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1037.913s">We</a> are in one now, but I will also say the Chevalier Theater is, of course, so much more than just a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1045.078s">And,</a> you know, what they bring to our city is truly wonderful in terms of events, as well as just, you know, economic vitality and what they bring to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1055.765s">So</a> I'm very excited to have them come again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1058.887s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1060.528s">you</a> know, they they have some requests in terms of the actual physical building. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1065.57s">And</a> I'm excited to hear what they look for, and what the city might be able to help them out with.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3652.054s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3652.274s">I</a> have to say, I have attended one of the Boston Glory games at Hartmell Stadium with my kid, and it was amazing to see all these kids like racing back and forth down the edge of the field with these gigantic flags going by. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3664.546s">And</a> of course, the Frisbee was also good. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3667.589s">I</a> enjoyed it very much, and I highly recommend it to everybody.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4109.19s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4109.951s">Let</a> me know if I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4111.255s">reading</a> this correctly, that the one that we approved before, which is for a loan for $5 million with the estimated total project to be an additional $20 million, so $25 million total. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4123.585s">And</a> then in this one, it says the $5 million still, but that the total project cost instead of being $25 million looks like $30,775,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4133.772s">And</a> because it looks more detailed, perhaps there has already been some planning or a little bit better estimation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4139.133s">Is</a> that just the, am I correct in that that is an increase in the guesstimate on the total project cost or am I being that wrong or?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4170.609s">That's</a> basically all I wanted to know, was this is a sort of updated project cost?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4204.711s">If</a> they feel that what you said is accurate, that's all I was asking was like, this is like an updated amount from that original one that we've passed back in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4260.421s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4948.813s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4949.834s">I</a> appreciate the, you know, noticing that this is a big number. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4954.756s">And</a> I will say that when I was going over this item with some of my volunteers that helped me to go through what's on the city council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4964.181s">We</a> all noticed that this was a big number and one of my volunteers actually did a little bit of research and looked at what other cities have paid for <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4972.785s">you</a> know, things like replacing roofs on schools, things like HVAC systems on schools, things like, you know, replacing air conditioning or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4981.288s">And</a> while there was a fair-sized range, this number did not stand out as unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4987.37s">It</a> was not on the high end. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4988.691s">It</a> was not on the low end. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4989.711s">It</a> kind of sat in the middle of what other school districts do spend for this kind of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4995.733s">So</a> I think that's a, it's a perfectly reasonable question to answer, or to ask, and, and I, you know, we did ask and we looked around and least got sort of that sort of lay person's understanding of yes, this is what it generally costs in Massachusetts to do this kind of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5017.383s">Um,</a> and then the thing that I would like to say about free cash, um, and I echo other city councilors' statements that, um, you know, the Massachusetts state has, um, it has resources for city councilors to understand how to properly use, uh, their money, and it does say that it really <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5041.102s">No</a> city should be using free cash or stabilization funds for operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5048.348s">And</a> so this is why we had overrides was to increase our operating budget that we can spend, as people are saying, on ongoing expenses that we have to budget for every year and that if that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5060.919s">If</a> the amount of money ran out, we would be in deep trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5064.383s">So</a> that's the reasoning why it is not just people sitting in the city council that think that it is the state that thinks that it is the credit agencies that think that if you spend all of your free cash if you don't have free cash the end of each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5078.598s">then</a> if your amount of free cash gets too low, then your credit rating goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5083.741s">So</a> it is really important that we do these things correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5088.303s">But</a> what I'm also excited about with free cash is I'm really happy that we are spending <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5095.407s">$5</a> million of our free cash on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5098.429s">And</a> I really want to know from the administration, and I know that there's discussions happening between city councilors and city council leadership and the administration, but I am very excited to hear what the plans are for spending the amount of our free cash and capital stabilization funds that is above the recommended amount that we maintain in those funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5124.869s">Because</a> I do think we have more than the recommended amount that you need to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5129.953s">And</a> we obviously have capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5132.174s">Just</a> this one capital project would wipe out all of free cash if we use free cash for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5138.399s">Our</a> roads have tens of millions of dollars of road debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5142.762s">We</a> have many, many capital projects that need money. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5147.205s">So</a> we do not have more free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5150.587s">than</a> projects, and I am excited to understand better what the priorities are that the administration has for how to spend the free cash that we have that we could be spending in the near future that will still maintain a healthy level of free cash and stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5171.332s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6854.174s">Wonderful,</a> and I guess the sort of overarching question is, this is a routine thing that they do every 10-15 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6864.318s">From</a> my understanding, yes.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6870.341s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6870.822s">Given</a> the state of our national government, there was some question when looking at this about like, hmm, what is the meaning behind this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6880.09s">But</a> it sounds like this is just routine, updating the maps, updating language.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6890.199s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=7178.575s">Just</a> for those listening, can we have like a one-sentence reminder of what it is that we are citing?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=7241.245s">But</a> am I correct that this was one that one councillor asked for us to get a legal opinion on?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=364.065s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=365.327s">Just</a> on on this chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=367.109s">This</a> was really just for discussion only this is the 2024 numbers not the 2025 numbers, and mainly what I wanted to ask about before I run the 2025 numbers is I grade out and put in brackets, three items. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=380.947s">because</a> I want people to understand that those three items are not things that are under our control at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=388.271s">And</a> one is insurance, one is pensions, and one is bonds, bonds and interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=393.154s">And</a> I just wanted to, so we don't talk about it right this second, but like, so that you know, this is not like the final chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=398.977s">It's</a> really for us to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=401.078s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=416.295s">Do</a> we want to discuss the chart now?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=418.776s">I'm</a> happy to discuss the chart.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=540.67s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=540.99s">I'm</a> liking that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=543.351s">My</a> main question was, are those three the three that should be grayed out? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=547.192s">I</a> just want to make sure that everybody agrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=552.112s">Yes,</a> just the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=555.715s">In</a> my mind, those are the three that we just can't control them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=560.018s">And</a> so they're just unmovable.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=662.922s">Yep,</a> I can plan on doing that tomorrow.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1029.056s">Mr.</a> Chair.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1311.295s">And</a> I'm just curious why one to 15, and not one to 25.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1326.11s">I'm</a> just, I mean, I guess we won't know until people answer the question but like we might get zero like 11,000 a year like who earns. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1335.588s">Yeah,</a> I mean, well, I don't know maybe so many people.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1368.288s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1583.731s">This</a> isn't exactly a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1585.593s">It's</a> more, I don't know what it is, comment, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1590.357s">What</a> is the easiest way for you to participate in the budget process? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1594.72s">And</a> then it's like emailing your elected official, calling your elected official, or attending city meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1602.196s">If</a> I were a person who is not a city councilor, I would be like, wait, I have to email my city councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1611.583s">What</a> am I going to tell, what am I going to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1612.904s">Like,</a> what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1613.585s">Like,</a> it doesn't, I'm not sure what we can say there, but those three options, like attending city meetings, that at least makes sense to me because like you attend, <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1624.713s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1624.913s">And</a> then you get some information, but like emailing your elected official, like with no, it just seems like an impossible ask.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1742.677s">I</a> was excited by Councilor Lazzaros suggestions here was just what I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1748.695s">hoping</a> bringing this up would come to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1751.096s">I</a> love the idea also from Councilor Tseng of like first say, how are you keeping up to date? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1756.578s">And</a> then after that, I think we should use this to figure out what we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1760.74s">And</a> so attending regular city council meetings in the chambers, then we could say, you know, if we offered, you know, a listening session in the community, would you attend? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1773.606s">If</a> we offered a Zoom, <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1776.307s">special</a> budget Zoom meeting, would you attend? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1780.769s">Not</a> promising that we're going to do these things, but saying we're curious to see what interest there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1789.291s">If</a> we offered these things, would you attend?<h2><a href="../2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U/2025-04-15_j2zlMvp6B6U.html">Special Meeting of the Medford City Council 04-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1855.653s">Just</a> I think I'm really happy that you brought this up, I think term limits for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1863.311s">Like</a> fairly extended like eight terms that's a lot of time, I feel very comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1868.357s">I</a> also think that, you know, nobody should be able to start 32 years with a tiny two year break in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1874.463s">And</a> so I'm, I'm in favor also of taking up the consecutive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1878.087s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3549.353s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3551.774s">I</a> am not happy with how this process has gone for the charter in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3559.556s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Lazzaro's description of a two compromise where no one is happy with the product. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3565.277s">I</a> think that is also accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3568.838s">I</a> think that if we do not put the mayor back on the school committee, this charter will not make it to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3577.461s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6272.542s">Are</a> we going to vote on the charter approval before we vote on this one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6311.297s">Yeah,</a> there's the one that says both of the- Yeah, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6316.26s">So</a> that one is a little- I can highlight that one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6323.383s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6324.763s">Or</a> if you just want to say that- I just don't want to approve this if that language isn't there because we haven't taken it out yet.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3252.397s">On</a> Zoom.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3257.545s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure that we're not sending stuff to legal that we don't need to send to legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3262.186s">My</a> understanding from the building commissioner is that on that we are the appropriate body to make appeals and final decisions when it has already gone through the building department on things like signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3277.85s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3280.331s">I'm</a> not positive it doesn't need to go to legal, but I think we should not just send everything to legal just to send things to legal.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8317.903s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8319.925s">Yeah,</a> I think the most frightening thing to me is that it is very clear that people are being snatched off the street with absolutely no due process at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8334.295s">So</a> this question of someone who it has now come out is really innocent of anything, even being in this country illegally, who has been deported not to his home country, but to a prison in El Salvador that is renowned around the world for torture. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8352.068s">And</a> this person is not being recalled, even though it has now been made clear that they were not who the government thought that they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8360.897s">Seeing</a> Rumesa snatched off the street in that video was genuinely, should be frightening for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8373.546s">And</a> I think we should remember the famous poem from Nazi Germany that says, first they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8383.432s">Then</a> they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8387.894s">Then</a> they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8391.896s">And</a> then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8396.858s">So</a> anyone who feels safe should really just pause and think about what it means for people to be snatched off the street by people who do not have a warrant and are not declaring who they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8413.196s">with</a> absolutely no due process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8415.699s">I</a> think that that does not end well for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8419.304s">Anyone</a> here could be mistaken for someone else and shipped off to a gulag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8428.115s">So</a> I am very happy <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8431.125s">to</a> be on a city council that is doing everything that we can in this moment to try to protect our residents who are being targeted for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8442.833s">But</a> really, that ends with anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8446.556s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10952.642s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10954.204s">I</a> apologize for not being there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10955.645s">I</a> am sick and I did not want to get anyone all sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10960.392s">I</a> want to encourage anyone who was not at our last meeting to read my blog post. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10965.637s">I</a> have been interested in the nitty-gritty details of how democracies work, including different voting systems and wards versus districts versus at large and all that stuff for a long, long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10982.913s">So</a> if you want to know my full thoughts, that's on my blog at annakalahan.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10988.114s">The</a> short story is that both nationally and internationally, people who study democracy and democratic systems all are pretty much in consensus that single seat first past the post districts, which is what ward or district seats are, are known to be one of the worst at appropriately representing people's political views. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11011.248s">Now,</a> I want to mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11014.509s">So</a> I mean, I've been for 30 years, probably a person who believes that we that, you know, we're in a hybrid system, but one that is balanced, right, that does not have too many water district seats, and does not have too many at large seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11033.649s">I</a> know the Charter Study Committee did do a survey, and a lot of people are talking about, you know, what came out of the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11038.99s">I</a> want to remind us that there were 663 responses to that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11044.812s">So,</a> you know, I really am happy that they did a survey, and I know how hard they worked to get those responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11055.658s">I</a> will also comment that there never was a question asking how large the wards or district should be, whether we should have districts the same size as Somerville, which would be 4 or wards, which would be 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11068.124s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11070.785s">I'm</a> unconvinced that the community, from that particular survey that we can read out of that survey, that what everybody who answered those questions is that they wanted to have eight wards rather than districts the same size as other cities near us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11087.189s">I</a> will say one thing that we do know is that Medford voted strongly in favor of ranked choice voting in a statewide vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11094.91s">And</a> I think that over 10,000 people voted in that election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11098.955s">So</a> if we want to know what Medford actually thinks with confidence, we know that Medford wants rank-choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11106.477s">And</a> my concern is that by passing this, we are locking ourselves into a charter that won't allow us to have rank-choice voting for these single-seat first-past-the-post districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11120.04s">So</a> whether it's wards or districts, we will not be able to have rank-choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11124.941s">If</a> we had rank-choice voting, I would be happy to have eight and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11130.063s">But</a> the more districts that you have compared to at large, right, the greater percentage of awards you have, the more it is a problem when you have this first-past-the-post single-seat district. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11139.591s">And</a> when I say locking in, my understanding is, and I really hope that we can get a definitive answer to this, that if we pass this charter, that we will not be able to get a home rule charter for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11152.444s">So</a> I would like two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11155.166s">I</a> would like, number one, if anyone among the city council can answer the question of who do we need to ask to get a definitive answer about whether passing this charter is locking us out of having a rank choice voting <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11174.284s">a</a> home rule charter that allows for ranked choice voting within the next 10, 20, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11181.49s">I</a> want to know who we can ask to definitively answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11185.994s">And</a> then I would consider all of these amendments and things as long as we have one more week to work on this, as Vice President Collins suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11196.885s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11365.862s">No,</a> I believe Anthony Wilson did answer my question, but I am interested in the answer, excuse me, to that question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11371.448s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2151.273s">Great,</a> and to follow that up with, so it sounds like SenseN and GTEC, if I've got those correct, at some point, each of them has the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2160.919s">Do</a> you know if SenseN deletes the data once it is transferred? <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2163.621s">And</a> do you know if GTEC has any access to the data?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4721.569s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-04-03_zmO5WffK7aY/2025-04-03_zmO5WffK7aY.html">Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee Meeting via Zoom</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1686.482s">I</a> concur. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1687.342s">I</a> don't think we have to worry too much about consistency between them with something with a change as small as this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1798.211s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1799.752s">That</a> was like the one that we pulled in from Unfinished Business.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2232.109s">Just</a> one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2236.873s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2238.095s">Sometimes</a> we say the council or council and sometimes we say we. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2240.897s">That's</a> probably fine.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2247.043s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2247.423s">So</a> if you look under March 25th, we say council submitted, and later we say the council received, and then later we say we approved and we passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2255.686s">Should</a> we make it a little bit more consistent and either say the council or we?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2281.686s">I</a> am happy either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2283.167s">That's</a> what I'd ask.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2332.034s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2333.274s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3338.052s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3339.613s">So</a> I am going to make a suggestion, which is that we use this not only as an opportunity to get feedback, but as an opportunity to educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3351.16s">I</a> found that at one point during <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3356.232s">the</a> fall, it was incredibly educational for the people that I talked to, to actually see a pie graph of our budget and to understand which of the elements in that pie graph are things that are discretionary and which are things that we cannot change. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3369.198s">And</a> in fact, sometimes like insurance, which is our second budget item, our first is our school district and our second at 15% is insurance, that insurance in fact goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3381.219s">We</a> can't even keep it at 15% because it goes up by 10% this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3386.264s">So</a> I would love it if we could include <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3390.47s">a</a> little bit of education along with this and just have like a pie chart that shows our current budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3398.412s">And</a> maybe we can, I think this is the 2024, which is, you know, or 2020, whatever the fiscal year starts in, in, in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3407.154s">And</a> so I forget, is it the 2025 one, whichever is the current one. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3410.755s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3413.792s">I</a> have one that's colored, but I think what I would want to do is gray out the sections that are not discretionary, just to educate people on what parts of the budget do we actually have any ability to increase or decrease on our own, so that people have some idea of like what our budget actually looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3433.685s">Once</a> people see it, I think they often are like, oh, wow, like I had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3439.433s">And</a> they stop arguing about things like, you know, all the stuff in there that's like 0.5% of the budget, you know, they're less concerned with how much it costs to do these, you know, incredibly small departments that are very mighty in their ability to help our city.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3564.376s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3565.097s">By</a> the way, the Zoom is not responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3566.578s">It's</a> covering the whole screen here just so you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3570.34s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3570.82s">Zoom</a> is not responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3571.54s">It's</a> covering the whole screen so no one can see your screen anymore.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3576.964s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3577.564s">I'm</a> sitting at home.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3802.988s">So</a> I just have a question I'm excited to bring up in a public meeting so I can ask my fellow Councilors if anyone wants to work with me on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3811.532s">Many</a> years ago when I was the president of the board of a 432 person housing association, I did a participatory budgeting measure where I actually invited everyone who lived there to <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3833.083s">basically</a> put in like they got to see the exact budget and they, you know, got to <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3840.844s">make</a> their own adjustments to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3843.845s">And</a> it was advisory, but it got a lot of interest and it was very educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3850.829s">And</a> I wonder if any of my fellow city councilors would be interested in working with me to put together something similar that would allow our residents to really kind of dig into the budget and make their own recommendations as an advisory to our budgetary process.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3885.739s">I</a> just want to have a co sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3887.18s">So</a> if there's one person that can work with me on it I can kind of put it together and then.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3897.381s">Yeah,</a> exactly, like, put together, just somebody that we can put together a motion and then we can chit-chat about, like, how to put together the first draft so that when it comes to committee, we'll be able to... I'm personally happy to step in for that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3929.987s">I</a> mean, we're three members of the committee right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3931.789s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3932.87s">But</a> I'm just looking for somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3934.391s">I</a> just want to know who it is that I can work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3936.293s">I</a> think having one other co-sponsor and not two because we're all on this committee and it's going to come to this committee I think is best.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4256.777s">Yeah,</a> I would just add that the specifics of our city and the fact that we have, we don't have that many like giant apartment buildings, but we have a lot of like duplexes where one or both of those <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4273.232s">are</a> rented out, it is super hard to reach those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4277.176s">You</a> just can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4278.137s">It's</a> very, very, very difficult.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4322.398s">That</a> one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4549.33s">I</a> think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4550.25s">And</a> I'll provide, I'll bring my pie chart and I'll gray out the ones that are not, you know, actionable, not discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4558.075s">Um,</a> and we can vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4559.756s">We</a> like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4560.136s">I</a> should change colors and whatever.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4855.329s">To</a> schedule our next meeting, this committee's next meeting for two weeks from now.<h2><a href="../2025-04-01_kwBGhJnWGUU/2025-04-01_kwBGhJnWGUU.html">Public Health and Community Safety Committee Meeting via Zoom</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2100.665s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2100.885s">I</a> just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2102.426s">To</a> me, it actually looks like there aren't very many changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2105.687s">A</a> lot of these are simply a comment saying that it is consistent with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2110.569s">So</a> that is, you know, 1234567 just on the first page and almost all of the comments on the first page as well as in one of the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2120.372s">I</a> might be wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2122.233s">But</a> many of these what look like changes aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2125.314s">And</a> I wonder, could we go over just the substantive changes first? <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2130.037s">Would</a> that be okay?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3162.8s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3164.041s">You</a> notice one thing as I'm looking, so just below that, after D before E, all city agents shall comply with any state regulation pertaining to reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare, not otherwise explicitly stated in this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3179.07s">And</a> the change is all city employees and officials shall comply with any state or federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3187.803s">Clearly,</a> we understand the current state of federal actors and potential for federal law changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3201.245s">And</a> I wonder, was that state regulation very specific to not include federal regulation when it was originally written? <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3208.311s">Is</a> that something that we specifically want to keep and perhaps leave out federal law silently? <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3215.877s">Because</a> I don't think that's going to get us in any trouble just to not include the words or federal.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3890.605s">I</a> have something small, and I'm mostly just asking if this language means what I think it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3898.76s">under</a> the role of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3905.584s">So</a> the language changed from the police department of the city of Medford shall not to blah, blah, blah, no officer or employee of a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3919.712s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3920.697s">I'm</a> not a lawyer, I'm more of a layperson in terms of legalese. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3924.38s">To</a> me, a law enforcement agent of the Commonwealth is a state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3929.905s">So</a> I think what we're trying to say is the Medford Police Department, and the new language does not say that anymore.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3988.803s">Yeah,</a> why are we writing language for any random city in the Commonwealth? <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3993.226s">Like</a> we're Medford, we should only be talking about Medford.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4171.217s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4173.217s">So</a> my only thing about that is, I think in the city agent definition, it's kind of a little bit more encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4179.639s">It</a> says employee of the city, whether full-time or part-time, regular or seasonal, any intern or volunteer when acting on behalf of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4187.681s">And</a> I kind of like that definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4189.441s">And</a> I feel like it's a little bit more encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4191.101s">Is</a> there a reason to not go with that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4193.562s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4210.052s">But</a> shorten that, shorten it to that, just the beginning part of that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4223.887s">Yeah,</a> I'm of two minds of the contractor part. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4227.888s">I</a> think we might need to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4229.708s">I</a> don't know what we need to check, but I'm sure that first part, and I think we're all agreed that not the grants and the award, people who got an award. <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4239.49s">So</a> I think we're just in the middle section of the contract.<h2><a href="../2025-03-26_N657gyXQa48/2025-03-26_N657gyXQa48.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 03-26-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2467.952s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2469.033s">I</a> also support and I'm curious about the idea of having height next to 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2474.195s">So</a> in that parcel furthest to the east. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2478.297s">So</a> I mentioned the answer to that question from the planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2482.399s">I</a> also want us to look at the parcel furthest to or the parcels furthest to the west. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2487.782s">When</a> I look at the other map that you provided a number of meetings ago that shows the actual <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2494.605s">Current</a> zoning or not zoning but current like existing buildings that is marked as orange, which says condo conversion two to three family so I'm not sure exactly what buildings exist there at this moment that did not seem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2511.562s">to</a> go drive with my recollection of what buildings are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2514.484s">But</a> like understanding what height is there right now would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2518.046s">It</a> does, you know, that whole section abuts on multiple single family or like currently mostly single family places. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2524.95s">So</a> I'm a little bit curious about can we get more height close to 93 and maybe get something on the other side that's a little bit closer to match the residences that are just to the west and north of it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2879.201s">I'm</a> looking at the planning and permitting agenda from the 12th of February, which is an amazing one because it included a lot of maps, and this is one of those maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2888.445s">It's</a> just the one that shows like every parcel and what exists on that parcel, and it's marked as orange, which is condo conversion duty family. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2896.969s">Not</a> sure why.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4044.937s">I</a> really appreciated those look at the heights and the shadows. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4050.063s">The</a> one that I was curious about was the Salem Street one. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4056.109s">It</a> does appear that all of the others covered where the shadows would be on the north side for Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4066.681s">How</a> does it work as we're looking north of Salem Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4071.084s">When</a> we look at the housing that's north of Salem Street, and there's a road there, how does that? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4079.269s">I</a> think that wasn't covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4080.31s">Almost</a> everything else, it covers what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4085.834s">But</a> those buildings, which we're changing on the left side that you're circling right now, what about the housing that is on the other side of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4094.179s">That's</a> what I'm curious about.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4149.065s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4149.946s">Thanks</a> so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4416.201s">I</a> am just curious that the cemetery lot is zoned as mixed use.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5239.735s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5240.215s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5241.836s">I</a> know that when I looked at one of the Medford Square master plans, it talked about very, very specific types of businesses that we are lacking in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5257.782s">And</a> I should look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5259.903s">and</a> go back and recall more exactly which types of businesses those were. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5264.365s">But</a> I think it was things like more restaurants and less insurance companies or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5269.167s">Not</a> that I want to pick on insurance companies or anything, but more of the places where people go and walk in and less of places where people don't actually have to walk into that store on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5283.753s">So,</a> I'm curious if that is something that we do with zoning, or if that is something like, is there a micro zoning that you do in a place like Medford squared? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5291.858s">It</a> took to sort of try to incentivize the kinds of businesses that we want that are to be in the center of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5298.182s">Or</a> is that something that we rely upon our generally our planning department and our economic development director and those sorts of. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5307.388s">people</a> if we want to change the percentage of those types of businesses that we have in the square to make it a more vibrant and walkable square.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5722.245s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5722.725s">That's</a> actually incredibly helpful to hear what other communities do and that there is this possibility of, you know, like a economic district supported by a group of, you know, public and private, I suppose, might be a good <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5738.9s">name</a> for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5740.001s">That's</a> great to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5741.121s">And</a> thanks so much for elaborating on the usefulness of zoning in this particular thing and how we actually do it, which is not through zoning, but really through our staff and our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5751.748s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2025-03-25_rbGibzmLVpU/2025-03-25_rbGibzmLVpU.html">City Council 03-25-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3185.679s">I</a> guess my first question is, if this waits a week or two is that gonna be horrible like is there some is there some great urgency.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3408.657s">for</a> clarifying that we are in fact the appropriate body for this to come to after the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3412.72s">Given</a> that, I would actually prefer rather than paying the, I don't think we need to pay a legal team. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3417.604s">I</a> think that we want to honestly hear from the building department and whether they show up here or whether, you know, at the thing so we can ask them questions or whether, you know, we can have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3427.953s">Like,</a> I read it and it's like, they just want to change what's on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3432.156s">Like,</a> it seems like a no-brainer and I just want to understand from the building department, like, why is it that <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3438.315s">They</a> can't like I've read the legalese, but like I would love to have the building department chime in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6294.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6296.569s">I</a> definitely agree in the need for us to support to find money to do these, the nexus study so that we can update the linkage fees especially for affordable housing which I think we should do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6312.278s">I'm</a> absolutely supportive of that, but I will not vote in favor of selling off public lands, which we'd never get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6320.119s">when</a> we have $28 million sitting in free cash, let alone the money that is in stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6326.861s">I</a> cannot understand why we are selling off public lands when we clearly have many times that amount of money in free cash that we do not know what that is planned to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6339.225s">So</a> I will not vote to sell off public lands at this point in time.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7046.443s">First,</a> I completely agree that one-time expenses, just like this nexus fee, is exactly what Free Cash is designed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7054.546s">It</a> is what it should be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7056.347s">We</a> have plenty of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7057.368s">We</a> should be using free cash for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7058.948s">Once</a> you sell public lands, it is gone forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7060.889s">I</a> have yet to see that there has been any <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7065.451s">that</a> we're going to have to sort of brainstorming or real in depth study of what could be done with those parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7072.776s">Uh</a> it isn't simply that there could be permanently affordable housing on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7076.618s">There</a> are many other things that can be done with public lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7079.28s">Um</a> and II really urge my city Councilors to not rush through to sell public lands when it has not been thought through. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7088.146s">And</a> to urge the mayor to pay for the next study as soon as<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_DtNTjLLICLg/2025-03-18_DtNTjLLICLg.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-18-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1387.497s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1388.737s">So</a> I do support many of the other items that other folks have brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1392.958s">I'm</a> just going to talk about the two that I put in that have been projects that I have been working on for quite a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1401.88s">So</a> one of them is about the volunteer tree planting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1406.501s">I</a> have been working with folks in Trees Medford and also <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1413.442s">talking</a> to tons of volunteers about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1416.283s">We</a> did have the DPW commissioner come in to the committee to speak about what it would take to get this program off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1427.468s">And</a> let me just say a little bit about why it's important that, you know, we do lose about twice as many trees as we plant every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1435.291s">And</a> yes, we live, we, you know, a third of Medford is the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1437.872s">We</a> have lots of trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1438.793s">I</a> think if you <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1439.653s">you</a> know, live in the kind of northern part of Ward 6, you feel like there's lots and lots of trees, but if you live south of the river, you really, and especially if you've lived there for a long time, I talk to many people who say that they have lived on their street for decades, and it used to be a canopy of trees, and you look now, and it is barren. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1464.349s">This</a> depresses home prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1466.411s">It</a> causes us to have heat islands, makes people pay more for heating in the winter, for cooling in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1475.677s">There's</a> so many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1477.719s">It</a> doesn't clean our air from pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1479.28s">There's</a> so many reasons why we need to be replacing these trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1486.705s">Anecdotally,</a> you can just see on my street, not that my street is any more important than anyone's street, but on my street, you can see these little squares where there used to be a tree planted in front of every house. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1498.262s">And</a> now, on the whole block, there is one remaining tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1502.813s">So</a> I really believe that with our small budget in Medford, with our small budget and our mighty residents, mighty in their willingness to volunteer, I think that we can solve this problem with very little addition to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1523.424s">And</a> we can do it through activating our community and getting people involved in community events, meeting their neighbors, <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1530.388s">And</a> the DPW commissioner said that all it would take would be one staffer, like a halftime staffer, who was a volunteer coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1540.936s">So</a> that's my first request. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1543.158s">My</a> second request is a halftime person involved in housing to run a home sharing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1550.103s">And</a> again, I've been meeting with our housing person <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1553.746s">and</a> other, you know, many other residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1557.429s">You</a> know, we've been meeting for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1559.632s">We</a> have met with people who run the sort of national home sharing organization that helps people start home sharing programs in their cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1569.901s">I'll</a> tell you a little bit about the idea behind home sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1573.865s">In</a> our city, according to our senior center, I hope I am not incorrect if I'm not wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1581.891s">What</a> they said is that we have a larger percentage of seniors, people over 65 than we have ever had in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1590.877s">And</a> the reality is that many of those people live in houses that have four or five bedrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1597.662s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1598.973s">As</a> I have talked to seniors, both of the senior center, you know, as I was knocking on doors people that I, you know, interact with some of these folks that I've been meeting with many many seniors here in Medford would like to downsize or they are worried about aging in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1618.468s">but</a> they either, the rent is getting hard to, sorry, they could use a little bit more financial security or they need a little help around the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1629.31s">We</a> are not the only city facing this kind of issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1634.751s">It</a> is really interlocked with our housing crisis because 50 years ago, we had 9,000 more people living in the city with less housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1643.172s">So</a> our problem is that we have fewer people <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1648.593s">per</a> bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1649.894s">We</a> have one person living in a three-, four-, five-bedroom house, and that isn't how it used to be, and that isn't how it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1659.315s">So</a> we can really help both our seniors to help them to age in place help them to be financially comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1666.399s">And</a> we can also help our housing crisis by helping to solve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1671.801s">And</a> what a lot of other cities are doing is they're starting a home sharing program and it's a matchmaking service a very hand holding personalized matchmaking service that ensures <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1681.866s">that</a> older folks who have extra bedrooms can find a person who usually it's some mixture of financial payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1693.275s">They</a> call them hosts and guests, kind of like Airbnb. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1695.356s">It's</a> a mixture of financial payment and service. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1699.019s">So</a> they can help take out the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1701.101s">They</a> can help do a few things around the house for someone who is older and needs a little bit of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1707.826s">I</a> think this program could be really successful in Medford and it could solve a lot of our sort of interlocking problems that we have that are basically because of demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1719.411s">And</a> so that's something that again, I think would be a very big impact for a very small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1726.495s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3346.133s">Thanks</a> Um, just a super quick <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3356.541s">actually</a> make the decisions about reducing line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3360.023s">But</a> I think that when we're like we we also can't tell the mayor what to add either, you know, and and so I think this is our opportunity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3373.471s">And</a> I would just say that I <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3376.981s">I</a> think there is something to be said for us making those thoughts known in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3383.024s">And</a> I don't know, for folks who've been on this city council longer, if this forum is exactly the way to do that or if there are better ways to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3393.308s">But</a> I do hope that keep everything the same and then add all of these other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3400.371s">I</a> suspect that is less likely to get us any of those extra things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3407.014s">And,</a> you know, this is our opportunity to make these kinds of requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3410.836s">So</a> that's, that's my thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3412.477s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2003.798s">No,</a> I totally get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2005.239s">I'm</a> actually just asking about the existing buildings.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2035.426s">No,</a> I think either way is great because it is close to some of these MTA stations that are not in Medford, but are clearly affecting, we should be building there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2046.268s">I</a> was just a little bit curious, thanks.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2529.434s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2533.133s">I</a> know no one ever likes whatever colors you choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2539.018s">I</a> apologize, but I do wonder if it would be possible to make the like mixed use and commercial, you know, somehow make them like the neighborhood residential being like yellow, green and red, like all possible primary colors like <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2553.53s">is</a> a little hard for me to tell where is residential versus where is, you know, there's possibility for commercial and I don't know if there's a way to make that slightly easier to grok. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2564.953s">I</a> have to keep going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2566.653s">It</a> just doesn't make sense in my brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2569.634s">If</a> it's not too much work.<h2><a href="../2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs/2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs.html">City Council 03-11-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=238.528s">Yes,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=239.569s">We</a> had a really great meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=241.61s">We</a> invited the parents of students with disabilities to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=246.572s">We</a> discussed possibilities of how Medford can provide more activities for their children, covered many things between having it through the rec department and having it through more of a citywide effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=259.518s">And</a> I think that was the discussion and we're moving forward with trying to support those children here in Medford.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15440.183s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15440.483s">I</a> just want to express how excited I am that we are including green score in our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15445.529s">I</a> think it's going to help us meet our climate goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15448.393s">I</a> live relatively close to Vistacab and it is an absolute tree and greenness desert. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15455.3s">It</a> is an incredibly <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15457.703s">this</a> incredible heat island and deeply unpleasant to walk by. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15462.728s">And</a> I think that having this and especially the way that we have incorporated into Mystic Avenue and the way that we will be able to incorporate it into all of our zoning is just incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15475.061s">And</a> I'm very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15476.142s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16613.404s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16613.724s">I</a> have a very simple question, which is on this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16616.726s">It</a> does say that the facilities assessment is being conducted by Habib Associates, who is an approved on-call house doctor for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16625.71s">And</a> I just, I will say, found that a little bit confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16629.132s">Do</a> we have an on-call house doctor? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16631.593s">which</a> my understanding from the internet is an actual doctor, like who works for a hospital or an institution, which could be the city, and a doctor is conducting a facilities assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16641.142s">I</a> just didn't seem to, I was wondering if there's a typo.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17424.117s">I'm</a> not gonna speak on that motion, but I'll speak <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17428.439s">on</a> the more general topic of the charter?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17440.268s">It</a> is late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17441.709s">I</a> apologize to my fellow city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17443.41s">I'm</a> going to keep you up for another few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17445.171s">I</a> have been very interested in voting systems for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17448.454s">I</a> studied the mathematics of voting systems while getting my undergraduate degree in math. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17453.357s">And</a> so I think I really want to take this opportunity since I haven't <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17457.2s">previously</a> spoken very much about the charter to talk about why I am in favor of the four districts and five at large system for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17469.711s">So</a> if you look at both national and international organizations that study voting systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17475.176s">It</a> is well understood that multi seat systems are better than single seat systems and within single seat elections that first past the post is one of the worst possible electoral systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17485.947s">I'm</a> going to catch people up on what these terms mean single seat versus multi seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17491.545s">So</a> in a single-seat election, people in a localized geographic area, usually called a district or a ward, they only get to vote for one person, who usually is required to live in that ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17501.452s">And</a> only one person represents those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17503.453s">So</a> ward representation is single-seat representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17508.056s">In</a> a multi-seat election, people in a geographic area, like a city or a state, get to vote for multiple people, and multiple people represent them. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17516.261s">So</a> at-large representation is multi-seat representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17521.265s">I</a> want to talk about the terms proportional representation versus winner-take-all representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17528.491s">So</a> first, all single-seat elections are by definition winner-take-all elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17532.695s">But</a> multi-seat elections can be proportional, or they can be winner-take-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17537.519s">So</a> if you think about how the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries work, and you may not know how they work, but I'm going to tell you how they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17545.845s">In</a> the Democratic presidential primary, delegates in each state are allocated proportionally to the candidates based on the statewide vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17553.948s">So</a> if a candidate wins 40% of the vote, that candidate gets 40% of the delegates from that state. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17560.87s">It's</a> proportional. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17562.31s">In</a> most states in the Republican primary, all of a state's delegates are allocated to the candidate who receives the majority of votes in that state's primary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17573.213s">Or</a> I think it's actually the plurality of votes in that state's election. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17577.657s">So</a> if you were to get 52% of the vote in that state, you would get 100% of the delegates from that state. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17584.222s">That's</a> called winner-take-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17586.564s">And</a> the third set of terms I'm going to talk about are first-past-the-post, runoff elections, and rank-choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17594.53s">There</a> are lots of different ways to run a single-seat election. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17599.093s">But</a> these three are the only ones that really we do in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17601.815s">So</a> I'll talk about those. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17604.336s">In</a> single seat elections in America, you most often see what's called first past the post. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17609.399s">So</a> everybody votes for one, whoever gets the most votes wins, even if you have five candidates and the highest vote getter only gets 25% of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17618.424s">That</a> means the 75% of people who voted for those other four candidates don't get their preferred choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17625.808s">Now,</a> if you have a runoff election, <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17627.767s">then,</a> and you have five candidates running and one of them, the top voter gets only 25%, then there's a runoff later with the top two vote getters. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17638.549s">And</a> during that runoff, since there's only two, somebody is gonna get over 50% of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17643.31s">Ranked</a> choice voting is also called instant runoff voting because voters rank the candidates in their order of preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17651.051s">And</a> essentially you're asking the voter to tell you their <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17654.935s">took</a> their vote and their runoff vote on the same ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17658.377s">And</a> that's why it's called instant runoff voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17662.04s">And</a> so what I'm going to talk about is how groups and researchers who study these different voting systems, what they see as outcomes for these different voting systems, or at least for the one considered to get the best representation and the one considered to get the worst representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17683.015s">Multi-seat</a> proportional representation is associated with a greater likelihood that each constituent has at least one elected official who agrees with them on policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17692.782s">It</a> is not possible to gerrymander in this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17697.466s">Minority</a> representation tends to improve under proportional multi-seat systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17704.891s">They</a> tend to be more competitive with more seats in contention per district. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17712.178s">They</a> create space for more than two parties, and they lower polarization. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17717.663s">They</a> tend to have less extremism in the general population. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17721.446s">And</a> the elected officials in multi-seat proportional representation systems tend to be more likely to problem solve with people from other parties or platforms, and they tend to maintain democratic norms. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17733.047s">Winner-take-all</a> elections, which only, sorry, winner-take-all single-seat elections, have a greater likelihood that a constituent's policy beliefs are not represented by their elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17747.333s">They</a> are susceptible to gerrymandering. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17750.795s">They</a> uniquely disadvantage racial, ethnic, religious, and other political minorities, especially when they are not concentrated geographically. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17760.841s">They</a> also reduce political competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17763.929s">They</a> create safe zones by creating safe districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17769.15s">They</a> increase effective polarization, which is also called negative partisanship. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17773.594s">And</a> that means that voters from opposing parties don't just disagree with one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17778.418s">They</a> actually come to believe that people, voters from the other party are bad people. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17784.202s">And</a> I will say, I've read about this particular thing, negative partisanship, because it is an indication when you have high negative partisanship, it is an indication of a failing democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17796.712s">So</a> we are beginning to have in America high levels of this effective polarization or negative partisanship, which is not a good sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17807.465s">They</a> are <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17809.895s">They're</a> high stakes elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17812.397s">Politicians</a> are worse at problem solving. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17816.161s">They're</a> worse at maintaining democratic norms. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17818.243s">And</a> voters and politicians who lose in win or take all elections are less likely to trust democratic institutions and more likely to resort to violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17829.894s">I'll</a> just take one quote from one of the organizations that does this kind of research, the organization called Protect Democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17835.999s">It</a> says, researchers are especially concerned about the use of winner-take-all elections in highly polarized and diverse societies like the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17843.784s">As</a> one global study of democratization concluded, winner-take-all electoral systems are ill-advised for countries with deep ethnic, regional, religious, or other emotional and polarizing divisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17857.658s">So</a> if you've fallen asleep because of the wonkiness of all these terms, I'm going to tell you the conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17865.4s">So</a> this is the part to really pay attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17868.921s">Single-seat,</a> first-past-the-post elections are known, according to experts and researchers, to be among the worst possible methods for getting people appropriately represented in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17880.484s">I'm</a> going to rephrase it. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17883.604s">Single-seat</a> first-past-the-post elections, otherwise known as ward or district seats, are, according to most experts, known to be among the worst possible methods for political representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17898.047s">Okay,</a> I'm gonna guess that a lot of progressive heads are spinning around right now because this is not what you hear in progressive circles, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17905.569s">We've</a> been told that wards are better than at-large. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17908.089s">So</a> why is it that in America, research shows that ward-based is a better system at the city council level, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17918.132s">And</a> I think there are two important reasons why. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17921.893s">One</a> is the distinction between identity-based representation and policy-based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17928.294s">And</a> the other one is historical redlining. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17932.176s">So</a> in America, we have a skewed understanding of what representation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17937.72s">We</a> think that to be represented, you elect someone similar to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17941.522s">To</a> have women's issues represented, you elect a woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17943.923s">To</a> have black or LGBTQ or immigrant issues represented, you elect someone from one of those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17949.346s">If</a> you want to be represented in your city, you elect someone who lives in your ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17953.667s">This</a> is a fundamentally different understanding from what people in other countries understand to be the essence of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17960.493s">Now,</a> I believe, and people in many other countries believe, that true representation politically is when you elect someone who is going to vote the way that you want them to vote on policy, because that is the job that you are electing them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17972.641s">The</a> argument for wards is based almost entirely on an identity politics viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17979.688s">And</a> this is also why most of the time in cities across America, it is typically Democrats and progressives who want more wards, and Republicans and pro-establishment people who want more at-large representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17991.941s">Research</a> on wards looks for outcomes based upon identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17997.3s">You</a> have to understand that ward representation research also exists in the reality of American cities that have had historic redlining, meaning that we force minorities to be concentrated in certain districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18013.393s">From</a> an identity politics perspective, wards hold up pretty well in research in cities that are highly geographically segregated. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18022.264s">people</a> from these historically underrepresented identities are in fact elected more often in these cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18028.31s">There's</a> not a lot of research on whether it's true from a policy perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18032.794s">In</a> terms of policy representation, it would be good for more research to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18038.207s">But</a> it's important to note that when minorities are spread throughout the population, word representation does not even do a good job of bringing in different identities. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18048.535s">And</a> in fact, it has shown to be the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18051.397s">Multi-seat</a> representation does a better job of electing representatives from minority communities than single-seat districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18058.442s">So</a> I think that's something that's important to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18064.59s">I</a> think I will go ahead and stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18067.732s">Those</a> are my main reasons why I'm very happy with the idea that we are going to have a nice even mix of award representation and at-large representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18079.159s">I</a> wrote a blog article for people who want more detail and who want to understand a little bit better and have some insight into what I actually have spent a lot of my time as my day job doing for the last eight years in terms of reinvigorating democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18092.47s">I'm</a> not going to bore you with that here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18093.871s">It's</a> late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18094.491s">It's,</a> in fact, not even late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18095.792s">It's</a> early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18097.674s">But</a> you can see my blog for those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18101.136s">I</a> wanted to say a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18103.498s">A</a> final point, one is just that most cities in Massachusetts have larger wards than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18110.524s">And</a> there are many cities, I believe Somerville and Lowell are among them, that have wards that are twice our size, which basically means they are wards that are equal to the size of the district in the current city council proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18121.894s">The</a> other thing I want to say is I find it quite frustrating that the dialogue in the city council meetings has turned into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18129.618s">If</a> you're for eight wards and three at large, then you are a good and righteous and virtuous person. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18134.201s">But</a> if you vote for four districts and five at large, then you're an evil, power-hungry, and dishonest person. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18140.305s">And</a> I want to mark this as that rhetoric <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18145.188s">is</a> exactly the kind of polarization that we have come to in America, because we don't have very good electoral systems, and we have this, you know, effective political of a negative partisanship problem, right, this is what these things lead to. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18161.201s">I</a> am hoping that we can all try to <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18164.384s">to</a> understand that we don't need to accuse others of being evil and bad, and hopefully also understand that the difference between—these are both hybrid systems—the difference between 8 and 3 and 4 and 5 is not a gigantic difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18179.631s">I</a> personally think that 4 and 5 is in fact better representation for all the reasons that I said, and I would love it if we can, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18187.659s">try</a> and tone down a little bit the rhetoric that paints people as being bad people. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18194.203s">So</a> that's what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18195.584s">Thanks</a> so much.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1027.805s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2079.022s">Hey</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2079.922s">So</a> thanks so much for all the work that you've done and all the folks you've talked to and everything that's, you know, I know there's a lot going into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2087.326s">I</a> had a question as I'm looking over the roles, powers and duties, and please tell me if I'm misreading this, but it does look like <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2097.373s">The,</a> the four essential roles are all related to Medford specifically and I just know from some of the folks I've talked to that they felt that their hands were tied and they were told they were not allowed to discuss human rights, anywhere outside the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2114.515s">So</a> I just, I wanted to raise that and see what you think as the person working on this document, if you've had those kinds of discussions, you know, maybe I'm wrong and that's, you know, that's not what this does. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2126.241s">So</a> I would just love to get your feedback on that, just Councilor Tang.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2192.636s">I</a> was actually just thinking, instead of deleting the words in Medford, I think it is appropriate that it be about Medford, but I think maybe there could be a, you know, letter E or something that is, you know, sort of, I don't know how to phrase this, but like an outlet for discussion of, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2215.07s">human</a> rights issues that affect the people of Medford, even if those issues are not occurring in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2222.017s">Because</a> there are, you know, I mean, look, just thinking about the, you know, the great desire here in Medford for a ceasefire earlier last year, that there were many families here who were directly <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2236.113s">affected,</a> directly affected by what was happening abroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2240.217s">So</a> I think at least the ability for them to discuss those things and to be a place where people in Medford can go to raise issues of human rights that are affecting them personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2254.129s">I</a> don't know how to phrase it, but I think having that as, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2258.995s">one</a> thing that they are explicitly allowed to discuss, I think might be a benefit, but I'm open to people's opinions as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2289.162s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2291.983s">And</a> I did have one other question if I may, and that's about the question of whether the city solicitor is the council or the commission has access to other council. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2305.366s">I</a> mean, I'm inclined without hearing more about it, I'm sort of inclined to, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2314.622s">say</a> that it probably should be the city solicitor or the council of the city because they are a commission of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2322.186s">But</a> I would be interested in understanding a little bit more at least of how that would be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2326.828s">I</a> mean, anyone can go and find another lawyer that they happen to know or get some advice from somebody else, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2334.452s">But</a> if we're talking about it being like paid legal counsel, I would wanna have some idea of where that funding is coming from.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2553.024s">Would</a> you mind telling me where that is? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2554.204s">I'm</a> looking for it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2568.072s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2714.965s">Thanks,</a> I just wanted to chime in and thank Faringer. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2718.547s">I</a> read that whole part and I believe that you're quite correct that that we're already covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2724.191s">So</a> Councilor Tseng, no need to add anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2728.133s">I</a> think that language covers, thank you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4790.376s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I feel similarly. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4792.458s">I</a> suspect that if we do strike that first sentence, then the mayor will have an opinion and, you know, we can like strike it as a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4801.866s">But</a> if the mayor comes back, I'm not concerned that this will ever be used to say that they cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4810.554s">use</a> some other legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4811.794s">I</a> think the fact that we have discussed it here and that we are saying it is our intention that that second sentence means that they are allowed to seek other counsel, I think is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4824.898s">So</a> I'm not, I'm not concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4826.498s">And</a> I think either way is probably fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4828.539s">And</a> even if we send it to the mayor with only one sentence, only the second sentence, she may send it back with the first one added. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4833.84s">So,</a> which I think would also be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4836.941s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4884.773s">Sorry,</a> no, that was that was not intentional.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5058.84s">Would</a> you mind rereading the motion back? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5060.76s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5363.53s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5364.691s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to give my own little bit of report back on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5368.093s">I</a> think my take on it was slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5372.175s">I</a> did, you know, the first interaction I had with someone after the official hour was over was someone who said that she felt that the whole tone was very angry and that she, you know, felt uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5386.364s">And</a> so, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5389.473s">being</a> a person who has done other listening sessions, you know, with other groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5394.417s">I</a> know we have all done some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5396.098s">But</a> my hope is that for the next one that I attend, I will be more facilitating. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5403.503s">I</a> will come with, you know, some visuals on topics that can be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5411.208s">I</a> do think that when one or two <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5413.53s">people</a> dominate the conversation with angry rhetoric, it makes it very difficult for other people to discuss the things that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5423.113s">And</a> I felt that the conversation that started the second the hour was over were actually conversations that were not pet projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5432.296s">These</a> were the real <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5434.117s">things</a> that people are concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5435.978s">I</a> heard people talk about their need for housing as a senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5439.54s">The</a> things that I heard over and over and over at the doors that to me are the primary issues that did not get discussed during that hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5449.924s">It</a> was things like the lack of transportation for elderly people, that there used to be something called Megan Transport, and there used to be other ways that they could get around the city, but those things are not there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5460.169s">So</a> they, you know, were wondering what we can do about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5463.711s">And</a> then some talked about housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5465.913s">And,</a> you know, as I mentioned, some of the things that I'm working on, the home sharing, bringing home sharing, matching service to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5475.839s">And</a> I talked about co-housing, and I talked about, you know, other <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5480.303s">Like</a> the RFP and how the hope is that that will have a lot of smaller units that older people can move into because they talked about wanting to downsize. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5488.993s">So</a> these were the conversations that I think are the, the more <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5496.446s">general</a> ones that many, many seniors want to talk about, and the ones that we ended up talking about for an hour were more the pet projects of like, my street has a pothole in this one place, and I want to know about that pothole, or I want to continue talking about Salem Street, when we already have public forums for talking about the Salem Street zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5517.58s">That</a> should be something, it's fine if somebody wants to bring it up and talk about it for three minutes, but that shouldn't dominate the conversation at these listening sessions because it prevents us from hearing from the nine-tenths of people who are in attendance who aren't there for that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5534.457s">We</a> already have forums for talking about that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5537.2s">My</a> plan is that I will be facilitating more, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5542.164s">And</a> then I did take some of these issues and following up with city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5548.77s">I</a> talked to the economic development director and talking about the RFP, talking about parking near the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5559.198s">I'll</a> be following up with the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5561.82s">I</a> followed up with DPW as well with some more general questions about when do they have <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5570.488s">plans</a> that they post on the website, like the engineering department actually posted last year, two different plans, like a crack ceiling plan and I believe like a pothole filling plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5580.714s">And</a> just when were we gonna be able to see those? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5583.775s">Because</a> people do wanna know when these things are going, like which streets are gonna be done next. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5589.678s">And</a> so I was kind of looking for a timeline for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5592.86s">And</a> just generally following up with city staff on some of the specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5599.104s">that</a> were coming up during that session. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5601.846s">So</a> I do think it was a good session, but I think that we can do better in terms of our ability to make sure that residents who are showing up at these feel comfortable, that they don't feel like it's <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5614.515s">Like</a> they are shut out by a small group that has a particular agenda, but that we are actively asking questions about the things we have an idea that, you know, seniors care about or <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5629.946s">any</a> listening session that it might be, whether it's like parents or folks at West Medford Community Center, or no matter who it is, we might have some facilitated questions where we are asking people, hey, we'd love to know your opinion about, you know, housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5644.269s">Like,</a> how is housing going? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5645.069s">We</a> want to know your opinion about transportation around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5646.79s">We</a> want to know your opinion, you know, about, like, how is this affecting you in your life? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5651.311s">So,</a> thank you so much for letting me give a little bit of a longer report back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5656.867s">I'm</a> excited that we're doing these. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5658.468s">And</a> I think the more of them we do, the better we'll get. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5662.089s">And</a> I'm really excited to make them places where residents feel comfortable and welcomed and that they are, their input is, you know, that they can also give input. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5672.452s">And</a> we have kind of a step up, step back, understanding that these are for everyone to contribute equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5679.874s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5680.835s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6002.539s">Hey,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6003.58s">I</a> am going to yes and. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6006.141s">I'm</a> excited about what Councilor Lazzaro was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6010.043s">And</a> as often happens with me, I didn't mention that, yes, of course, we also will listen to concerns that people come with. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6021.068s">I</a> think maybe we either have the first half or the second half of the listening session dedicated to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6028.552s">so</a> that there's a specific time that is like, hey, we're going to ask you questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6033.695s">And</a> then there's a time that's like, hey, you ask us questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6037.918s">But</a> I think it's rare that elected officials do the part that I'm talking about, where they're actively asking people, hey, I actually want to know how housing is affecting your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6055.138s">And</a> that's a piece that I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6058.42s">So</a> I would love to have that piece added to what I think what we have been doing, which is more of an office hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6065.002s">Office</a> hours is like anybody can show up and they ask you whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6069.744s">But</a> I think the listening session part <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6072.265s">which</a> to me is like finding out from like asking targeted questions and hoping that everyone there can talk about their own experience to give you a picture of how our policies are affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6085.84s">That</a> is a part that I would love to add as a yes and thanks.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6546.149s">I</a> mean, it's coverage both both sides, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6548.65s">So</a> it covers the city side and then also the resident side of of the pipes that they determine are lead, which is probably far fewer than we think.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6604.484s">Yeah,</a> neither. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6605.024s">It's</a> the city is going to do all the work.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6607.666s">And</a> the city pays for it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6843.252s">I</a> actually really appreciated that it was formatted properly because it made it look so much more professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6848.515s">I</a> did read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6849.816s">I</a> actually thought it was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6850.957s">So</a> I'm good on the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6853.618s">I</a> will happily vote in favor.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6968.37s">Which</a> might I add was the thing that I proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6975.09s">dearly</a> similar to the things I proposed.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6988.418s">They</a> were super mad until someone on the other side proposed it and then they loved it, exactly as I said in that council meeting.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6996.282s">You</a> remember I was like, I was like,
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6999.952s">Never</a> mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7001.233s">I</a> said what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7001.893s">And</a> now I said it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7172.796s">I</a> move to approve with edits.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3574.53s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3575.191s">Yeah,</a> I just want to give my kind of perspective on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3580.973s">First</a> of all, if this were coming into <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3585.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3592.083s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3593.544s">So</a> if this were coming into, because I was not on the governance committee, if this were coming into this body, whether it was eight and three or five and four, four and five, I guess, either way, I would vote in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3606.971s">I</a> believe that we want a combination of more localized members as well as at-large members. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3616.716s">I</a> think that is what I am for. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3620.151s">So</a> either way, whichever of those it was, I would be voting in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3625.055s">I</a> think it is also fair to say that the survey that the study committee did included a question about combination of wards and at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3641.23s">It</a> did not ever ask <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3643.927s">whether</a> that should be four districts or eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3649.159s">A</a> little odd because they are recommending four <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3653.401s">for</a> school committee and eight for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3656.183s">It</a> seems like maybe you include that in your survey so that you can get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3663.27s">I</a> personally don't believe that we have any idea how many people in Medford would prefer the eight wards versus how many people in Medford would prefer four districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3673.119s">I</a> think I can look at the numbers right now, people who want a combination of wards and at large, and you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3682.498s">I</a> get it that ward in Medford means a very specific thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3686.339s">I</a> think our wards in Medford are quite small compared to a lot of the other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3691.701s">So</a> combination of some sort of localized and at large is 60% of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3696.263s">I</a> think that is what we are voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3700.904s">To</a> stay as is, meaning all at large, 18% of people think we should stay all at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3706.466s">17%</a> of people think we should be all wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3713.749s">you</a> have approximately the same number of people who think it should stay like 20%, 20% almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3718.591s">It's</a> like 18%, 17% say that it should be all at large, 17% say it should be all ward, and 60% say it should be a combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3727.514s">I</a> think there's a decent argument to say that something that is near half and half is maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3738.327s">something</a> that people in Medford want. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3741.268s">It's</a> unfortunate that we really have no idea whether the community would prefer eight or four, because that was never asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3750.19s">So</a> I just want to push back a little bit on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3752.271s">We</a> know absolutely certainly that everyone in Medford wants eight words. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3756.312s">I</a> don't think that that question was ever asked or answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3760.893s">And,</a> uh, yeah, like I said, I would be in favor of mixed whether it was eight or four. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3766.98s">Um,</a> I think going to a slightly larger council is good too. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3769.923s">Um,</a> so that's just my position.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4722.432s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4722.832s">I</a> actually wanted to bring up a totally different topic, the topic of ranked choice voting for single seat elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4731.119s">So</a> that would be any districts or wards as well as the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4736.484s">And</a> I apologize that I did not attend the final <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4742.844s">and</a> I don't know whether this was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4746.645s">I</a> was not on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4747.726s">I</a> did try to attend the other two meetings, but I would love to raise the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4753.749s">Um,</a> and here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4755.97s">From</a> folks about the topic of ranked choice voting.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6751.841s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11857.347s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11857.667s">So</a> I have downloaded from the state of Massachusetts, a database that includes the sizes of all wards and precincts of every city and town in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11871.275s">And</a> I will say it looks like most cities, and of course we're only looking at cities because towns have a totally different government structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11881.901s">So</a> we're only looking at cities.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11892.167s">Well,</a> this database includes all towns and cities.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11894.789s">All</a> municipalities in all of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11903.986s">sadly,</a> this particular database, I wish I'd done this before, because I would have marked them as cities or towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11907.967s">So</a> this particular database does not in fact tell me which ones are cities, which ones are towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11913.848s">But</a> as I am looking through it, I've gone up through letter N, and I have not yet found any cities that have wards <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11930.59s">as</a> small as our wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11932.37s">So</a> far, everything looks about twice as large, one and a half times as large, three times as large in terms of population, just the population. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11943.833s">So,</a> I mean, look at Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11945.633s">And</a> some of these are considerably smaller cities than we are in population. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11950.834s">I</a> thought that really matters, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11952.675s">But</a> it looks like Chelsea's are <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11959.184s">twice</a> the size of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11964.048s">Chicopee</a> actually would be similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11971.155s">Everett,</a> we're looking one and a half times, not quite one and a half times. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11980.983s">Somerville</a> are twice the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11983.566s">Fall</a> River. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11987.476s">more</a> than one and a half times. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11991.499s">I'm</a> just looking, I understand that people want local representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11997.302s">And</a> I understand that we are unusual in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12001.525s">And</a> I made the argument last time that in other states, we are not at all unusual in terms of the representation that we have, either the current representation that we have in terms of being at large, because all over the country, that still is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12018.148s">But</a> I think the point I'm trying to make is the argument that we should definitely be wards, because that is just like all the other Massachusetts cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12032.475s">And</a> again, I would love to dig a little bit more into this database. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12035.676s">So</a> I'm not sort of trying to understand at a glance, like, am I making sure we're looking at, I think all of those I mentioned are cities and not towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12045.902s">And</a> I would want to double check that those are in fact the ones that are, that the size of the wards are as listed, the things that are listed as wards, though they each have like a person per ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12061.415s">But</a> it does look like our wards are smaller than most cities wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12067.74s">So</a> I just want to make that point.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12222.637s">I</a> apologize, I gotta correct myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12223.957s">Chicopee</a> would be smaller.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12226.618s">And</a> I haven't dug deeply into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12228.879s">So</a> this is really just kind of trying to get a sense.<h2><a href="../2025-02-26_ZG6Mf3yqBkQ/2025-02-26_ZG6Mf3yqBkQ.html">City Council Education and Culture Committee 02-25-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1413.781s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1414.822s">So,</a> I appreciate so much that you're here again, I was there at the library with you and I was with, you know, with one of your very first meetings with Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1423.549s">I,</a> I really have heard from you guys very clearly that this is not about just rec programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1430.995s">I</a> loved the way that you phrased it about it including restaurants and places of worship and meetings and events, live entertainment, holidays, employment, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1440.719s">There's</a> so many things that we could be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1444.2s">My</a> volunteer team has found a volunteer who is a specialist in special ed, both in her work and in her education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1452.803s">And</a> what I'm hoping we can do is set up a meeting where <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1460.224s">the</a> group and this volunteer and I can all meet together because I believe that she has volunteered to do 20 to 40 hours over the next few months, and budget season is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1474.551s">So</a> if she can pull on all these threads and find out and do the legwork that the mayor is gonna want to hear, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1483.375s">about</a> what this is actually going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1487.66s">She</a> can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1488.641s">She</a> wants to volunteer to do that, then we'll be able to have something that is much more concrete for the mayor to approve of in budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1497.751s">So</a> this is where I think this volunteer is going to be really incredibly helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1503.157s">is</a> to hear all of the ways, all of the ideas that you guys have and the ways that Medford could be like this, you know, the inclusion specialist that you want to be housed somewhere in the city, the ways that that person could bring these kinds of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1520.555s">And</a> that way, she can do the legwork <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1523.077s">to</a> ensure that the mayor feels comfortable with funding this position and also where in the budget and where this person should be housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1532.62s">I</a> think having that volunteer do that legwork before budget season is the way that we're gonna be able to have this placed in the best place that you guys feel comfortable with it being funded in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1554.518s">Well,</a> I think my suggestion has been that we meet with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1560.103s">Well,</a> I would love to see her here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1563.085s">I</a> don't know if she's coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1565.287s">I</a> think we need to have like a deeper, like her hearing this meeting would be great, but having a deeper discussion where she can really dig in and ask tons of questions to you guys, that's going to be a lot deeper than this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1577.717s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1583.851s">But</a> let's set up a meeting where I can be there, she can be there, we can make sure that we get this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1588.873s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-02-25_Ve1E4R1vH68/2025-02-25_Ve1E4R1vH68.html">City Council 02-25-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3454.158s">Is</a> it safe to say that like, this is just the very end of like the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3459.822s">roots</a> or tree branches or whatever you want to call it, of the water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3462.924s">So</a> at this point, because of the deadline and the funding, we're going to be working at the ends of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3470.368s">And</a> that after that, when that deadline is no longer pressing, that we will move on to working to the rest of the aging water system.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3833.241s">Thanks,</a> just one super quick question, and I think you already said it, but if you can repeat, when would this work be completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3841.326s">Approximately,</a> do we have any ideas?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.106s">Can</a> I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.867s">So</a> I'm specifically thinking of some constituents who have reached out to me and like begged me for any sort of resources that they can do that they can possibly get for replacing their lines because they know they have lead in their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3886.265s">Do</a> you have any thoughts on should they just pay to do it themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3891.228s">If</a> they replace their part, but then the other part isn't replaced, is that then possibly going to be worse? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3897.692s">What</a> should they do, given that they're concerned right now?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4002.861s">It's</a> so incredibly helpful.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4143.423s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're not like allowing ADUs in all the single family places. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4147.264s">But</a> if there happens to be a single family home in a, you know, zoned something that's not single family, that they're not then not allowed to do the same thing all the other single families are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4155.246s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5639.473s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5641.214s">So</a> I so appreciate you looking into this and especially into where they these small commercial districts already exist in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5650.878s">I</a> will say as we have gone through this whole zoning process, I think the thing I am most excited about is what I have been calling <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5659.121s">community</a> mixed use, which I think is exactly what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5662.783s">The</a> idea, and I phrased it as, you know, within a half mile of every home, having a corner where people can go and there would be a space that was co-working by day, community events by night, there would be a cafe, there could be a bookstore, you know, a small grocery. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5683.535s">So</a> all of these things, and I love the reframing that I <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5688.337s">a</a> five minute walk to an ice cream shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5691.341s">Everyone</a> should be five minutes from ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5693.063s">So</a> these things I think to me are what I'm the most excited is to really bring walkability and the neighborhood feeling and the idea that you're going to get to know your neighbors in this specific place that really is designed for you to meet the people who live <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5709.901s">on</a> your block, two blocks over near you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5714.464s">And</a> in part, what I am really hoping for is as I talk to people who have lived in Medford for a very long time, one of the things that they don't like about the changes that are happening is that they have known their neighbors their whole lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5732.396s">And</a> they really feel this break with the people who are new here who aren't getting to know their neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5739.24s">That</a> that is, is troublesome and, and I personally agree as someone who has moved often. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5746.366s">I</a> wish that I knew my neighbors better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5748.608s">I</a> wish there was somewhere that I could go I mean for me it's Colette bakery, because, you know, we pass it every day that we go to school and so we stop in and we know people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5757.415s">But</a> I think everyone should have a place, whether they have lived here for 50 years, or whether they just moved here, they should be able to walk somewhere that they will have an opportunity to get to know their neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5770.88s">So</a> this is very exciting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5773.061s">And</a> among the uses, I would love for us to consider children's and teens activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5780.024s">Because</a> I think that is also something that I hear often from residents is that we don't have enough activities for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5787.649s">And</a> if there were something that were walkable, especially teenagers, that's like a great opportunity to have something where teenagers can go and hang out, it's a safe space. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5800.517s">where</a> they're a few blocks from home, they're very close by, and yet it's also designed for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5806.021s">So</a> those are the kinds of considerations that I'm thinking of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5809.123s">And</a> I'm hoping, I apologize if this was already sent out, but I got the full color maps of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5817.75s">the</a> proposed zoning and the existing use, but I didn't get the map of this one that has these existing commercial spots in the neighborhoods, and I would love to have that if that's possible.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6416.588s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6417.288s">And</a> I did want to just respond quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6419.29s">I</a> think the reason why this is one of the more major changes that is happening in the residential zoning is this very specific spot, because it was single family too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6430.46s">And</a> now we are changing it to <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6433.467s">urban</a> residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6435.208s">And</a> the reason is because there's a brand new T stop that, you know, 10 years ago, did we even know 10 years ago that it was going to come to there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6444.03s">Maybe</a> around 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6445.83s">We</a> hoped. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6446.47s">But</a> the zoning is 37 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6449.471s">So</a> like 37 years ago when this zoning was written, that T stop was not even a twinkling in the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6457.153s">of</a> the person who ended up planning the T stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6460.455s">So</a> this is why this particular neighborhood is seeing such a change is because it really is right where that T stop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6468.039s">And</a> the whole rest of the city is going to see much less change. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6471.862s">So</a> I do understand that this, you know, for folks who live in this neighborhood, you know, we may want to have more discussions and really talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6480.407s">And</a> this is also why I was, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6482.988s">wanted</a> to deeply ask these questions about like I want to make sure that single family homes, people who only have single family homes in this particular neighborhood are able to do with their homes, what every other single family homeowner can do in Medford, that I think is very important that they be able to do, you know, an ad you that they be able to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6505.332s">put</a> on a porch or whatever it is that they want to do to their single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6509.053s">I</a> do not want people to, I think we already have too much turnover in this city, you know, because of the skyrocketing housing prices and the pressure on people to, you know, sell and move somewhere cheaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6522.999s">I</a> want to make sure that the folks who currently live here is the people that we're serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6527.9s">But</a> this is this one neighborhood is going to be the spot <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6532.002s">that</a> looks like in the zoning in terms of the residential neighborhoods does get the most change, and it is purely because of that T-stop.<h2><a href="../2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM/2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM.html">City Council 02-11-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2544.697s">For</a> the amendment, can we send it to the mayor first? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2551.517s">Wait,</a> give the mayor a heads up before we send it to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2554.182s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2556.166s">My</a> assumption was that it was going to go to the mayor first. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2560.215s">Can</a> I jump in?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2584.02s">Thank</a> you, I appreciate that.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=7.698s">Make</a> sure you go to ours.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1960.67s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1961.971s">I,</a> myself, am very excited that we're going to have some meetings about zoning that are not in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1967.695s">Going</a> out, you know, where the people are, places that people feel more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1972.618s">I</a> think that's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1973.919s">I</a> get that we are under-resourced, but I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's push for us to really do more and to do our best effort to get <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1988.069s">all</a> this information out to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1991.59s">And</a> that being said, I do want to make a comment that we have been, am I correct, 37 years without zoning changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2002.993s">Over</a> 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2004.693s">I</a> think it's closer to 40, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2007.214s">Close</a> to 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2011.492s">Not</a> deciding to not change anything is a decision, and the world changes and the demographics of our city changes and coven happens and you know things happen in the world the.com bust in the 2000s happened and, you know, things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2026.88s">change</a> in the world and in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2029.542s">And</a> the choice for the city council to not change the zoning is a choice, as much as a change is a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2037.107s">I</a> personally have talked to many people who, you know, have been wanting a lot of the changes, zoning and legislative that we have, you know, on our governing agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2047.983s">have</a> said to me, I've lived here for 30 years and I have wanted these things to happen for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2052.987s">I</a> thought they would never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2054.688s">I'm</a> so excited that finally some of these things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2058.55s">So</a> I think, you know, it's just important to remember that while change is hard, the whole world changes and zoning needs to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2068.037s">A</a> lot of the zoning things that we are doing is bringing things to <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2072.44s">the</a> current non-conforming structures that exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2076.321s">So</a> in many places, we're not, you know, yes, we are changing many things, but there are places where we're simply trying to reflect what actually currently exists because what's built there is not conforming to this old zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2090.763s">And</a> on that note, I did have just one small request that in some of our educational materials, I don't know whether it be the videos or just <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2100.865s">you</a> know, infographics that we create or in the writing or whatever that might be, I think it's important for people to be able to see very simply what the old zoning said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2112.24s">what</a> currently exists and is non-conforming, and what the new zoning says. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2118.123s">And</a> if people are especially concerned about heights and about density. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2122.426s">So</a> in very simple, as much as we can have incredibly simple ways of describing, here's the old zoning, here's the new zoning, and here's what is currently built, and why you can see that in these places, we're actually not changing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2136.994s">We're</a> literally, we're changing the zoning, but we're only making it meet what exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2140.616s">and</a> in these other places where we are changing the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2144.038s">I</a> think those, you know, as much as we can simplify it for people, that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2149.142s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4561.79s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4563.271s">So</a> I know that in the first proposal, then it was amended by President Bears, and I just wanted to kind of note that in the amended, sorry, in the proposal two, there are, interestingly, there is a part of the northern part of West Medford that even in the before amended proposal one, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4588.103s">was</a> Neighborhood Residential 1, which was nothing but single-unit dwelling plus ADU and historic conversion, amended to be a larger portion that was only gonna be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4602.712s">And</a> now in Proposal 2, it's actually Neighborhood Residential 2, and so it allows two units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4608.075s">So</a> I think that portion, and when I look at the reality, there are no two-unit dwellings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4614.219s">So</a> I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4616.04s">I</a> just want us to be careful that places, and I think this was the intention, President Bears, of the proposal that you made, which I was supportive of, please correct me if I'm wrong, but that in single-family areas that were single-family that are in fact single-family, there are no two units currently built there, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4642.084s">That</a> I think I certainly felt that adding a to use and historic conversion was the right amount of change for those areas and I believe there are two areas, one is the northern part of North Medford and the other one is a triangle in Lawrence estates, but that both of those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4660.279s">And</a> I would be totally like every resident there is like, yeah, let's have two fellows here but my guess is that that's probably not going to be the reaction that we get. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4669.456s">So,</a> that would be my. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4672.981s">inclination.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4674.282s">And</a> I don't know if other councillors would be supportive of that, but I think that was kind of what President Bears's amendment was going towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4683.227s">So</a> I wonder if we could, you know, come to some sort of agreement on whether we think that that's a good idea to roll it back, especially the northern west Medford part, roll it back to neighborhood residential planning.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4703.077s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4703.838s">So</a> if you look at the difference between the proposed neighborhood residential districts version 1 and the amended proposal 1, and I believe that is President Bearsar's amendment, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4720.227s">in</a> both of those, the very northern part of West Medford, that thing that goes way up by the lakes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4729.352s">In</a> both of those, it is neighborhood residential one, both in the original and also in the amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4736.495s">And</a> if you now look at proposal two, that I believe is neighborhood residential two.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4861.622s">I</a> mean, I could make a motion, but I don't know if a motion is really necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4865.304s">I</a> feel like if there's some consensus on this committee, then we can trust our Innocence Associates planners to do a slight revision.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5032.127s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5032.687s">Can</a> I make a suggestion then that if a councilor wants to propose something that maybe we say, are there any objections to, then we don't have to vote or anything and people don't have to every single person chime in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5043.293s">It's</a> a little bit simpler. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5045.974s">And</a> I will make the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5047.375s">I</a> will say, are there any objections to the very northernmost part of West Bedford as it goes up Grove Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5058.493s">Somewhere</a> in there, there being a boundary between Neighborhood Residential 1 and Neighborhood Residential 2, currently it's all Neighborhood Residential 2, let the furthest north part be Residential 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5071.429s">And</a> I think we can kind of look at the original proposal before the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5077.525s">that</a> that may be a good place to look at for the differential between one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5082.889s">Any</a> objections to them making a change like that?<h2><a href="../2025-01-28_Z5S9vVqtj_w/2025-01-28_Z5S9vVqtj_w.html">City Council 01-28-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=820.844s">Oh,</a> I found them in order pending, tiny, tiny corrections that I sent to the clerk.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=930.723s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=931.023s">At</a> the Public Works Committee, we had Commissioner Tim McGivern and our engineer Omar Tella to give us an update on the roads, both their conditions, as well as how they are going to be spending the new $500,000 per year from the overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=947.989s">And</a> we also discussed the potential of having volunteer residents helping to plant city trees.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2251.932s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2252.713s">Um,</a> I do want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing forward a number of ideas that I think are really pertinent to what's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2260.48s">I</a> know it's quite difficult to get information out to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2265.305s">And,</a> you know, I do hope that we can do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2271.07s">of</a> informing people on a topic that is as important as these overrides and the way that it's going to affect their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2280.732s">There</a> are a number of things in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2281.773s">I</a> just wanna state where I am on these various different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2285.734s">The</a> listening and education sessions, I think are fantastic idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2288.614s">I'm</a> always a fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2289.575s">I</a> would love to be at them and help as much as I am able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2293.235s">I</a> believe as I think Vice President Collins <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2300.277s">mentioned</a> that we have maxed out our ability to the statewide exemptions for our seniors, veterans, disabled, and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2311.919s">I</a> believe that we are already at the max, but I think asking our state representatives what else, what more we can do is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2320.46s">I'm</a> personally in favor of the homeowner exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2323.321s">I</a> know that not everyone on the council is, or at least I don't want to guarantee that everyone on the council is, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2329.862s">I</a> think looking into that and beginning that discussion now so that we are in time to be able to make that decision later in the year is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2340.047s">Absolutely</a> getting information about the abatement process as quickly as possible in every means possible would be fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2348.972s">Any</a> grants and fees that can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2351.454s">You</a> know, I certainly am in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2354.337s">So,</a> that is where I said I am in favor of both this proposal as well as the proposal so I will vote for both.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5142.353s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5143.473s">In</a> addition to amending this, I assume it's what you're suggesting that we amended to send it to a governance committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5152.057s">I</a> wonder if we could also do a friendly amendment to just add in language saying we urge our fellow councilors to not place other items of discussion before these hearings from business leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5169.145s">Business</a> people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5172.042s">because</a> a lot of the problem it sounds like is that we just, you know, we take things out of order and then we end up accidentally pushing these things until 11 o'clock at night when really let's not do that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5705.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5708.797s">I</a> absolutely so appreciated our former messenger, Lera Lepore, who's a wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5717.904s">I</a> do hope that we can update the messenger role a little bit given <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5724.62s">know,</a> the digital age and that we may not need the exact services that were in his job description before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5731.507s">I</a> will say that if the city is going to hire a staff person for the city council, if the city council has a staff person, I would hope that some of their time might be dedicated to constituent services, which I think in, you know, most cities that is one of the first staff that is hired for a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5750.485s">in,</a> you know, there are certain cities, Cambridge and other cities, where every city councilor has a staff person who basically does constituent services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5757.591s">I</a> think constituent services are incredibly important to the number of emails that we receive with people who have questions, you know, that really are questions for the administration of us, you know, sending them to the right administrative person in the, you know, in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5773.505s">And</a> I'm hoping that either <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5777.408s">the</a> messenger position can be one that can do a little bit of that kind of work and less driving around to deliver us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5788.415s">As</a> much as I enjoyed having the paper copies of the agendas delivered to my door, I hope that maybe some of that time can be used for constituent services and that we can just kind of look at that role and update it for the 21st century. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5801.604s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6638.71s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6639.451s">First,</a> I want to thank you for all of the meetings that you attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6642.733s">You're</a> one of our most engaged residents here in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6645.956s">And</a> the fact that you happen not to be at that meeting is completely understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6651.0s">And</a> I'm glad that you're here asking this question, because most residents don't, in fact, go and look back at the committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6657.905s">But</a> they may, in fact, come and look at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6662.069s">And</a> you asked some questions that I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6664.05s">So</a> I specifically asked Commissioner McIvern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6665.932s">I'm</a> sorry, I can go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6666.832s">No,</a> no, not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6668.033s">Again,</a> I think it's important that we do discuss these things here at the official regular City Council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6673.555s">I</a> did ask about resurfacing because I know with roads, you can save a lot of money by doing that kind of repair in between, and so I asked if maybe we would be able to save money in the future by doing these kinds of intermediary repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6685.92s">He</a> said, as President Bears noted, that unfortunately, because of the nature of <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6692.682s">playing</a> tennis, that it might affect the way the ball bounces that might cause people to sprain ankles, that doing those kinds of repairs doesn't actually work on the kind of surface also as noted that the underlying, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6709.173s">structure</a> just needs to be repaired at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6712.195s">And</a> then importantly, I think also Councilor Scarpelli noted, if I may, to let me know if I'm wrong, that the high school uses this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6722.264s">Like</a> it is a very used tennis courts that really, Medford really would suffer if we did without. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6729.71s">And</a> so I appreciate your question.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8137.658s">I'm</a> sorry, I don't have a memorized who's microphone or who's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8145.964s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8146.805s">So</a> as a general rule, I'm often hesitant for the city to sell off its owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8155.351s">And</a> this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8158.593s">I</a> have quite a few questions about, we have a newly formed affordable housing trust, it is looking into community land trusts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8167.002s">It</a> seems like city properties where housing can be built are perfect candidates for community land trust, you know, land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8176.071s">I</a> am like the language in this seems vaguely to point toward the funding probably being used for portable housing but not necessarily it says for general municipal purposes and or for the purpose of disposition on such terms and conditions as in the best interest of the city like these to me <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8199.143s">what</a> we are doing is handing over to the mayor the ability to sell a city property with no conditions, and I am not comfortable with that, with the way that this is worded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8208.266s">So</a> I would have a lot of questions about how the Affordable Housing Trust fits into this, why there is a rush when the Affordable Housing Trust is probably not really prepared to deal with land right now because they're in the early stages, and we don't yet have a community land trust, why we are now suddenly desperately selling something that has not been used since 1950, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8229.171s">So</a> I have quite a few questions, and I don't believe I will be prepared to vote in favor of this tonight.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8736.187s">Um,</a> just a hypothetical question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8739.649s">Looking</a> down the line, if, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8742.933s">this</a> land were not to be sold and were to be, is it possible for the city to transfer ownership of this land to the Affordable Housing Trust or to a community land trust, should we have one?<h2><a href="../2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw/2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw.html">City Council Governance Committee 01-22-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1841.181s">Thank</a> you, and I so appreciate the, first of all, the work from the commission and also the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1848.606s">I</a> am not a member of this committee, so thank you so much for allowing me to ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1855.49s">This</a> is on the same exact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1857.191s">I</a> know that, for example, when we were working to try and reduce the rodent population, that the person sponsoring a piece of legislation <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1868.43s">was</a> communicating with the staff in order to understand best how we can help the staff through the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1874.971s">The</a> staff needed an ordinance to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1876.932s">And</a> so working together with staff to understand how we can best tailor the ordinance to meet the needs of the staff, that to me, like, I'm 100% in favor of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1891.825s">nor</a> shall any member of the city council give orders or direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1894.967s">Absolutely,</a> I 100% agree.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1899.229s">It</a> just says, you know, the city council shall contact only solely through the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1904.072s">And</a> it seems like getting information on how to craft ordinances to best meet the needs of staff, that's, I just wanna make sure, again, we're all asking about this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1918.259s">That</a> would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1919.399s">I</a> just specifically, I mean, I wasn't the sponsor of rodent control, but I know how much, you know, that was something staff needed and that the sponsor of that ordinance needed to just hear from and worked with staff members to craft it carefully so that it met the needs of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1936.866s">So</a> those kinds of things I think are important that we are able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1941.967s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.165s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.525s">I</a> just had one quick question, which I think Councilor Bears may have just answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4410.547s">It's</a> not clear to me who is on the committee or who puts people on the committee, but it sounds like what Councilor Bears is suggesting is that it says, this review shall be made by a special committee to be established by a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4424.371s">So</a> that would be the council that is <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4426.864s">I</a> just wanted to understand what that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.026s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6464.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6467.214s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6469.831s">So</a> I definitely am in favor of having a hybrid system that has some wards or districts and some at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6482.416s">To</a> me, whether it is four districts, eight wards, each of our wards has two parts, that would be 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6491.2s">That</a> to me is not as much of the question in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6496.656s">do</a> we have boards or districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6498.317s">If</a> we have four districts, we have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6500.257s">To</a> me, we are still using, like forming these more local elected offices, which I am in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6512.721s">I</a> do definitely appreciate a lot of what President Bears has said about first past the post, single district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6521.084s">Those</a> genuinely are, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6524.971s">not</a> the greatest way to elect people, not necessarily the best representation of democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6533.474s">They</a> also lead to long incumbencies because it is far more difficult to oust an incumbent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6546.558s">I</a> was very curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6548.219s">I</a> know that in Massachusetts, we do <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6552.715s">We</a> are a little bit of an outlier currently, especially with seven at large, but also in terms of the number of city councilors that we have for the size of our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6564.802s">And</a> I was really curious to look outside of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6569.325s">And</a> if I could share my screen.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6582.077s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6583.418s">I'm</a> sorry that this is so small. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6586.661s">And</a> this should only be, hang on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6593.406s">I</a> only wanna share that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6594.828s">Let</a> me see if I can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6600.613s">This</a> is the one I picked, but it didn't, oh, I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6602.374s">Oh,</a> okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6612.922s">Okay,</a> so what I did was I went ahead and I looked at other states and other cities, and I mean, I literally just went to Chattopiti, and I asked Chattopiti, please give me 10 cities in New England that are around 60,000 population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6635.668s">And</a> I said, please give me 10 cities in the South. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6637.829s">I</a> said, please give me 10 cities in the West, 10 cities in the Midwest, and I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6643.05s">Like,</a> you know, there was no picking of which cities these were. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6647.633s">These</a> are, I believe, a quite random sampling. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6652.076s">And</a> they're all, you know, somewhere around 60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6655.378s">And</a> I looked just to have an understanding of other states and other cities that aren't Massachusetts, and how many city councilors they have per population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6670.047s">So</a> there's a range. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6672.783s">I</a> think population per city council ranges from about 4,000 to about 15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6679.347s">There's</a> a lot of, you know, there's a big range. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6684.469s">There's</a> a large, there's wards or districts, and there's a lot of hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6690.312s">There</a> are a few that are purely wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6693.474s">And</a> what I thought was interesting is that at the number seven, and this has, I think it ended up with 48, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6701.589s">because</a> there was one that was 99,000, I got rid of that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6705.572s">So</a> there's 48 listed here and we just so happen in population per city councilor to rank 24th, which is exactly in the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6715.839s">And</a> again, this is a pretty random sampling of cities that are close to 60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6722.084s">So</a> I just wanted to sort of provide that as what I think is <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6727.621s">know,</a> looking, it includes some in Massachusetts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6732.245s">And</a> Massachusetts does tend to have far larger city councils per population than other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6741.033s">Maybe</a> we want to be more like other cities, maybe we think that other states and cities in the country also understand how to do a democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6750.182s">I</a> personally don't <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6752.045s">have</a> an opinion either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6753.246s">I</a> don't think that Massachusetts is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6756.248s">The</a> way we do things is necessarily better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6758.27s">I</a> don't think the way other states do it is necessarily better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6761.312s">But</a> I just thought it was interesting to kind of take a look at a random sampling of cities across the country that have approximately our population and what their size of city council is and also what their sort of composition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6774.662s">So</a> I just wanted to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6775.523s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3610.096s">I</a> was looking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3610.576s">I</a> didn't find it instantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3611.737s">So,</a> We don't have to stop the meeting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3621.364s">I</a> was just, I just thought it'd be interesting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3623.245s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3623.825s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-01-21_a6bZISOstiw/2025-01-21_a6bZISOstiw.html">City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee 01-21-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1.863s">Test</a> 1-2, test 1-2.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=89.03s">We're</a> ready to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=90.731s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=91.011s">Welcome</a> to the Public Works and Facilities Committee of January 21st, 2025, taking place at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=97.935s">in</a> the City Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=100.096s">Today,</a> we will cover two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=102.237s">One</a> is paper number 24-492, Resolution to Receive an Update on Roads, and the other one is 24-493, Resolution to Establish a Volunteer Tree Planting Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=112.643s">Before</a> we go on, Mr. Clerk, would you call the roll?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=131.002s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=133.985s">Then</a> we might as well move on to our first paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=138.288s">So</a> this is the resolution to receive an update on the roads, whereas it has been more than six months since the city council was last updated on our roads, and whereas during the election of November 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=148.775s">The</a> voters of Medford considered a budget override provision in Question 7 providing funds for, among other purposes, quote, fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works, $500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, unquote. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=166.454s">and</a> that ballot question was successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=168.536s">Now,</a> therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite engineer Owen Wartella and DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting that is today to talk about the state of the roads and the plan moving forward, given the outcome of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=184.708s">Thank</a> you so much to Commissioner McGibbon and Engineer Wartella for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=190.275s">I</a> would like to go ahead and pass the floor to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=193.819s">And</a> if you can give us an update on the roads, especially given the new budget, that would be great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=441.336s">Let</a> me see if there are any questions from the city council members. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=449.56s">Sorry,</a> I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=451.061s">Can</a> you help me with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=464.73s">on</a> the left. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=466.34s">We're</a> trying to click the green one and nothing's happening.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=688.397s">Yeah,</a> I don't actually have one other question before we go to you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1765.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1767.394s">I</a> just wanted to put in one last comment just because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1773.208s">You</a> know, a lot of this, we do this for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1776.189s">We</a> do this not just for us to understand because we're obviously involved in budget considerations, but we do this for people who are listening to be able to really understand what is happening with our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1787.35s">And</a> I just want to put this in a little bit of context that when we did our first roads assessment in, am I correct that it was 2019? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1793.371s">2021</a> was the first one? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.452s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.572s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.972s">Then</a> when we did the first roads assessment in 2021, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1802.691s">At</a> by that time, we are roads already were quite degraded in that 49% of our roads were in the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1813.492s">category</a> four and five of the five, one being the best and five being the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1819.395s">So</a> we found ourselves, you guys are in a situation where you're trying to dig us out of a hole that has come from the past and from the fact that maybe they didn't have the information because there was no roads assessment, maybe utilities were not being kept track of and so they, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1842.245s">No</a> one was preventing the degrading that they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1845.866s">And</a> for who knows what other reason, not enough funding or whatever else, that we found ourselves at the first roads assessment in 2021 with roads that are quite degraded, and now trying to dig ourselves out when just to stay at the same level would cost $5 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1864.988s">Would</a> you say that's relatively accurate?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1870.373s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1870.974s">Five</a> would be just able to begin improvement.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1876.379s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1876.539s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1877.039s">So</a> just for people to understand sort of the context of where we are in terms of this roads update. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1882.885s">So,</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1884.466s">Is</a> there anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1885.407s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1886.168s">Let</a> me go to Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1969.313s">Thanks</a> so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1969.774s">I</a> would just want to see if you have any last things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1971.776s">I</a> know we do have another agenda item that I'm hoping to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1974.319s">Is</a> there anything else you'd want to add about roads?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1988.876s">Starts</a> with a single step. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1990.136s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1990.357s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1991.717s">So</a> if we can, I would love to move on to 24-493, which is the resolution to establish a volunteer tree planting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2000.0s">Whereas</a> Medford loses an estimated 500 or more trees each year and plants less than 250 trees each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2006.383s">And</a> whereas the cost of planting city trees is primarily in the labor to plant the trees rather than the cost of the sapling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2012.585s">and</a> whereas Medford only has one full-time staff member dedicated to our trees, the tree warden, and whereas Medford currently contracts out for tree planting, which is more expensive than planting with an in-house crew, and whereas trees are a vital part of fighting climate change, help cool buildings and streets in summer, and add to the beauty of our city, and whereas Medford has many residents who want to volunteer to plant city trees, therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting, that is today, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2040.4s">to</a> begin discussing the possibility of allowing Medford residents to volunteer to help plant city trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2047.222s">This</a> is a project near and dear to my heart that I talked about a lot as I was campaigning a year ago last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2056.465s">So</a> I would love to just open the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2061.647s">I</a> really appreciate Commissioner McIvern that you are open to discussing this possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2068.544s">There</a> are other cities in Massachusetts that do allow residents to help volunteer to help plant city trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2078.247s">And</a> I would love to hear your thoughts about whether this is a project that we could start looking into here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2085.769s">I</a> know a lot of residents who are actually excited to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2088.45s">So</a> if you can give us a little bit of sort of your opening thoughts.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2145.122s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2145.943s">Can</a> you tell me a few, I have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2150.025s">What</a> season is the best for tree planting?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2176.002s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2178.104s">So</a> a couple other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2184.207s">How</a> comfortable would you feel with a volunteer, volunteer coordinator, or do we need to wait for a budget item to come and put a halftime person in the budget before you would feel comfortable with a position like this?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2232.054s">Let</a> me go ahead and go to councilors for any questions or comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2236.698s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2442.204s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2442.685s">A</a> couple other questions, if you've thought a little bit about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2449.031s">Aside</a> from a volunteer coordinator, do you see any kind of structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2451.573s">Like,</a> how would this fit in with the tree warden or with anything else in the DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2455.938s">Like,</a> what would you imagine to be like a structurally, how would it work?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2507.676s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2512.349s">Any</a> other, I can think of a bunch of next steps that I will, by the way, I have talked to Chief Medford about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2519.096s">And</a> so I think I have some other next steps for me personally that I want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2522.639s">Do</a> you see other next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2525.522s">You</a> know, I'm thinking like a pilot, like we get something in the budget and then <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2532.297s">figure</a> out like a place where we could do a pilot project where we can do one or two tree plantings in a particular neighborhood and you know work through the warden and the volunteer coordinator and really have a first project to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2545.985s">Just</a> curious if you see sort of other sort of next steps that we would do in this process.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2624.347s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2625.927s">Are</a> there any other questions either from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2628.508s">Well,</a> from councillors first. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2633.889s">Are</a> there any questions from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2641.031s">I</a> see one and I don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2648.173s">Amanda</a> Bowe, we have asked you to unmute.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2715.748s">That</a> is so exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2717.571s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2718.473s">I</a> really appreciate you bringing that to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2720.537s">You're</a> going to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2723.442s">Anyone</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2730.389s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2730.95s">On</a> that note, I believe we are at the end of this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2736.095s">I</a> so again, super appreciate that you're open to the idea, really looking forward to moving this forward either through the administration with a part time volunteer coordinator or with a nonprofit, but potentially working with <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2750.531s">you</a> know, the Mr. Graber Water Association or some other nonprofit, and of course with Trees Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2755.795s">Thank</a> you so much, Trees Medford, for the work that you have done in previous years on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2761.959s">And</a> with that being said, is there a motion on the floor?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2778.209s">with</a> a motion to adjourn from Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2781.291s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2785.914s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2791.818s">Mr.</a> Clerk, would you please call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2794.32s">Oh,</a> do we need to call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2796.001s">We</a> don't need to call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2797.302s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2798.102s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2798.782s">And</a> all opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2799.903s">We</a> have three in favor, one opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2804.066s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2805.027s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2025-01-15_7W6Pc0j59SY/2025-01-15_7W6Pc0j59SY.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 01-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2742.186s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2743.167s">First,</a> I'll say that given the garbled nature of the Zoom <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2747.008s">call</a> and the complicated nature of the request, I definitely need that reread because I did not understand what that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2755.552s">I</a> had a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2757.053s">Number</a> one, I'm really excited about the idea of historic conversions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2760.555s">I</a> think that's wonderful, like not changing the exterior of the building but allowing for it to become maybe, you know, a five-bedroom becomes a two-bedroom and a three-bedroom is such a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2772.285s">And</a> then I wanted to ask a little bit about the NR2 and NR3 areas that used to be single-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2780.028s">And</a> I'm specifically thinking about, as I look at the map, like Lawrence Estates and those parts of West Medford that were single-family, single-family one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2791.492s">And</a> curious, because you did mention that you're trying to get it to reflect what's currently there, <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2798.394s">Do</a> you think that in those areas, the two-unit and three-unit allowance under these new zoning neighborhoods, is that reflective or is that going to be a significant change in those two areas, the Lawrence Estates and the West Medford?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3062.909s">Yeah,</a> no, mostly I was kind of, what I was looking at, and thanks for pointing out this particular map, because now I can actually see it for myself and zoom in on it, but like in that Lawrence Estates especially, it really does look like it's currently mostly single family, and we are, you know, upping it by one and two, <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3084.62s">potentially</a> like, you know, one and two levels more. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3089.043s">So,</a> just, I just wanted to know how much change was suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3096.287s">I</a> had a question that is perhaps a silly one, but I was curious when I look at the, the <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3103.243s">sort</a> of diagram, the very last page that has the two and a half stories and the three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3108.246s">And</a> I know that I see that architecture all over the place and like the two and a half story looks, you know, a certain way and the three story looks very like blocky and cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3119.815s">how</a> much does it, that half story matter to like not blocking people's view or not blocking people's sunlight or not blocking other things because like as an architectural piece and for the amount of extra space people get in their homes, like it, I don't know, to me seems like that might be nicer actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3140.165s">But</a> I'm just like, this is a, I'm totally not an architecture person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3143.507s">So</a> I'm just curious more than anything, not making a suggestion.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3652.659s">Go</a> for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3653.119s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3654.44s">So</a> what I heard Zach say is the opposite of what I wrote down that you read. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3660.265s">So</a> my understanding is that now the lightest yellow and the northern parts of Lawrence Estates and the middle part of West Medford would all include two-unit dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3671.274s">That's</a> what I heard, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3672.555s">That's</a> what I heard in the rereading of the <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3676.482s">thing</a> and I am concerned because I think that's I'm not really comfortable if that's what we're doing is making every like two unit everywhere like that's I believe president bears please step in and correct me I think it's the opposite I think it's that yeah I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that this is an increment too far and each shade should go down one increment <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3697.423s">That</a> is, I feel much more comfortable about that, but I'm a little concerned about the wording because to me, the wording said the other.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3725.267s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3726.168s">I'm</a> much more comfortable with that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3840.12s">We</a> got a lively debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3841.001s">This</a> is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3842.461s">So</a> I am in favor of sex change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3845.683s">And</a> I'll just let you know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3848.104s">I</a> think, like, I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are allowing for historic conversions and ADUs by right throughout what is currently considered single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3861.871s">To</a> me, that is enough change in those areas that I do not feel like we need to move further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3868.875s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3870.157s">we</a> will get pushback from the community is my concern that, you know, that's a little bit like those areas of Lawrence Estates and West Medford that already that is, I think, excellent and just the right amount of change that we're going to allow that doesn't really change a character of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3890.795s">I</a> think once we're allowing two units, that for me, that <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3898.82s">belongs</a> more in the areas that were on this new map considered neighborhood residential three. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3911.13s">And</a> that also will be a change for much of those places, but I'm comfortable with that level of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3917.235s">So</a> I feel quite good, and I think better than the current <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3923.499s">suggestion,</a> given that I do understand that because of some of the existing housing that is there, because you guys plotted this very carefully, that the boundaries are going to adjust a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3935.101s">But</a> to me, this feels more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3937.882s">And</a> it also does mean, because of the ADUs and the historic conversions by right, that we are allowing more housing throughout the city, but just in a way that I think feels more comfortable to the residents of the single-family, current single-family one areas.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4112.688s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4113.989s">So</a> I know that one thing that is a top topic for people in our city to talk about and to complain about is roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4124.618s">For</a> perfectly good reason, we got into a hole because the roads and sidewalks were not properly updated for many, many, many, many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4134.767s">So</a> we are doing our best as a city to dig ourselves out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4138.67s">I</a> think my plan, so we had one, we had the, <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4141.462s">DBW</a> commissioner, as well as the lead engineer, come to a meeting in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4145.985s">They</a> will be coming to another meeting, which I thought was going to be in December, but it turns out it's going to be in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4151.85s">And</a> I think my goal is to have them come in twice a year, just to give updates to the public, have a public meeting with them there, being able to report, see how we're doing in terms of getting our roads back from the brink and really getting us on that uptake where every year our average road <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4171.184s">rating</a> is getting better instead of getting worse, which has been happening for a long time in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4177.706s">So</a> that's kind of my plan on that one, is to have them come in a couple of times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4180.867s">I</a> know Councilor Bears has also asked for some information from our building commissioner and some others on city facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4190.01s">So</a> I will check in with President Bears about that, and perhaps we can have one where we have an update <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4197.052s">on</a> that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4199.453s">We</a> have the public restrooms and parks and squares that has come into our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4203.614s">We're</a> working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4206.715s">Lead</a> ordinance, clearly with the notifications that came out from the city about lead pipes, I think it is more on people's minds than it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4214.898s">It</a> is something that has always been important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4218.739s">And</a> so I hope that in the new year, we do start working on this lead ordinance, which we have not yet given a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4227.523s">There</a> is also a home rule petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4233.145s">Vice</a> President Collins, do you want to give us a tiny update on that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4265.551s">it</a> will likely go on the back burner when we discuss these projects at a committee meeting in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4271.718s">Public</a> utility accountability, I will say when I have spoken to staff, they are actually doing a really excellent job compared to prior years and prior administrations on holding our public utilities accountable and forcing them to do road repair and sidewalk repair <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4289.056s">as</a> much as we are legally allowed to force them to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4292.962s">So,</a> we can maybe also get an update on that from the DPW commissioner when they when they come into our committee to talk about roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4304.041s">The</a> Tree Planting Volunteer Network is something that I talked about a lot on the campaign trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4309.505s">It's</a> probably my absolute favorite policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4311.407s">I'm</a> very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4312.467s">And</a> at our next public works meeting in January, the public works commissioner will be, sorry, DPW commissioner will be having our first discussion about how to implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4327.738s">This</a> is basically allowing residents, because most of the cost of planting trees in the city <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4332.943s">replacing,</a> we lose far more trees than we replace, so we're losing trees every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4340.482s">And</a> for sure, the major cost of that is labor and not the price of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4346.923s">So</a> the goal is to allow residents to volunteer, to work together with training, with appropriate trees, with the appropriate depth, doing it all the right way, but to allow residents to plant city trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4364.148s">So</a> it does sound like that is something that the administration is amenable to, and I'm really looking forward to our first conversation about that in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4373.676s">And</a> aside from that, we are just, you know, reviewing other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4378.42s">So</a> I'm looking forward to 2025 and us getting some of those things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4382.804s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4772.704s">I</a> was just going to say it's been a pleasure to be working with you all in this first year, my first year of being an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4779.27s">I</a> appreciate all the support that everyone has given in just understanding how things work and whom to talk to for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4787.356s">And</a> I really appreciate the way that we've been working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4790.839s">Also</a> appreciate the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4792.02s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Clerk, for all the work that you do for the city.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4796.944s">Yes,</a> and thanks to everyone who is tuning in, whether it's live or after the fact to any city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4805.033s">We</a> appreciate your participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4807.095s">We</a> appreciate you keeping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4809.357s">Appreciate</a> the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4810.298s">We</a> appreciate all the communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4811.82s">And</a> please do reach out and let us know what we can do for you in the new year.<h2><a href="../2024-12-17_cCFTFy23gjY/2024-12-17_cCFTFy23gjY.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 12-17-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1999.701s">Steal</a> my thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2000.621s">I</a> basically was going to see if you had, like, how short is your short version of your presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2004.823s">And</a> if there's something you can give that's five minutes or less that can really give us an overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2009.965s">And</a> as well, if you can also give us a little bit of an understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2016.669s">exactly</a> how important the timing is and whether getting something, you know, obviously this is a process, it would not be approved tonight, it has three readings, whether us bringing it forward tonight is crucial to the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2030.463s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4133.615s">Real</a> quick, this was something that I have dealt with a lot being a renter, living in a lot of different houses, all of which I led when my child was under six years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4143.101s">And</a> I do think that it's crucially important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4147.364s">I'm</a> very excited that Medford is incentivizing people and giving people this opportunity to get those fixed and providing a little bit of help with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4154.708s">I</a> also understand that this is simply <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4157.85s">putting</a> it in place so that it can be used by the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4162.133s">Obviously,</a> that'll depend on how many applications come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4164.575s">So</a> I'm very happy to support this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5177.962s">I</a> actually would make a motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5179.903s">I</a> would sever it into five. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5181.203s">Perhaps</a> we can do that after public discussion or whatever before or after either one is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5186.504s">But</a> I think there's one that's about the essentially lines two and four, which are the cost of terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5194.246s">Then</a> the one in the middle, that line three, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5198.207s">Uh</a> inviting all communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5199.708s">I</a> think that's a a separate one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5202.209s">Um</a> there's a question of the bond rating is a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5205.651s">The</a> question of the private investigators is the fourth and the question of the drug testing is a fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5210.313s">That</a> would be my suggestion to sever it into those five.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6828.433s">comment</a> was actually from earlier just to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6831.915s">To</a> the person who's asking us to respond that like actually, I think I at least for one Councilor was really hoping to hear from the public first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6839.539s">I</a> did not want to interrupt and put in my own comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6842.441s">I</a> really wanted to hear a little bit more about what people had gone through and experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6846.703s">That</a> was why I was not responding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6849.264s">I</a> also do hope that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6853.386s">Are</a> we going to sever before we discuss each one or are we going to sever at the very last second? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6858.968s">I</a> think it might be easier to sever and then discuss each piece.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7737.067s">My</a> mic is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7738.027s">Does</a> that mean I am allowed to speak?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7745.172s">I</a> would just say that I, I think rule 21 is <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7749.25s">very</a> unhealthy for us to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7752.132s">I</a> think that we should use it incredibly sparingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7755.634s">I</a> believe that a financial paper is in fact one that moves funding, and we are not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7760.137s">This</a> does not actually move any funding anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7763.319s">So</a> to me, classifying this as a finance paper with regards to Rule 21 really makes Rule 21 far more broad than I am comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7774.405s">I</a> did not think that was what, like, I don't read rule 21 as saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7779.888s">So,</a> you know, I think a ton of people have come here to hear our thoughts on this and to hear us make, you know, either move this forward or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7787.793s">And</a> I think it is, it's not really the best, I think, for anyone if we do not allow this discussion to have a conclusion tonight.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7964.88s">It's</a> her motion to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7965.96s">Can</a> you please repeat exactly how you want to sever it?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8086.642s">The</a> reason I had split it into five was because the first and third sentences, their cost associated with terminating school superintendent's contract and anticipated costs of superintendent search committee and interim appointment, those to me seem to go together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8101.951s">Asking</a> for any and all communications, corresponding meeting minutes, I may have a very different opinion of that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8108.054s">So</a> I would start. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8110.435s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8820.785s">I</a> would be in favor of something that was not exactly this, but that requested from the administration to understand what is our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8830.471s">What</a> is the reason which we are doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8832.212s">I</a> mean, for me, both of these last two paragraphs are, I will say, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8839.184s">I</a> hope we have a really good reason if we are doing either of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8844.867s">I</a> looked a little bit into different state laws, in different states, different state laws on drug testing, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8856.632s">And</a> it has to be only under certain circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8863.436s">So</a> I think for me, I really want to have an explanation of what our policy is as a city for both of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8874.289s">And</a> if we are doing either of these, what the reasoning is behind it, I don't think that I am completely ready to vote yes on this before I have more information, a flat-out cease and desist, although it does, like, I mean, hearing the language, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8896.714s">may</a> seem attractive, but before I have more information, I'm not willing to vote yes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8900.918s">I</a> would vote yes if this were amended to say we want to know a full policy, we want to understand, you know, when this is used, and then the cost as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8936.186s">let</a> me do my best to request that the city administration provide its policy regarding the use of private investigators with regards to any city all any or all its city employees and then I'm okay with the second sentence be it further resolved that the city administration report back with the identified line items in the budget
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.175s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.955s">If</a> I may, I have to say, I am overall, whenever I have looked into specific questions, things like how much free cash we get at the end of the budget year, and whether that is something that is viewed by the state of Massachusetts, by bond agencies, et cetera, as is that something positive or negative? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9080.942s">There</a> are other things that I have looked into that the city has done that have been questions about what the city is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9086.725s">And</a> when I've looked into very specific things like those, I am usually, I find that what, or for example, the other one is like creating capital stabilization funds, these sorts of things, I have found that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9105.928s">the</a> city administration is actually doing things that are considered, in those two cases, considered best practice by the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9116.018s">And</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9123.135s">I,</a> if, if we were a city council where I genuinely believed that the mayor or the administration were doing something that I disagreed with, even if it were the purview of the mayor, I, as a city Councilor, I would feel comfortable making a motion that says the city council does not agree with X, Y, Z practice if that were the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9146.014s">Um,</a> so I just want to make it clear that I don't think that we as a city council are <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9151.918s">in</a> any way trapped against saying what we believe our opinion of what the administration should be doing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9158.602s">I</a> think that we can say the same thing to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9160.423s">We</a> can't control Tufts, but we sure can say we wish Tufts were doing something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9164.606s">We</a> would like Tufts to do something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9166.047s">I</a> think we can say that to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9169.769s">So</a> a slight disagreement, I think, with my fellow Councilor, or maybe not, but if I was understanding you correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9177.293s">I</a> just think I don't have the information, and I really want to have a lot more information before I make any kind of decision on something that would say something so strongly worded as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9192.616s">But</a> I'm happy that I think we're going to get a wording change, and we'll be able to get a little more information.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9328.42s">I</a> actually, to be honest, I would like to know what our drug policy testing is for all city employees.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9370.741s">I</a> do think that the reasons for these particular tests, I would be interested in that as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9386.021s">I</a> honestly I think that we might because of the reading that I did on drug testing in different states in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9395.806s">There</a> are certain, there are only certain times that it can be done, it is not at the whim of the mayor or anyone else in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9403.809s">there,</a> you know, it falls into certain categories where it is legal and then other categories where it is not legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9409.714s">So</a> I imagine that we will, we will get an answer that at least will fall into like some vague category. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9415.418s">And</a> I would be happy with that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9601.856s">I</a> wanna have some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9604.758s">Um</a> the requested meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9607.28s">So,</a> I'm assuming this is a meeting between the administration and the fire department that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9614.326s">Like,</a> can you be a little bit more clear?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9639.115s">So</a> you're asking that the meeting with the council also include the fire chief and the union leadership.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9649.923s">But</a> that if there needs to be an executive session, we would have that without those folks.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11918.615s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11919.215s">I</a> just wanted to say how much I appreciated the comment about our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11922.957s">I</a> think it's always really important to discuss our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11926.699s">And</a> I agree that in the comprehensive plan, it really is sort of filled with that kind of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11932.482s">And</a> you can read about what people in the community, what values other folks who live here wanted to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11938.746s">I</a> know for myself, one of my highest values is a sense of community and vibrancy and people being able to walk to a place that they <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11948.271s">meet</a> with their neighbors and really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11950.573s">So</a> that's something I'm always thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11952.354s">I</a> know for Mystic Ave, it really is not a place that people just love to walk down. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11959.92s">So</a> it's something that we've really been trying to work on is to make Mystic Ave something that serves us as a community and as residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11970.409s">But</a> another underlying thing that we understand that people want is there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11977.034s">more</a> new growth right so that new growth is both going to be commercial businesses moving in it's also going to be about new housing that brings in new revenue to the city they both bring in revenue to the city so I think those are among the many different things as well as well as you know we have these new green score that is going to bring more places which I think were mentioned about like <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12000.836s">where</a> young and old people can, you know, spend time together where there's trees, where there's benches to sit on and places to, you know, to chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12008.741s">We're</a> going to be incentivizing that from developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12011.182s">So</a> these are all things that I think we have, we have brought forward as, as values. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12016.566s">Each</a> of us individually has values, but we also have some values that came out of the comprehensive plan that we are trying to make happen through the zoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12024.671s">So</a> thank you so much for asking about that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13837.287s">Yeah,</a> I also not inclined to agree with any sort of waiving of three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13841.272s">I</a> think the three readings are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13842.613s">Also,</a> there were a lot of changes that just came in recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13845.176s">So</a> I think, you know, I'm comfortable passing it for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13849.701s">It'll,</a> you know, give me a chance to go through line by line every single change that was made, which I know was recommended by KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13857.433s">And</a> I would be perfectly fine if we want to make an official request that in between our first reading and the third reading that we ask the police chief to come to a
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13873.771s">But</a> I think it's a different request when it's past first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13878.674s">So</a> if we want to make a request that he show up to a committee meeting where we can discuss this and any reservations he has, I would be open to that as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13896.844s">So</a> we get it in between.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13902.048s">Ah,</a> yeah, right.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15747.716s">I</a> was just going to suggest that maybe public comment at this meeting is not the best, like given that late hour and everything else is maybe not exactly when we want to be line by lining, you know, specific wording and that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15761.943s">you</a> know, the sponsors of the legislation working with, you know, like between now and third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15768.826s">Does</a> that make sense that that might be a better way to make edits that may be doing it right now?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20675.023s">Yeah,</a> I would simply request that we do the same thing we did for the last thing, which is just remove strike table abuse regulations line eight.<h2><a href="../2024-12-11_pUMtYvwLQbQ/2024-12-11_pUMtYvwLQbQ.html">City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee 12-11-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4142.145s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4142.665s">Just</a> one incredibly short for anyone who heard us talk about co-living. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4146.988s">I</a> want people to be reassured. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4148.809s">Co-living</a> literally does not mean anything outside of a normal rental apartment being rented by people who are not related to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4155.754s">That's</a> literally it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4156.574s">It's</a> not congregate housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4158.055s">It's</a> not any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4159.376s">It's</a> incredibly simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4160.637s">It's</a> really adding nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4163.099s">And</a> if you want me to explain to you why we are putting it in the zoning, I'm happy to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4168.482s">you</a> know, why we're trying to differentiate between that and other kinds of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4171.524s">But</a> it's nothing changing, nothing new in that particular definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4176.067s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-27_fYmm4ApgnRY/2024-11-27_fYmm4ApgnRY.html">City Council 11-26-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2719.759s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2723.721s">As</a> everyone has already said, thank you so much for all your work so far this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2727.662s">There's</a> a lot going on for you, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2729.163s">And</a> thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2731.897s">So,</a> I have some numbers that are from housing Medford, and I just want to ask you if you think this is like close to accurate that we have approximately 47% single family homes, we have about 32% that have two to four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2751.004s">We</a> have about 2.5% that have five to nine units, about 2.5% that have 10 to 19 units, and 15% or so that have more than 20 units.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.066s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.526s">Can</a> you explain this a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2795.446s">Because</a> I just see these columns are like 101, 102. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2797.867s">Yeah,</a> so sorry.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2860.54s">Yep,</a> so what I'm looking for is percentage of the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2863.742s">So</a> it's hard to find that in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2867.505s">What</a> I'm trying to understand and what I have from Housing Medford, which I'm asking you if it's relatively close, is of our residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2874.069s">We're</a> talking about a residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2876.991s">We</a> need to compare residential to residential in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2882.094s">So</a> that almost half of our residential, less than half is single families.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2921.012s">Yeah,</a> well, we have to vote today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2922.493s">So</a> I'm trying to kind of understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2924.314s">Okay,</a> so- For this discussion, rather than waiting until after we have the vote, I'd like to have that information for this discussion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2936.658s">Yeah,</a> maybe I can ask a couple other questions first, so we can have everything at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2942.663s">The</a> way that I'm looking at it, and I understand the arguments for that if you're above the threshold, then your taxes will go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2952.93s">If</a> you're below the threshold, probably your taxes will go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2957.99s">It</a> seems to me that we have, it looks like, just under 50% that are single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2966.132s">Those</a> people are almost all certainly Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2970.473s">Maybe</a> 30% or so of our residential housing is between two and four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2975.735s">Some</a> of those are going to be Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2977.855s">Some</a> of them are not going to be Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2980.896s">And</a> then 20% is five units or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2984.177s">And</a> those are almost certainly not owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2989.207s">It</a> sure seems to me that if we are looking at this from the sense of how can we benefit Medford residents and how can we especially benefit Medford residents who <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3005.842s">Our</a> working class are people who, you know, we have a really large cohort of people who moved here, when we were affordable, because this was where working class people could afford to buy, and those people most of them now are seniors, they're on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3025.134s">You</a> know, I'm thinking about this a lot because today is when we're supposed to be voting on this residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3030.099s">It</a> is really our last chance to make a decision like this before the taxes from the Prop 2.5 override go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3043.03s">And</a> so it really seems to me, and especially you have said that, what would happen is condos go down, single families, some would go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3054.318s">And</a> then two and three families are the ones that are going to be starting to be the ones that are paying more, as well as the much larger properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3066.038s">you</a> know, from my perspective, it really seems like we are now in that position, given the valuation that you, the sort of threshold of 982,000, that we really are gonna be benefiting almost all of our Medford residents, and certainly the ones who are most in need, by passing this residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3089.686s">And</a> so my second question for you, because I understand that, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3098.892s">it</a> is considered that we would have had to do this earlier in the cycle in order for this to happen, but this was not on our agenda earlier in the cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3108.82s">It</a> sure seems to me that if the administration believes that this could not be voted on now, and it needed to be voted on six months earlier, then the administration should have put this on our agenda six months earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3127.08s">I'm</a> having trouble with the fact that we are supposed to take a vote tonight, and yet we're told we cannot vote in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.243s">And</a> I'm not blaming you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.944s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3136.504s">I'm</a> looking at you, which I'm probably supposed to be looking at the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3139.227s">In</a> no way do I think this is, I hope you don't hear me as if I am putting this on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3147.916s">I</a> am not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3148.997s">But</a> I do think that this is something that we are supposed to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3153.581s">It</a> is our job to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3155.443s">This</a> is something I believe would benefit <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3159.019s">almost</a> all of the homeowners in Medford, except for those who own multifamilies and have some rental income. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3167.642s">And</a> I am feeling frustrated that we are now told that we are not allowed to vote in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3174.564s">So</a> my question for you is, what would happen <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3179.449s">if</a> we voted in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3181.27s">What</a> would the city have to go through? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3183.231s">How</a> much pain and difficulty and money would it cost if we voted in favor for the city to actually get this stuff done on time? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3193.496s">Can</a> we hire enough consultants or full-time employees or whatever to make this thing happen?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3244.514s">Can</a> you talk a little bit more about the overlay account?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3372.23s">So</a> it's not that we would have to get out of the overlay account, it's that we would have to have come here to this meeting with an option <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3379.975s">of</a> a tax rate that would cover that, but is the question that you don't know what that tax rate is because you don't know how many?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3397.122s">Because</a> you haven't had the applications come in yet?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3403.805s">And</a> I just want to understand, you couldn't, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3410.083s">yesterday</a> or tonight and we post on the news tomorrow, just saying hypotheticals, you could not come up with that number.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3418.807s">You</a> could not come up with the appropriate tax rate for us to have a residential exemption.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3453.479s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3454.9s">So</a> how does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3456.58s">Like,</a> let's say we wanna pass this as soon as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3462.623s">When</a> do you open up those? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3464.124s">I</a> mean, since the city hasn't passed it yet, would the city have to then pass it <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3469.164s">This</a> is what you're saying, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3470.864s">The</a> city would have to pass it in maybe June so that you can receive enough applications so that when it comes to tonight's vote in late November, you can set the rate, which you can't set because we don't have any applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3487.047s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3541.606s">I</a> would like to make a motion that we ask KP Law exactly how we do that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3585.067s">Do</a> you happen to have the other numbers for like two or three families or over five or anything like that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3602.311s">We're</a> apparently not gonna vote on it tonight anyway, so we can get another time.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3609.872s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3648.871s">But</a> that's parcels and not units.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3653.032s">So</a> units would be useful.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3670.962s">Can</a> I make another motion?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3698.657s">Thank</a> you for the assessor's office to provide us with the percentages and numbers of the single family, two family, three family, four family, five to nine, 10 to 19, over 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3717.0s">as</a> well as valuations, average valuations, I think, for them.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.023s">That'd</a> be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.903s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3723.163s">Or</a> any other information that you think would be helpful for us to make a decision about a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3728.486s">Understood.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4280.657s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4282.058s">I</a> hope it is not considered off topic to talk about the residential exemption that is on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4289.884s">So</a> I'm just curious, do we have good information on the multifamily housing and how many are owner-occupied? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4297.49s">Is</a> that something that you could provide to us?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4316.799s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4318.98s">If</a> it's something you can provide, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4321.321s">If</a> you don't know, then yeah, I totally get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4323.842s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4324.122s">I</a> was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4325.383s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-21_0fZ4E0HakWA/2024-11-21_0fZ4E0HakWA.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 11-20-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=631.663s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=632.904s">So</a> I want to give a little brief history. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=635.625s">As</a> President Bears mentioned, this was introduced by Councilor Knight in 2019, early in that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=640.827s">It</a> also went to the Energy and Environment Committee later that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=647.39s">In</a> 2021, it was looked at by the zoning subcommittee, and they allowed the trees Medford volunteer organization in Medford to draft and submit revised ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=660.578s">Later</a> in 2021 that came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=663.3s">And</a> then in 2022, that ordinance was split into three parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=667.906s">And</a> so those three parts are the ones that we'll be looking at today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=671.79s">One</a> creates a tree committee for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=675.394s">One</a> is about public shade trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=678.378s">And</a> the third one is about private trees, trees on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=683.343s">So</a> because it's been so long and because there have been a number of changes made, our goals today are really to sort of get everyone up to speed, all the city councilors, the members of the staff, and everyone else up to speed on where these ordinances are at to <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=706.601s">figure</a> out what our next steps are, and to basically set when is the next time that we will be discussing these ordinances in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=714.921s">So</a> that's kind of the goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=716.682s">And</a> on that note, I would love to have, I'm very excited that we have a wonderful group of volunteers here in the city from Trees Medford who have done a lot of work on this over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=731.652s">And</a> I know that they have a long history with this and they have offered to give a, they wrote a letter and if they wouldn't mind reading that in or I could read that for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=743.95s">or</a> President Bears's gonna be there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=745.551s">But</a> then after that, if we can maybe begin with the tree committee ordinance, and if they can give us a tiny introduction to the tree committee ordinance, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=755.574s">So</a> I don't know if they wanna go ahead and come up to the podium.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=764.797s">Go</a> for it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=953.683s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=955.044s">So</a> if we want to go ahead and start with the tree committee ordinance, I'm happy to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=961.43s">What</a> we have is a redlined version. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=969.697s">And</a> Councilor Beres, can you go ahead and let us know for this redlined version, what are the different colors? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=976.162s">What</a> are the things that are added or removed?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1015.02s">So</a> actually.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1020.004s">Zach</a> just did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1021.065s">He</a> took your version, and he created a red line. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1023.647s">Because</a> we can't look at the.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1042.107s">So</a> I don't know exactly what we feel is the best way to go through this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1053.457s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1055.138s">Do</a> people want me to read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1056.559s">Should</a> we just read it silently? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1058.041s">Should</a> I read it out loud for your call?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1067.889s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1068.109s">I</a> mean, I'm only just seeing this now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1075.655s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1077.716s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1078.157s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1450.367s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1450.868s">Yeah,</a> my only question is, I think that the intention is to provide help so that in case, you know, given the new ordinances, there is in fact more work to do that the tree committee might be able to help with that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1466.083s">So</a> I just want to be, I want to get your input, like if the language has changed to be like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1473.33s">you</a> know, when needed, help support DPW in? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1477.113s">Like,</a> would it be okay to include these things?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1729.554s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to mention the changes to the appointments and see if anyone had any comments on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1736.539s">Sounds</a> like, you know, five men for residence up to 10 total, two youth members, one who demonstrates expertise in the field of urban forestry and landscape design. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1747.746s">Just</a> wanted to see if there were any comments on that particular portion since we didn't really, nobody really made any comments before we move on.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1788.391s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1788.971s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1789.352s">Unless,</a> are you interested in doing an intro to this one or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1799.538s">I</a> could just do a little bit of the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1801.519s">It</a> does, this one is preserving, protecting public shade trees and trees otherwise located on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1810.217s">And</a> it is different from the third one, which is trees on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1816.663s">So</a> it looks like, let me see if I can do a little bit about the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1821.828s">Looks</a> like there are some changes to the intent and purpose, adding something about MGL Chapter 40A. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1831.777s">A</a> paragraph about that and state legislature granting municipalities rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1838.621s">It</a> does talk about establishing a tree fund to supplement the city budget for tree maintenance, tree planting, stump removal and site preparation for tree planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1852.003s">A</a> few changes in the definitions of caliper in terms of diameters of the tree trunks measured. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1861.17s">A</a> few very small minor changes in construction and demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1870.578s">Then</a> this looks like more changes to the diameter at breast height. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1879.741s">Tree</a> diameter in inches measured four and a half feet above the ground for multi stem trees size determined by the measure of all trunks, then adding the total diameter of largest trunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1889.209s">A</a> new definition of drip line the area directly under the tree at the outer circumference of the tree branches, where most the rainwater shed from the tree canopy drips to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1901.718s">Then</a> also a new definition of a landmark tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1906.061s">Any</a> healthy tree may be designated as a landmark tree if it meets one or more of the following criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1911.105s">A,</a> a tree that is documented to be 50 years old or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1914.628s">B,</a> is 24 inches in diameter or more at breast height. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1918.471s">C,</a> represents a rare species. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1921.173s">D,</a> is associated with a historical event or person, unusual feature, or scenic enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1926.557s">All</a> landmark trees are protected trees, except those listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1933.24s">Then</a> a few very small changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1935.421s">A</a> change to protective trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1942.264s">The</a> change to protective trees is accepting trees listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1950.189s">Looks</a> like a new definition of the tree fund, an account established pursuant to this ordinance for the deposit of payments for mitigating tree removal in lieu of tree replanting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1959.875s">This</a> fund may only be expended as a means of promoting a healthy tree canopy and will be applied to the cost of site preparation, tree replanting, and new tree maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1969.761s">And</a> a few other very small changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1974.944s">The</a> tree warden has some some new language in it, which really is defined in saying as defined in GLC 87 S2 and Medford Ordinances 1974 Chapter 26 Section 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1987.831s">The</a> tree warden is the city employee responsible for the management of city cities, public trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1994.455s">Applicability</a> these versions shall apply to the activities related to trees on public land. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2001.201s">Changes</a> to tree permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2005.004s">In</a> addition, if a public tree has fallen on a house resulting in damage to windows, puncturing roofs, or similar significant damage requiring immediate action, the homeowner may proceed to have the tree taken down after notifying the tree warden and no permit is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2020.563s">Also</a> under that section of tree permit, city tree removal and replacement, a hearing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2026.508s">When</a> the city removes a tree from the sidewalk strip, it must replace the tree within the next planting cycle unless the following procedures are followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2032.974s">A,</a> if a tree is cut down by the city and is not to be replaced in the next planting cycle, the city must hold a hearing and invite interested parties, tree groups, and residents within the city block to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2041.841s">The</a> hearing must provide the opportunity for community members to contest the decision not to replace the tree in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2047.466s">B,</a> the decision must be announced on the city's website for one month prior to a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2051.95s">C,</a> if the intention is not to replace the tree at all, one month prior to the hearing, the city must inform members of each residence within the city block in writing of their intention not to replace the tree and the reason why the city seeks to reduce the tree canopy in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2064.641s">The</a> city should plant with native trees wherever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2067.023s">Removal</a> of a public tree must include stump removal within 60 days of the tree removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2070.866s">If</a> removal of a stump within 60 days is not possible, the city must inform residents of the date of removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2076.488s">And</a> there are more changes under tree planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2084.834s">Promote</a> an equitable and diverse urban tree canopy that provides adequate shade for all its neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2090.078s">That's</a> an addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2093.36s">Looks</a> like a lot of changes under record keeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2096.209s">The</a> city will maintain an updated inventory of all public trees, tree removals, and stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2101.231s">The</a> tree warden shall keep a publicly available electronic record of removal requests, which shall include the species and size of trees to be removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the trees documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractors involved, and the name and address of the person who requests removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2117.156s">The</a> city will maintain and make publicly available in electronic form an inventory of trees that includes tree and stump removals and new planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2126.946s">New</a> section protection of landmark trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2128.889s">The</a> city shall make extra efforts to preserve landmark trees, including treating disease trees where feasible, enhancing pruning schedules and regular monitoring of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2136.58s">A</a> landmark tree shall not be cut down or removed without a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2139.745s">We</a> are close to the end here under enforcement and penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2144.434s">Two</a> sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2145.514s">Section</a> A, citizen removal of a public tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2148.215s">Any</a> person or entity damaging or removing a public tree without authority will be fined, and the fines will be deposited in the tree fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2153.937s">Enforcement</a> shall be by the tree warden or the tree warden's designee or the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2158.018s">Citizens</a> may report damage or removal of public trees to the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2161.9s">Section</a> B, penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2163.462s">Any</a> person who violates any section of this ordinance or violates any stipulation of a permit issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be fined and the fine shall consist of the cost of compensating the city for the cost of replacing the canopy that was lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2174.005s">This</a> compensation shall be calculated by measuring the canopy cover used using recent aerial photography such as Google Maps cover coverage or aerial photography, determining the number <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2183.442s">of</a> young trees that would have the equivalent canopy coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2186.325s">The</a> fine shall be the sum of the cost of preparing the site, planting those young trees at the current contract rate, and salaries and costs for staff time for selecting, watering, and monitoring those trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2195.737s">So</a> that is all of the additions and changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2202.917s">Do</a> we want to have staff?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2744.11s">I</a> just figured before we leave this one, it sounds like we want this to go to department heads for their feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2752.678s">Do</a> we want to wait and have that feedback first before we send it to KPLI? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2757.322s">I</a> assume we do, because there might be some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2759.604s">Do</a> we want to have a cost analysis done? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2762.607s">Or</a> should we have those? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2766.01s">I</a> just want to have a better sense of our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2770.865s">what</a> the different steps are that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2772.867s">Because</a> I think a cost analysis was mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2775.71s">KP</a> Law, I think, as the last step.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3470.759s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3472.061s">So</a> again, the purpose of this is to protect specified trees on private property in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3480.793s">I</a> will just go through some of the changes that have been made since the last draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3486.219s">In</a> the intent and purpose, it does add a last sentence to the first paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3489.34s">Medford's</a> current tree canopy stands at 29%. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3492.821s">Protecting</a> and increasing trees on private property is one way to protect tree canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3497.423s">No</a> trees shall be removed except in accordance with this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3501.084s">And</a> then there's another added paragraph similar to the public tree ordinance saying state legislature has granted municipalities the right and responsibility, blah, blah, blah, and quoting MGL chapter 40A. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3515.455s">There</a> are some changes in the definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3518.757s">Under</a> Caliper, again, some changes similar to those in the public tree ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3525.239s">Definition</a> of certified arborist, a professional arborist possessing current certification issued by the International Society of Arboriculture and or the Massachusetts Arborist Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3537.484s">Definition</a> for code enforcement officer, the building commissioner or designee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3541.926s">Definition</a> for construction construction permit, a building permit issued by the building department allowing construction demolition or renovation of buildings and structures on a parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3550.783s">Some</a> tiny changes to definition of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3553.505s">A</a> new definition for critical root zone, the minimum area beneath the canopy of a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3564.853s">The</a> critical root zone is represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk and extending outward towards the tree's dripline. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3575.38s">Small</a> changes to demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3577.642s">More</a> changes to the diameter at breast height, which are similar to those in the public preordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3583.945s">Definition</a> for developer, an individual or firm who purchases a property in order to improve, renovate, expand or demolish a structure with the purpose of reselling the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3594.31s">Again,</a> the definition of drip line, same as from the public preordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3601.207s">Some</a> small changes to the definition of a hazardous tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3605.151s">Definition</a> of a landmark tree, which is the same, I believe, as from the public one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3612.098s">Definition</a> of landscape design plan, a written description and scale drawing of the future site that includes the locations of plantings, structures, hardscape, green space, topography, and future canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3623.328s">A</a> handwritten drawing is acceptable accompanied by photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3628.821s">small</a> changes to the definition of Medford Tree Committee and person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3633.764s">Protected</a> tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3634.944s">Any</a> tree on private property with a diameter at breast height of eight inches or more, or a multi-stem tree having an aggregate of 24 inches or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3644.989s">Species</a> that have a small height at maturity or are slow growing, such as flowering dogwood or American holly, with a DBH of six inches or more are eligible to be considered protected trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3653.934s">Trees</a> listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3657.095s">Plants</a> list are not considered protected trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3659.616s">A</a> few changes to the definition of replacement trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3667.079s">The</a> trees must be a minimum of three inch caliber and a minimum height of six feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3672.334s">It</a> again mentions the tree fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3675.976s">It</a> has tree protection, replacement and mitigation plan, a site plan drawn and stamped by a certified land surveyor or engineer and stamped by a certified arborist or landscape architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3685.721s">It</a> must show all protected trees as defined herein, including public shade trees near the property and must indicate which protected trees will be retained or removed and how critical root zones of each protected tree and public shade tree will be protected from damage during site work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3701.5s">Tree</a> removal application process and forms required to be used by any person as defined here in seeking to remove a protected tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3709.392s">The</a> $100 fee must accompany the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3712.036s">The</a> fee will be $35 for owner occupied properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3716.602s">Tree</a> removal permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3718.499s">a</a> permit issued by the building department for removal of trees based on the appropriate application process on privately owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3724.063s">In</a> addition to the actual cutting down of living trees, quote, removal includes any act that A, has caused a protected tree to die within the previous 12 months, or B, is likely to cause significant decline or death within a three year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3738.354s">One</a> sentence added to tree warden, the duties of the tree warden are redefined in this ordinance to include private trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3746.125s">And</a> then there are a lot of additions here under applicability. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3754.254s">These</a> versions shall apply to the following activities on privately owned land. <a

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3995.117s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3995.497s">I</a> think that at this meeting, we're really kind of getting back up to speed with like what the purpose of this is, what some of the ideas are in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4005.003s">It</a> sounds like it does need some, you know, discussion with the building department of, you know, what we can and can't do, maybe some understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4018.041s">how</a> this can be covered by zoning and the building department, which I myself don't fully understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4027.204s">And</a> I'm curious about other cities, how they deal with this from a zoning perspective and a building department perspective to see how that is done in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4038.828s">So</a> I'd be interested in understanding a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4046.556s">I'm</a> hoping that the next step might be to have a sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4049.377s">I'm</a> happy to be involved with the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4054.038s">And</a> I know Trees Medford has been incredibly generous with their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4057.638s">And</a> maybe we can all sit down and have an understanding, look at some other cities, discuss what's gonna be possible here in Medford as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4240.479s">I</a> just wanted to quick ask if at this stage, is there anything that we would want to ask of Innocent Associates in terms of their, you know, like, can they give us like a very general sense of like what people do in terms of zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4258.038s">And</a> without even sending them this whole piece of paper, but maybe with the purpose of it and just say, hey, what do you recommend in terms of zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4269.347s">Or</a> how would this piece fit into zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4271.869s">Or</a> if we're too early for that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4348.056s">I</a> was just going to make a motion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4352.839s">I</a> move that Vice President Collins and I work with Therese Medford and the staff to do a next draft and update of this that we will then bring back to Council.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1930.14s">I'm</a> still on, how nice, how convenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1933.485s">Given</a> Councilor Tseng's suggestion, I wonder if there is a way to not tie it to $750. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1942.668s">I</a> wonder how we can, if there's a way to sort of craft some language that isn't gonna require us every couple of years to be like, well, that's not 750.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2439.052s">Yeah,</a> so this is a little bit of an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2440.473s">I</a> know when we first drafted the, I think we came up with nine different ones we were hoping to do, you know, this year or so, we wanted to take advantage of our community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2453.883s">So</a> we split those up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2455.244s">I</a> have a couple of reports back from those that will be upcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2460.508s">Hopefully,</a> we also can move. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2462.288s">I</a> think the senior center is fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2464.349s">We</a> also had, I think, tough students in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2468.85s">And</a> I would love for us to, at some point in the new year, to start doing things at each of the schools for parents of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2477.971s">I</a> think that's a great way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2479.231s">And</a> there's other ways for us to really get into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2482.292s">I</a> think getting out of this chamber and getting into places where folks who maybe don't come to this <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2489.073s">room</a> able to hear from more folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2493.821s">So</a> my two updates are that this Saturday through the <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2501.483s">um,</a> Arab speaking, uh, liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2504.065s">Uh,</a> we're gonna do one at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2507.108s">So</a> that's coming up Saturday at noon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2509.73s">And</a> then, um, we have two potential dates for doing one through, uh, Stacey Moore, and we decided to do it at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2518.998s">Um,</a> and the two potential dates for that are, um, Saturday, December 7th at 10 or 10.30 a.m., and Saturday, January 4th at 10 or 10.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2527.325s">So</a> we can pick either one of those, and then I can get back to her.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2577.91s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2578.31s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2578.911s">Um,</a> I would like us to choose now, like sure.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2707.512s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2707.893s">We</a> have a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2711.634s">I</a> know I mentioned, you know, maybe doing some at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2715.155s">I</a> also thought just thought we could have like a couple minutes of brainstorm since we're nearing the end of the <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2724.033s">year.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2726.514s">But,</a> you know, I think for parents at the schools, you know, one each at each school might be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2734.055s">What</a> do you think of maybe looking at where the lower income Medford residents are and trying to do like neighborhood ones where we flyer? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2744.478s">Just</a> trying to think of like, how can we reach the folks who are like, likely to come here that we don't often hear from and that we would really like to make sure that they're doing okay.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1130.82s">Any</a> thoughts of like planting a tree in the south side so that eventually it will shade that area as well if that's something that we think is necessary long-term? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1142.986s">I</a> know it's not in this project, but I just thought I would mention it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1304.039s">Just</a> one other comment that I really appreciate how much, I'm always impressed with how much our city administration looks for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1312.723s">And</a> just so that people know, grants often come with this kind of requirement where there's the grant, but then they also require the city to put in funds that are sort of roughly equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1323.527s">So</a> I really appreciate the work on that front.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=967.261s">Yeah,</a> thanks to reply. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=968.262s">So</a> what it what this always was even from the beginning was to disallow any future city council from voting to increase their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=979.518s">And</a> then in addition, I had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=983.953s">put</a> on the agenda to discuss whether the future would have a color adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=989.415s">But,</a> you know, as I was discussing them with this with some of my volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=994.016s">Somebody</a> brought up the point that that really doesn't belong in an ordinance, it's not in the other cities ordinances, that would simply be up to city Councilors to bring that up as something if they feel like bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1005.24s">So</a> the important meat and potatoes of this was always what I have here, which is making it no longer legal for city councilors to increase their own salaries, but simply to vote to increase the salary of a future city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1018.891s">That's</a> always what this was about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1020.572s">And</a> I simply removed the part that really shouldn't be part of an ordinance, but would be at the discretion of city councilors in the future.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1254.482s">I'm</a> sorry, I have to comment here because I am really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1258.985s">I</a> brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1262.767s">I'm</a> supposed to speak to the chair, because I literally was trying to appeal to I think the people who are here because of misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1274.373s">I</a> brought this up because I wanted to make sure that the city council could never again vote for their own raises that is what this was always about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1283.109s">It</a> did absolutely not suggest that we have coal increases every year or anything of the kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1290.792s">If</a> you read the original that I wrote, and look, I can understand if some people read it very quickly and did not understand what that said, but the only thing that it mandated is that no future city council could ever vote to increase their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1311.055s">So</a> I will say that I am feeling surprised that I am trying to bring forward things that I believe the people who are here would genuinely want to be passed, genuinely. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1325.441s">And</a> yet somehow, the part that said like, hey, maybe it should be like, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1335.111s">on</a> an agenda to consider, which does not mean that it should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1339.134s">Like,</a> that is the thing people focused on instead of focusing on the only actual thing that it did, which is to make sure no city council could ever vote for their own raises, and I'm surprised that Councilor Scarpelli wants a future city council to vote for their own raises to be able to raise their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1355.967s">This</a> is the only thing that it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1357.808s">So,</a> I'm... <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1361.711s">I</a> am surprised and I hope that people will read what is actually being proposed instead of making assumptions based on who is putting something forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1372.616s">What</a> does it say? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1379.979s">That's</a> what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1380.44s">I</a> mean, read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1381.48s">It</a> says no city council, no change in the salary
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1772.487s">I</a> hope that people can discuss what is on here with the removal of that second half of the thing because this is the only thing that is being proposed.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4006.613s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4012.074s">I</a> brought this up and I apologize for having anything about COLA in it at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4020.155s">I</a> wish that it had been this second version, which almost no one talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4027.477s">I</a> brought this up knowing that it would not be friendly <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4036.892s">to</a> many of my fellow city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4041.613s">I</a> brought it up because I believe that it is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4045.074s">I</a> believe that city councilors, as is true in many states, and as is true in some other cities in Massachusetts, city councilors should not be able to raise their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4056.637s">That</a> is why I brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4059.778s">I</a> brought it up despite knowing that other city councilors here <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4065.865s">who</a> voted yes, when I voted no against those raises earlier this year, that those other city councilors might have their feelings hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4073.947s">They</a> might feel that this was not friendly to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4082.169s">I</a> felt a little ballsy and I felt that I was doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4096.405s">I</a> still feel that I'm doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4097.806s">And</a> I don't mind being ballsy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4100.407s">I'm</a> just a little bit sad that I am attacked not for what is actually what I am, this, what I am proposing today, which I believe if it had been put forward by councilor, that every person in this room who spoke out against it would be speaking out in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4122.1s">Now,</a> maybe I am wrong, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4126.158s">Wow,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4127.578s">I</a> should not have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4128.539s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4129.399s">I</a> don't want to put words in anyone's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4131.379s">I</a> am very sorry.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4136.34s">I</a> genuinely was trying to do what I believed and continue to believe is the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4143.422s">And</a> I do hope that things like this can be read <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4156.665s">and</a> spoken about with some attempt at understanding that it is a good faith effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4165.631s">And</a> literally what is written here and what I am trying to do is to make it not possible for the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4176.417s">to</a> raise salaries of any sitting elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4181.199s">I</a> believe that is what I personally believe in, and I will stand by it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4949.994s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4950.775s">Six</a> or eight months ago we had these. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4957.159s">So</a> engineer own we're Tella and the Commissioner Tim McGivern at the public works meeting, and it was great to sort of be able to get their take on an update on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4970.628s">because</a> they will have the extra $500,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4976.071s">We</a> want to go ahead and get another update from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4979.112s">And</a> I invite everyone who's interested in our roads, which I think is everyone, I hope, I'm certainly interested in our roads, to come and have questions for them prepared so that we can get all the information that we need.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5077.688s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5078.888s">This</a> was something that I talked about a lot, as I was knocking on doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5084.57s">Last</a> summer, and I found that a lot of people were especially in South Medford we're really interested in helping to plant trees in their city I know that there are other cities that allow residents to help with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5097.833s">program.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5098.193s">Obviously,</a> it's this only with the proper training with the proper trees at the proper depth, you know, doing everything exactly the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5106.38s">It</a> sounded like as I talked to Commissioner given that he is open to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5113.245s">And</a> this is simply to have him come to a meeting and so that we can begin discussing how this might work in our city and get the sort of best ideas of the way this would move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5124.374s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5128.223s">I</a> hope that we might by spring, if spring is the right time to plant trees, that we might be able to have our first pilot program.<h2><a href="../2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M/2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M.html">City Council 10-29-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3112.782s">I</a> just wanted to note that I was actually kind of peeking through the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3118.946s">Just</a> now, definitely it specifically calls out the parking of the senior center that that must be that that must be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3130.314s">I</a> think replaced or continued at least the number of parking spaces, but it also talks about the idea that the parking that is created has to not only consider the senior center, but it also has to account for new business development in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3148.67s">So</a> I'm not saying that what's in the RFP, sorry, I'll talk to the, I'm supposed to talk to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3153.814s">I'm</a> not saying that what's in the RFP is definitely what <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3158.118s">will</a> happen in the end product. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3159.899s">But</a> I think that it just so that you know, it is in the RFP specifically that those requests are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3167.244s">And</a> then this you coming to this meeting is absolutely fantastic, because, you know, it has to come through this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3174.129s">So</a> we are now extra aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3176.81s">I</a> also would love to be in one of the future <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3181.053s">listening</a> sessions at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3184.094s">And</a> we can even specifically bring up this topic of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3188.956s">And,</a> you know, as we go forward, I think there will be other public meetings about the development that is going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3196.82s">So</a> I really appreciate all of your comments, and we will take them to heart and we will, you know, make sure to <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3202.862s">be</a> pushing forward as the RFP moves forward through the process, that we will make sure that not only are there enough spaces for the senior center, but also for the growing needs of parking in Medford Square as it grows.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3948.987s">I</a> had a thought as we were discussing this because I and I do remember going to some of those public participation community events organized by the planning department to discuss these three lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3963.391s">And</a> I, I wonder if there is something of a timing problem because you know that was <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3970.473s">At</a> least it was a year and a half ago, or over a year ago for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3974.335s">And</a> I think what may happen is that when it's so far away from a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3982.599s">People</a> might not realize that it's going to impact them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3989.163s">And</a> then when it becomes like now there's an actual RFP and it's already been sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3994.488s">And</a> so now people are worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3996.85s">So</a> I'm wondering if maybe, you know, we can have like just a chit chat with the administration and talk about maybe having, spreading the community meetings in such a way that there are some community meetings closer to <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4014.425s">or</a> like before or after an RFP goes out, because now that it's becoming a reality I think people are realizing the way that it's going to impact their lives in a way that a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4025.137s">It</a> wasn't, it didn't seem like something to attend so anyway, I'm just thinking about that as something that maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4033.826s">You</a> know, if the administration is in fact, you know, we are having these community meetings, but the timing isn't lining up with what people need in terms of it being really applicable to their lives and then wanting to take the time out to come to these community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4048.861s">So</a> I think I may just have a little, and I might talk to some folks in the administration about that possibility of changing the timing of some of those.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.182s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.423s">So</a> on page 22 of 39, I just have one question, which is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6493.809s">And</a> I just want to make sure there's not a typo in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6496.131s">I</a> really remembered, and tell me if I'm misremembering, that the height, the building height differential between MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3 was more gradual. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6506.942s">These</a> MX-1 numbers and MX-2 numbers are identical. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6509.604s">And</a> I really thought that it stepped up between MX-1 and MX-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6513.348s">Is</a> that not accurate, page 22 of 39? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6521.872s">Yeah,</a> yep, 22 of 39 of the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6526.053s">I</a> thought there was a step up between MX1 and MX2 and not like they're identical and there's a giant leap to MX3 in terms of height.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6567.487s">And</a> if I may, I also noticed that co living is explicitly denied in MX one, two and three, which is probably fine, because I'm guessing that those are all going to be one and two bedroom places that are built there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6585.736s">But</a> just a note.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7166.807s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7167.467s">I</a> just have three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7170.208s">My</a> first question is at these times in the past, did they have other cost of living adjustments or raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7176.649s">Or</a> are these the only ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7179.27s">And</a> my second question is just about parking union titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7183.671s">Does</a> this include everyone in the department? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7185.752s">I</a> just want to understand what parking union titles means, and I understand that it's part of contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7195.914s">I</a> mean, my third question is a little more broad, probably not really able to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7204.957s">So</a> I assume that the reason that we're looking only at raising parking right now is because of union negotiations rather than raising salaries of other unions.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7986.922s">You</a> don't you don't touch the cemetery soil removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7991.585s">You</a> know, I saw this on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7992.466s">And</a> I was assuming that was part of the Halloween zombie uprising initiative.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8003.334s">But</a> I thought it was part of the whole business from Tim McGivern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8006.556s">Halloween</a> Zombie Uprising Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.159s">Sorry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.86s">The</a> Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8013.062s">You're</a> making me say it four times.

<a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=435.27s">Why</a> are we trying to increase sexism? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=439.495s">And</a> so the basic question is really, do we have enough money to do the services in our city that we want, that we really are expecting from anyone that lives in any city in Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=452.904s">So</a> I'll start by saying that we rank 320th out of 351 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=457.307s">That's</a> the 2024 budget, in terms of our budget per capita. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=466.313s">So</a> that means we have a smaller budget per person than all of the other 58 cities, and it is smaller per person than 90% of towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=477.345s">The</a> only towns that have a smaller budget per person than we do are all much smaller than New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=483.912s">So</a> the truth is, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=486.195s">We</a> just can't run a city on the amount of money that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=490.617s">And</a> Prop 2.5, I don't know how much we're, we need to get into that specifically, but Prop 2.5 in Massachusetts means that if we're gonna raise taxes more than the total amount of taxes that we bring into the city, more than 2.5% per year, we put that on the ballot and ask the voters to make that decision, and that's what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=511.288s">The</a> other thing I want to raise now, because people ask this question a lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=516.19s">Is</a> there somewhere in our budget that we can scrimp and save? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=523.852s">This</a> giant blue piece of the pie is our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=528.473s">I</a> think everyone on both sides of this question understands that we have a huge funding gap in our schools and that we need to find more funding for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=537.315s">The</a> next one is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=538.896s">Insurance</a> is required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=541.28s">We</a> cannot, this is not discretionary, we can't cut that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=545.283s">The</a> next budget is pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=547.225s">Pensions,</a> again, are a contract, but we cannot just decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=553.312s">The</a> next two are fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=557.114s">I</a> don't think that anyone on either side of this fractured and wrapped question wants us to drastically cut our fire department or our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=566.158s">The</a> next one is DPW highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=569.22s">That</a> means our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=572.574s">And</a> the thing that's important to understand about roads is that the more you underfund them, the more money, you're ballooning the amount of debt that you have to pay later. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=584.023s">So,</a> for example, we had a road assessment done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=586.965s">It</a> has five ratings, one, two, three, four, five. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=590.805s">49%</a> of our roads fall into the worst two categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=594.587s">And</a> here's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=595.968s">It</a> costs at least 30 times as much to fix a category five road as it costs to fix a category two road. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=603.632s">So</a> if you just always fix your category two roads, and always have your roads in good condition, you can actually do it with the state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=611.797s">But</a> when you allow them, when you underfund them, and you allow them to get in such a dilapidated state, you just haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=618.14s">In</a> prior administrations, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=620.117s">You're</a> ballooning the amount of debt that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=623.118s">So</a> you can't underfront your roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=625.279s">After</a> roads is bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=628.82s">Again,</a> we have to pay that money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=631.601s">This</a> is not something that we can just decide not to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=635.262s">And</a> now we're getting into these tiny, we're not working up here in these teeny, weeny little ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=641.244s">With</a> the library, facilities, and other small departments like HR, things we simply cannot cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=648.396s">There</a> is nowhere in this budget that there's a ton of waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=653.959s">There's</a> nowhere in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=655.4s">We</a> already have, over decades, cut and cut and cut and cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=661.303s">There's</a> nowhere else to cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=662.764s">We</a> simply do not have the budget to support a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=667.406s">And</a> I would like to pass it to Mayor, if I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=669.547s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1213.174s">Okay,</a> I think I'm going to take what is free cash, and then the mayor is going to take what are the projects that are waiting in ways for free cash to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1222.384s">So,</a> free cash, dumb name, not free, not cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1226.328s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1229.249s">So</a> pre-cash is the official term for, at the end of budget season, let's say your budget was $108 million, and at the end of the budget, you spend $107 million, that $10 million difference, it's called pre-cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1244.638s">Now</a> maybe you had a little more revenue than you expected, maybe you didn't spend on something you thought you would spend on, but it's very common, and what's important to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1255.709s">is</a> that it is recommended by the state of Massachusetts that cities and towns have between 3% and 5% of their budget in free cash each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1266.978s">Now,</a> 3% to 5% of the federal budget is between $5 million and $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1271.381s">And</a> the reason it's recommended is because bond agencies <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1277.563s">will</a> give you a rating based in part, so that's one of the things they use to give you a bond rating, which is like a credit rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1284.686s">So</a> if you don't have free cash, if you end up spending every penny, which I have heard from people like, we should spend every penny, it's mismanaged, we don't spend every penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1295.331s">It's</a> actually financially mismanaged according to bond agencies and according to the state of Massachusetts if you spend every penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1302.615s">It</a> is considered that you are not being financially responsible with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1307.264s">So</a> that's the most important thing to understand is that we need to have free cash in order to have a good profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1314.347s">And</a> what else can I say about free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1316.588s">Maybe</a> the next thing is just to talk about what it gets used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1320.71s">The</a> one other thing I will say is that in 2024, we, for the first time, created a capital stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1330.534s">Now,</a> we were one of the last five municipalities out of 351, sorry, 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1337.675s">We</a> were one of the last five to create one, so we finally did that, and that's where you're supposed to put pre-cash so that it can be spent on capital projects.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1805.573s">And</a> just quickly, the city council has been working on rezoning, and we're pretty excited about this to ask, because we're gonna rezone for a lot of mixed use and a lot higher stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1817.843s">It'll</a> gradually, as it goes away from the metro squares, it'll gradually get more and more stories, but we're very excited about the amount of people who might have their, and I will also just, I will switch over to Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1828.772s">So</a> this is our, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1831.674s">This</a> is the commercial sector, new growth, and I don't know how much you can see, but the last two years have been higher new growth than any time in the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1841.243s">So</a> we really are doing better.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1889.87s">Okay,</a> we haven't actually explained Prop 2.5 fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1893.051s">Would</a> you like to start by explaining Prop 2.5? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1897.151s">Let</a> me just do Prop 2.5 and override versus a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1901.972s">So,</a> unlike almost every other state in the country, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1905.765s">where</a> city councils are allowed to raise the taxes that they determine that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1910.388s">They're</a> elected, they run on it, they either want to raise taxes or they want to not raise taxes, and then as elected officials, they make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1918.733s">In</a> Massachusetts, a statewide ballot measure passed in 1980 that said that no city or town can raise the total tax levy, total amount of money brought into the city, more than 2.5% per year.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1934.914s">New</a> growth changes the model, that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1938.395s">But</a> the point is not that they can't raise the taxes, it's simply that to raise those taxes, they put it on the ballot and they allow the voters to make that decision for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1949.52s">Even</a> the proponents of Prop 10.5 did not want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1953.101s">So</a> it used to go 30 years without ever 40 years without ever putting it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1957.523s">They</a> believed that it should be put on the ballot and the voters should decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1961.873s">Override</a> is something that you increase the total amount that the tax levy can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1971.156s">So</a> in our case, it would be $3.5 million for question 7, $4 million more for question 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1980.238s">And</a> at that point, that becomes a new tax levy, and that can be increased 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1988.712s">because</a> it has a limited, it can only be used for the thing, well, they can both only be used for what they're supposed to be for, but it's for capital projects, and once it is paid off, that tax then goes down again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2005.014s">That's</a> pretty much it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2599.155s">The</a> only thing I have to add is once you negotiate contracts with the teachers, then you have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2615.09s">I</a> don't see how that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2617.592s">And</a> how often have we cut the school budget?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4902.902s">I</a> just want to say one very quick thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4905.423s">Every</a> year, for the last 40 years, that we have not put this on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4910.684s">We</a> have not allowed our community to make these decisions for themselves.<h2><a href="../2024-10-22_IuW-bxYxNyo/2024-10-22_IuW-bxYxNyo.html">Invest in Medford!</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2668.185s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2669.727s">So,</a> I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2674.631s">And</a> as Councilor Leming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2685.001s">in</a> the amount of budget we have per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2687.623s">So</a> we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2695.39s">All</a> of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2700.154s">Our</a> budget is too small to provide the services that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2704.477s">I</a> want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2710.661s">And</a> this large blue area here is the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2715.664s">That</a> is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2719.987s">The</a> next one is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2723.369s">Insurance</a> is something that we are required to have by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2726.791s">We</a> cannot cut that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2728.132s">The</a> next one is pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2730.155s">Those</a> are contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2731.737s">We</a> cannot cut pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2733.74s">The</a> next two are our fire department and our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2737.845s">My</a> feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2746.016s">The</a> next one after police and fire is our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2749.461s">And</a> I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt it's called the road backlog 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2761.857s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2763.338s">After</a> that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2774.121s">None</a> of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2782.624s">Our</a> budget is simply too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2784.225s">I'll</a> let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2786.985s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3680.349s">Free,</a> free cash.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3693.575s">May</a> I get my two minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3696.401s">Will</a> I get my two minutes?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3699.043s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3700.763s">Free</a> cash is the term that the state uses for the money that is left over after your budget season has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3709.968s">So</a> it's the difference between what you budget, which, let's say, is $180 million, and the amount you spent, which, let's say, is $172 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3714.69s">That</a> $8 million, which is the difference, is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3722.313s">Now,</a> the state of Massachusetts has a group called the Division of Local Services, and their job is to help cities and towns become financially responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3732.523s">They</a> highly recommend that cities and towns in Massachusetts have 3 to 5% of their budget left over in free cash every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3742.867s">In</a> Medford, that amount would be between $5 million and $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3747.329s">If</a> you don't have between 3 and 5% of your budget left over in free cash, you are considered financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3753.932s">by</a> credit agencies and your bond rating goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3757.514s">Now</a> that is very bad because it changes, just like if your credit rating is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3761.715s">It</a> changes the amount that you have to spend anytime you borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3765.397s">So</a> we want to be a financially responsible city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3768.698s">So</a> having money left over in free cash, and I'm going to <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3773.02s">I</a> have another chart here because I think it's important for people to understand that this city was in the past very financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3782.868s">If</a> you notice that before 2012, we couldn't even meet our budget many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3788.472s">We</a> definitely never reached that 3% in free cash and our bond rating was terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3794.697s">So</a> it's only in recent years that we have begun to have anywhere close to the required 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3801.162s">in</a> free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3802.342s">Now</a> free cash according to the state of Massachusetts should never be used for an operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3808.284s">It</a> needs to be used for capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3810.444s">We</a> currently because of underfunding of our roads have $67 million in road debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3815.586s">We</a> have $79 million in our capital improvement plan for things that need to be done only in the next <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3821.274s">Three</a> to five years.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.995s">So</a> we cannot use free cash for something like our school budget that is absolutely verboten according to financially responsible people in the state of Massachusetts.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4994.605s">two</a> minutes councilor calvin and then councilor collins very quickly the reason that those other cities don't have as much money in free cash is because they weren't last to the table in getting a stabilization fund having a stabilization fund again is considered financially responsible <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5010.774s">Medford</a> didn't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5012.755s">There</a> are 451 cities and towns in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5016.896s">We</a> are one of the last five. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5019.317s">Only</a> five remained this year that did not have a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5023.038s">That's</a> why we have all this free cash, because we didn't have any stabilization funds.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6437.822s">Thank</a> you so much for your correction, because I do know it's 351. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6441.105s">I'm</a> surprised that I said that, but thank you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6643.482s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to speak to the question, which is, where is the money going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6648.825s">So</a> my understanding is that in that first year is when that strong encouragement to spend it on what was mentioned in the- It's a legal requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6657.368s">A</a> legal requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6658.209s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6659.069s">A</a> legal requirement to spend it on what was talked about in the ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6663.451s">But</a> what happens over time, because Prop 2.5 overrides <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6670.282s">don't</a> end, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6671.082s">They</a> sort of just mean that the total amount of the budget is increased and that will continue.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6679.567s">It</a> is a sustainable source of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6681.688s">And</a> what that means is that over time, there may be, you know, like 10 years later, 15, 20, 30 years later, it may be that that budget needs, you know, the city council should be able to spend that budget in the way that makes the most sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6696.655s">So</a> that's the reason why <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6699.036s">It's</a> a legal requirement at the beginning, but it does go into the general fund, right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8276.116s">Sure,</a> I think it's important to understand that the money from both seven and eight will go to the schools, obviously not the 500,000 for the roads, but the rest of it, and that it is the job of the school committee with the mayor and with the school superintendent and the financial people and the whole administration of the schools to figure out how best to serve children with that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8305.484s">It's</a> possible that a tiny percentage of that may be necessary to boost our busing so that young kids are not walking across dangerous intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8318.456s">And</a> I'm not going to be making that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8321.059s">That's</a> simply a tiny example since people have mentioned busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8327.725s">a</a> zillion different decisions that can be made when you're talking about the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8333.008s">And</a> it's the job of that part of the electeds and administration, the school committee, as well as the administration of the school system to make the best decisions each year, given what is happening that year with the budget that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8349.859s">And</a> of course, as always, with the best interests of the students in mind.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8992.506s">That's</a> a tough question to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8994.047s">I</a> simply want to say that chronic underfunding, unfortunately, causes people to mistrust their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9002.709s">So,</a> you know, half of our roads are in the worst two road conditions, and that's from chronic underfunding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9011.692s">It</a> costs between 30 and 50 times as much to fix a road in condition five, that's the worst one, as it does to fix a road in condition two, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9022.864s">And,</a> you know, we would be able to pay every year for all of our roads to get repaired with chapter 90 funding if we never let them fall into that kind of disrepair, but through underfunding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9035.97s">chronic</a> decades long underfunding, we have created a city that cannot service basic, basic needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9043.576s">And</a> that does make people mistrust the government, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9046.918s">But</a> the fix is, and someone here mentioned, you know, that what other communities do when they're in these situations is bonds and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9056.905s">I</a> think that what other communities do in this situation is they pass a prop two and a half override.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10290.473s">Thanks</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10291.554s">Always</a> good to see young folks coming up here and asking these great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10297.496s">So</a> I just want to talk a little bit about the difference between 7 and 8, Proposition 7, Proposition 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10306.04s">And</a> 7 is going to make sure that we provide the same resources and the same <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10312.486s">you</a> know, budget, basically, that we have been providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10317.33s">Prop</a> eight is gonna be where we make sure that we can actually really do a little bit more, that we can take care of our teachers, that we can pay them better salaries, that we can pay paras better salaries, that we take care of them the way that they are taking care of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10336.086s">So</a> that's just a little bit about the difference between those two and why they're separate.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10343.295s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.268s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.768s">And</a> again, these questions are better answered by school committee folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10861.129s">My</a> understanding is that you can't really compare what our entire school budget is to other cities very well, because other cities don't include a lot of the things that we include in the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10872.911s">So</a> it's not apples to apples. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10874.991s">And</a> I wish I could rattle off all the things that are included and not included. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10878.792s">The</a> ones that I recall are, I think, IT, and now because of <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10883.661s">post</a> COVID, there's just a lot more, you know, Chromebooks required for students and other IT related things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10890.563s">IT</a> is often not included in school budgets in other cities, but it is included in our school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10895.544s">I</a> think there are parts of building maintenance that are included in our school budget that are not included in other city school budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10901.326s">So</a> while it appears, if you just look at the number, it appears that we spend more per student, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10909.005s">I</a> don't believe that that is an accurate way of looking at it simply because of the things that are and aren't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10914.67s">And</a> then I just wanted to comment about the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10918.253s">Unless</a> I'm mistaken, please correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10921.216s">We</a> have one of the shortest school days of anywhere in the entire state that we are barely like a minute or two above the state absolute minimum for the number of minutes that children have to spend in school across the entire year.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12169.994s">Just</a> a super quick comment that teachers who are underpaid compared to how much they could make in other cities, they do think about whether the city is able to fund them the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12182.738s">So</a> if we want people to stay, it's just healthier for us in terms of teacher morale and longevity to have, for them to know that the budget is there for their salaries for the next year, because people do try to think ahead <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12200.057s">you</a> know, they're less, we'll just have more turnover, that's all, thanks.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12846.367s">Yeah,</a> I just um, so my understanding is that there are some numbers going around comparing Medford salaries with communities like Arlington, but actually just have an accurate numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12858.497s">And,</a> and those are all public so you can actually go on the web and like look up those numbers so I encourage you to do that just to make sure that the numbers that you're seeing are accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12865.783s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.305s">I</a> love that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.966s">Thank</a> you so much for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13931.529s">I</a> think there are a few basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13935.354s">I</a> don't want to say rules of engagement, but just pieces of advice that people hopefully understand as like good for group dynamics healthy for a community healthy for a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13947.177s">I</a> hope that people in their conversations with neighbors can think about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13951.123s">I</a> hope that we on the council can also do these things as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13954.247s">They</a> are things like treat other people with respect and dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13960.815s">Assume</a> good intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13963.431s">Don't</a> assume that the other person means you ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13967.312s">Just</a> assume that they have good intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13969.992s">Listen</a> to what folks are actually saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13974.953s">Don't</a> use accusational language. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13978.754s">Basic</a> decorum, basic showing respect for other people is what I encourage for everyone in all of their discussions with the friends, family, neighbors, city councilors, and all of those folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13991.801s">And</a> I hope that if I am not following that, people will call me out, because I do hope that I can always treat everyone, no matter what their political position on a topic is, with respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14007.644s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-13_KoLJRazKApc/2024-10-13_KoLJRazKApc.html">Why we can't use Free Cash to fund our budget</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=0.031s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=3.453s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=4.293s">I</a> wanted to take this opportunity to answer a question that has come up pretty often in these chambers, and that really is a question about why we can't use free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=15.479s">People</a> say that they heard that we have $34 million in free cash, and why can't we use that instead of raising taxes, which I think is a very fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=23.944s">And</a> I would like people to consider <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=26.145s">the</a> way that city budgets and city finances are similar to household finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=32.751s">When</a> you run a household, you've got income, you've got expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=35.714s">If</a> you make your operating budget, your normal budget for the year, you want to look at your income and hope that your budget adds up to less than your total income. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=44.822s">And</a> in your household, you probably also have <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=47.384s">a</a> savings account. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=49.147s">It's</a> good to have a savings account for one time or unexpected expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=53.414s">Your</a> kid might need braces, your roof might need repair, you might need to get a new car. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=58.225s">Cities</a> also need to have savings accounts for similar reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=61.227s">At</a> some point, we will need a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=63.349s">We</a> will need a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=64.85s">There</a> might be a pandemic, and our schools suddenly need HVAC systems to all be replaced at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=70.154s">The</a> short answer to why we should not use free cash for normal budgeted items is that free cash is savings, and we need it to fix things that are getting older, like buildings or firetrucks, or in case some unexpected emergency happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=84.184s">Now</a> what is free cash exactly? <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=87.285s">It</a> is really a dumb name because it's not free and it's not cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=91.346s">Every</a> year the city makes a budget and throughout the year we spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=95.607s">If</a> we spend less than we budgeted, that amount left over is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=100.708s">So</a> if we budget $180 million and then we spend $172 million, that gives us $8 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=107.729s">And</a> what's important to understand is that every city is strongly encouraged by the state to have free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=114.335s">Cities</a> must spend less than their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=116.878s">If</a> they spend more than their budget, their bond rating goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=119.72s">Bond</a> rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=120.301s">It's</a> like a credit rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=121.522s">And</a> if your bond rating goes down, then it costs you an arm and a leg in interest and fees to borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=127.089s">Spending</a> more than you budgeted is a big no-no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=129.069s">It's</a> a sign that your city's being poorly run. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=131.87s">So</a> yay for Medford that recently we have free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=134.971s">This</a> has raised our bond rating up to a double A plus rating in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=140.012s">The</a> Division of Local Services is a state body that helps cities and towns be financially responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=145.633s">It</a> recommends that cities and towns have between three and 5% of their total budget in free cash every year to maintain a good bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=153.275s">And</a> in Medford, that is between 5 million and 9 million each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=157.677s">Our</a> $34 million in certified free cash is primarily because we had $9 million in 2023 due to remaining ARPA COVID grant funds, $9 million in 2022 because of unfilled state positions and legal funds not being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=172.151s">Both</a> of these years are within the recommended 3-5% of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=178.642s">Before</a> about 2012, we had almost no free cash each year, which really is a sign of not being managed, financially managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=189.086s">And</a> the state recommends that municipalities create what are called stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=196.166s">Almost</a> every city and town at the start of 2024, all but four cities and towns out of 351 had at least one stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=207.091s">We</a> were one of only four that did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=209.592s">We</a> finally, this year, have created two stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=216.462s">And</a> what's important to remember, do not use your savings, free cash or stabilization funds for normal operating expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=222.705s">The</a> Division of Local Services says, quote, free cash should be restricted to paying one-time expenditures, funding capital projects, or replenishing other reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=231.909s">It</a> recommends that communities adopt a free cash policy that avoids supplementing current year departmental operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=242.995s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=244.545s">We</a> are recommended by the state to have a certain amount of money in our stabilization funds for Medford, it's five to 7%, which is what they recommend would be between nine and $13 million in our stabilization in our general stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=264.59s">Just</a> to understand a little bit about what we might use these stabilization funds or free cash for, we do have, according to our payment analysis, $67 million in essentially road debt, because we have not kept our roads up as much as we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=285.456s">It</a> costs less. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=287.239s">each</a> year if your roads are in good shape, and it costs if your roads are in bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=291.483s">So</a> we need to make sure that we are doing those improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=295.146s">And</a> then we also have a capital improvement plan, which has recognized $79 million in needs from about 123 projects across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=307.356s">So</a> I just want to be pretty clear that when you look at what we are recommended to do by the state in order to be a financially responsible city, that means that we should continue to create a budget that we know we won't exceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=324.859s">At</a> the end of each fiscal year, we should have between 3% and 5% of that total budget unspent, which is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=332.001s">Those</a> funds can move into a stabilization <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=335.068s">where</a> we can spend them to properly take care of our city, which will allow us to spend less in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=343.253s">And</a> of course, we also want to have new growth through more commercial growth and new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=348.256s">We</a> already are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=349.237s">The</a> last three years have seen Medford's highest new growth in the past two decades, and we will continue to encourage new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=355.22s">Unfortunately,</a> this is a slow process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=357.362s">It</a> cannot fix our budget shortfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=359.723s">and</a> because of rising costs of schools, insurance, pensions, inflation affecting every department and other costs that we cannot control, we need to increase our annual budget and that means voting yes on the overrides and on the debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=373.015s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KoLJRazKApc&t=376.022s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-10_m5uYjUemjGA/2024-10-10_m5uYjUemjGA.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 10-09-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=618.988s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=620.349s">So,</a> in looking over these I had a few comments, starting with the co housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=625.013s">I</a> think that definition is pretty good, but if you look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=630.017s">So,</a> in Cambridge there are two different co housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=636.041s">places.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=637.102s">One</a> of them is more like townhouses, and the other one is more larger buildings, a little bit more like apartment buildings, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=648.986s">And</a> so I would want to, like, I think the definition of co-housing hopefully should not limit it to small single unit or two unit buildings, but rather be a building or set of buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=666.36s">just</a> to open it up a little bit in case people want to basically build co-housing that's a little bit more like an apartment building but has a bunch of shared facilities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=677.205s">My</a> second one is about co-living and I think what I'm hoping to do is to make a distinction between co-living and which is tenants choosing to live with each other as something we specifically want to <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=697.271s">allow</a> and encourage in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=699.813s">And</a> there's also something else that I think we specifically want to discourage in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=704.755s">And</a> the difference is really whether the tenants select who the other tenants are, or whether the landlord selects the tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=712.92s">So</a> for example, I did a slight update to the co-living. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=719.11s">saying</a> a building in which a group of residents pay rent to occupy a single unit with private bedrooms and shared living spaces, including cooking and sanitary facilities, such residents have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=733.397s">And</a> I have a little bit of extra language in case it's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=735.979s">I</a> don't know whether it's necessary, but the end of that sentence could be either because they apply for the lease jointly or because when one or more tenants moves out, the residents jointly select a new tenant to add to the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=748.854s">I</a> think that the concept that residents have input over the selection of the other residents is important in co-living. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=759.0s">And</a> then the one I would want to discourage is basically the same, but saying residents of this other thing, which I don't know what the name would be, do not have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=818.149s">You</a> say a group of residents pay to rent, pay rent to occupy a single unit.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=839.878s">Great</a> and I would love that that'd be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=843.061s">I</a> think that's most of my, my, my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=848.847s">I</a> did notice when I was looking through the definition, the definition of like a lodger, and of a lodging house. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=857.765s">To</a> me the definition of a lodger was not clear but apparently it is pretty clear because you know to the staff because they have been dealing with this code for you know this zoning for you know many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=868.058s">They</a> understand what it means which maybe is plenty and that's all we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=874.162s">I</a> thought that lodger and lodging house were related to each other, which apparently they really aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=880.186s">I</a> think the lodging house definition is slightly problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=886.39s">Let</a> me just find, sorry if I can find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=895.495s">Oh,</a> my other comment about congregate living is I don't know that we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=899.016s">I</a> know that elderly-oriented congregate living, we have a lot of senior housing definitions already in our zoning, so I'm not sure that having an elderly-oriented congregate housing would conflict with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=919.34s">Yeah,</a> I'll leave it there, thanks.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1569.559s">That's</a> your calling? <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1573.161s">I</a> don't think we need a motion at this point because NS and associates is going to take this feedback and bring it back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1578.404s">Is</a> that accurate?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1658.645s">My</a> only question is <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1662.751s">I</a> sent an email with the language that I had suggested, which doesn't have to be exact, but is there anything else that we should do with this language or will Innocence Associates come back to us with these updates?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2364.158s">Hello,</a> sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2365.258s">I'm</a> not at my desk anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2367.779s">Yeah,</a> so this, the northernmost commercial lot on the south side of the street, the sort of easternmost, just wondering about that being commercial as opposed to one of the mixed use, just because it does abut right up to the public housing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2638.188s">I</a> was just gonna want, out of my curiosity, like, is there a reason why this, because it seems like we have a distinction between these two, and like it would make more sense to the I if this was commercial than that was commercial? <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2649.618s">Like</a> just, you know, is there a reason why? <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2652.42s">Is</a> it because of the size of the lots, or is there some reason why this is, excuse, and that's commercial instead of switching those?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4090.404s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4091.765s">Just</a> super quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4092.966s">We</a> still are intending to have a co-working definition added. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4096.829s">Since</a> it was mentioned that like a co-working space, I just wanted to double check.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4178.96s">All</a> I know is that when I was doing some research into it, it seemed like co-working spaces had difficulty finding an appropriate place within zoning in most cities, and I don't remember exactly why. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4189.066s">I'm</a> looking to see if I can find why. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4190.887s">I</a> might be able to find it in about one minute.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4306.955s">Thank</a> you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4307.515s">Councilor</a> Callahan, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4308.812s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4309.553s">And</a> just to close up that thought I found the whole thread that I had run into before, and they are in fact talking about the fact that a lot of co working spaces want to be in retail, where there's zone for retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4321.746s">And</a> they don't want to be shunted off into like commercial office space zones because it doesn't really work for co working nobody wants to rent there if it is in that space so <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4331.463s">as</a> long as we're aiming toward, like this whole idea of mixed use, maybe, you know, it'll fit perfectly in there, but as long as that's in our minds, and I think, yes, we will wanna have co-working definitions, both to promote it, as well as to enable it to be the tiny little, in the same way that retail in our code, I don't know if we're continuing this, has different definitions for like, <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4360.087s">convenience</a> store and other kinds of stores that have different sizes, there may be usefulness to having that sort of definition for co-working so that we can have like neighborhood co-working spaces that are tiny in, you know, more across the residential neighborhoods, as well as be able to have more ones like on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4379.623s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3447.485s">Reaching</a> out through, say, if we're going through the senior center, then also being able to go through the PTOs.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1285.942s">Oh,</a> I just figured while we're getting the Zoom up, we could ask some questions.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1528.841s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1529.881s">So</a> I have one, just a question for my own curiosity, and then I also have a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1535.905s">So</a> I'm curious why the commercial is like 50% lot coverage and the other ones are 80% lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1542.849s">Is</a> that like a standard thing, and is there a reason why that's so?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1583.019s">And</a> I saw that and I'm curious about like permeable surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1586.002s">If</a> it's going to be 80% lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1588.023s">Do</a> we have a recurrent just because I know in that area, we're really concerned about it being a heat island.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1641.279s">My</a> final, oh, did you?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1712.005s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1712.726s">My</a> final kind of suggestion was, because I live down there and I'm, and I, my kid goes to the method took looking at option B. I wonder if, rather than that sort of southwestern portion being all commercial, if it's possible to split that and have commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1732.469s">Right</a> on the road and then having those back parcels be mixed use or something else not have so much of the audio auto usage close to the school and the park and also this public housing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1745.397s">So</a> having you know a little bit nicer usages right butting up to those those three would be great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2327.188s">Back,</a> you mentioned that maybe keeping that not having incentive zoning and keeping that to.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2334.177s">I</a> wasn't sure if he was asking about that, so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3150.548s">Mine</a> was actually very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3151.508s">I'm</a> just curious if it would be useful for us to have a definition of life sciences or R&D in the definitions, or if simply having a maximum height that allows for taller stories would be enough.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3549.857s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3552.159s">This</a> may not be something you guys can answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3554.08s">But,</a> um, in terms of like commercial buildings, uh, I know that ever since Covid, there's a lot less need for commercial buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3562.526s">Do</a> we still think that there is enough need that if we zone something that is purely commercial that, um <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3571.22s">people</a> going to be developing that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3656.738s">And</a> just as a follow-up question to that, given the, I guess, ongoing crash in commercial real estate, do we think, in terms of this option A or B, I just wanna get a sense for like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3679.203s">If</a> we exclude commercial, do we think that we'll be missing out on folks who want to develop here? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3683.625s">If</a> we include commercial, will we be risking having a whole zone that does not have a lot of demand? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3690.808s">Just</a> obviously, you can't fully answer this question, but do you have a sense between those two?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5985.717s">incentive</a> zoning not being in that one section, but I assume that everything else would have incentive zoning.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=863.717s">So</a> I just want to update that next sentence a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=866.159s">The</a> purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that residents do not intentionally feed wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=870.922s">I</a> don't think that's quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=871.963s">I</a> think it's more like do not feed unwanted wildlife. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=879.408s">I</a> mean, it's really the purpose is to make sure that, you know, people aren't accidentally providing food for pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=887.967s">But</a> I don't know exactly how to phrase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=892.449s">I</a> mean, I don't think anybody's intentionally feeding rodents, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=900.092s">That's</a> not a thing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1857.023s">I</a> would lean toward, I agree with putting all three of those at the top because it is a thing that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1867.847s">And</a> then I would put ordinances, the definition of ordinance down with the commonly used terms and keep it out of that one line. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1876.405s">the</a> top. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1876.745s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1882.827s">Um</a> well, I would remove motion the previous, I can't see it cuz it's covered by the.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1898.75s">I</a> suspect that for people who are, you know, coming to their first city council meeting or something, that is not a thing they need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1907.551s">I</a> would just take that one out because I don't think it's like super important to know that one motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1913.035s">There's</a> other stuff that we could put in there in terms of commonly used terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1916.577s">I</a> would rather see ordinance than that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1919.519s">That's</a> what I would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1920.14s">I</a> would remove that one and put in ordinance.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2242.5s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2243.36s">I</a> don't think that what Councilor Lazzaro was saying was that this is going to be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2249.043s">I</a> think that there are different people who understand things in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2253.525s">And</a> I completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2254.486s">I</a> think this is fantastic for what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2256.627s">I</a> love the idea of laminated copies being in this room for people to just like maybe on every row, there's a copy and people can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2265.772s">And</a> I would love to offer to work with Councilor Lazzaro on the apples and worms version.<h2><a href="../2024-09-18_k65YPGeaIcs/2024-09-18_k65YPGeaIcs.html">City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee 09-17-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1677.967s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1679.068s">So</a> currently those fees, I assume they are associated with not just rodent control, right, that you have to have themsters and that seems like a normal <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1689.207s">fee</a> for any kind of construction that is not solely for rodent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1693.35s">Are</a> those fees going into the general fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1696.412s">Are</a> we, I mean, I don't know how large this is and if there will be some pushback from other parts of the administration that, you know, these fees really are not just for rodent control and perhaps should be going to the general budget.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2503.039s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-09-18_9UBBIuMHGIQ/2024-09-18_9UBBIuMHGIQ.html">City Council 09-17-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2181.749s">I</a> would like to suggest that we consider giving the weekend hours to one, perhaps not the during the week, as sort of matching with with during the week is just till midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2197.815s">Yes,</a> but during the week is till midnight, which is later than they're currently are, which was 11pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2202.057s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2203.542s">believe</a> so yes yes so that is what I'm suggesting that it be weekend till one during the week till 11 but a little bit of a compromise on that point I don't I also don't particularly see a reason why consistency is the reason why we should agree or not agree I think you know <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2224.141s">different</a> businesses are in different areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2226.323s">They</a> have neighbors closer or farther away from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2228.965s">They</a> have different track records of complaints with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2233.228s">I</a> think it's pretty clear that Panda Express has all of those check boxes that we want to see in terms of being pretty distant from the closest housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2245.978s">But</a> I think there could be some consideration to a possibility of giving them the extended hours for the weekend <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2254.693s">for</a> this vote.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2852.357s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2853.557s">Yeah,</a> I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2855.238s">It</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2856.478s">I</a> also agree that, you know, we have to be aware of costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2860.379s">I</a> simply wanted to add that after I had my son, I remember traveling around and talking to all the other new moms about where you could possibly change a baby in the bathroom without laying them on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2871.003s">So</a> I hope that we can include that in the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2873.503s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3245.339s">I</a> just, I hope that we are infrequently asked to waive three readings and that we can- There's not three readings on this paper.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3262.245s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3263.926s">As</a> a general rule, I hope that we are infrequently asked to make quick decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3270.632s">Apparently</a> this is not waiving three readings, so maybe it is not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3274.354s">But</a> just wanted to make that short comment.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3421.155s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3421.996s">I</a> wanted to take this opportunity to answer a question that has come up pretty often in these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3427.661s">And</a> that really is a question about why we can't use free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3433.166s">People</a> say that they heard that we have $34 million in free cash and why can't we use that instead of raising taxes, which I think is a very fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3441.653s">And</a> I would like people to consider the way that city budgets and city finances are similar to household finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3450.456s">When</a> you run a household, you've got income, you've got expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3453.397s">If</a> you make your operating budget, your normal budget for the year, you want to look at your income and hope that your budget adds up to less than your total income. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3462.52s">And</a> in your household, you probably also have a savings account. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3466.85s">It's</a> good to have a savings account for one time or unexpected expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3471.113s">Your</a> kid might need braces, your roof might need repair, you might need to get a new car. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3475.916s">Cities</a> also need to have savings accounts for similar reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3478.925s">At</a> some point, we will need a new fire station, we'll need a new high school, there might be a pandemic and our schools suddenly need HVAC systems to all be replaced at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3487.873s">The</a> short answer to why we should not use free cash for normal budgeted items is that free cash is savings, and we need it to fix things that are getting older, like buildings or fire trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3498.328s">or</a> in case some unexpected emergency happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3501.889s">Now,</a> what is free cash exactly? <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3504.991s">It</a> is really a dumb name because it's not free and it's not cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3509.032s">Every</a> year, the city makes a budget and then throughout the year, we spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3513.314s">If</a> we spend less than we budgeted, that amount left over is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3518.416s">So</a> if we budget $180 million and then we spend $172 million, that gives us $8 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3525.439s">And</a> what's important to understand is that every city is strongly encouraged by the state to have free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3532.021s">Cities</a> must spend less than their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3534.581s">If</a> they spend more than their budget, their bond rating goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3537.422s">Bond</a> rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3538.002s">It's</a> like a credit rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3539.203s">And</a> if your bond rating goes down, then it costs you an arm and a leg in interest and fees to borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3544.784s">Spending</a> more than you budgeted is a big no-no. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3546.784s">It's</a> a sign that your city is being poorly run. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3549.597s">So</a> yay for Medford that recently we have free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3552.681s">This</a> has raised our bond rating up to a double A plus rating last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3557.666s">The</a> division of local services is a state body that helps cities and towns be financially responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3563.331s">It</a> recommends cities and towns have between three and 5% of their total budget and free cash every year to maintain a good bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3570.979s">And</a> in Medford, that is between 5 million and 9 million each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3575.383s">Our</a> $34 million in certified free cash is primarily because we had $9 million in 2023 due to remaining ARPA COVID grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3585.309s">9</a> million in 2022 because of unfilled state positions and legal funds not being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3589.831s">Both</a> of these years are within the recommended three to 5% of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3596.355s">Before</a> about 2012, we had almost no free cash each year, which really is a sign of not being managed, financially managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3606.78s">And</a> the state recommends that municipalities create what are called stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3613.877s">Almost</a> every city and town at the start of 2024, all but four cities and towns out of 351 had at least one stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3624.808s">We</a> were one of only four that did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3627.33s">We</a> finally, this year, have created two stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3634.147s">And</a> what's important to remember, do not use your savings, free cash or stabilization funds for normal operating expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3640.391s">The</a> division of local services says, quote, free cash should be restricted to paying one-time expenditures, funding capital projects or replenishing other reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3649.617s">It</a> recommends that communities adopt a free cash policy that avoids supplementing current year departmental operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3660.705s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3662.236s">We</a> are recommended by the state to have a certain amount of money in our stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3668.061s">For</a> Medford, it's five to 7%, which is what they recommend would be between nine and $13 million in our general stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3680.913s">And</a> just to understand a little bit about what we might use these stabilization funds <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3687.85s">or</a> free cash for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3689.692s">We</a> do have, according to our payment analysis, $67 million in essentially road debt because we have not kept our roads up as much as we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3703.186s">It</a> costs less. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3704.932s">Each</a> year, if your roads are in good shape, then it costs if your roads are in bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3709.196s">So</a> we need to make sure that we are doing those improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3712.84s">And</a> then we also have a capital improvement plan, which has recognized $79 million in needs from about 123 projects across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3725.052s">So</a> I just want to be pretty clear that when you look at what we are recommended to do by the state in order to be a financially responsible city, that means that we should continue to create a budget that we know we won't exceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3742.564s">At</a> the end of each fiscal year, we should have between 3% and 5% of that total budget unspent, which is called free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3749.708s">Those</a> funds can move into our stabilization funds where we can spend them <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3754.275s">properly</a> take care of our city, which will allow us to spend less in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3760.961s">And</a> of course, we also want to have new growth through more commercial growth and new housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3765.965s">We</a> already are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3766.946s">The</a> last three years have seen Medford's highest new growth in the past two decades, and we will continue to encourage new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3772.911s">Unfortunately,</a> this is a slow process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3775.053s">It</a> cannot fix our budget shortfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3777.415s">And</a> because of rising costs of schools, insurance, pensions, inflation affecting every department, <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3782.959s">and</a> other costs that we cannot control, we need to increase our annual budget, and that means voting yes on the overrides and on the debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3790.683s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3714.721s">I</a> definitely want to take a look at this doc later with a little more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3720.466s">First</a> thought is that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3725.171s">want</a> us to encourage more density within buildings we have a lot of homes that have four or five bedrooms and one person living in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3733.758s">And</a> I think that we want to go ahead and encourage folks to live with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3741.775s">to</a> relieve our affordable, our sort of housing issues that we have here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3745.836s">So</a> I just wanna make sure that if we're making definitions that we're not sort of defining anything as more than four people living together, it's like a separate sort of definition of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3756.538s">And</a> I just wanna be a little bit careful on that front. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3758.698s">It</a> looks like some of those definitions are like anything more than four and you're defined as a strange form of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3765.739s">So</a> that's my only thinking without really having time to sort of look more deeply into it.<h2><a href="../2024-09-11_qU-78lPQllo/2024-09-11_qU-78lPQllo.html">City Council 09-10-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3335.868s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3337.209s">I</a> wanted to mention that I did knock on thousands of doors last summer and fall, and this issue came up really a surprising number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3347.335s">How</a> many residents commented that within the first few years after completely repaving a street, that some project would come in and rip up the street again, and that they felt that that was a poor use of city funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3363.704s">So</a> I think this is important that we, as a city, require full repaving of city streets when it is within five years of the paving of a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3378.208s">I'm</a> sure that it is within the business model of National Grid to fully repave roads that have been from curb to curb that have been paved within the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3391.109s">simply</a> because that is just a normal process of doing business, doing the kind of business that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3396.974s">It</a> may also be something that you realize that when a city council has changed personnel, that perhaps you might get a different opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3407.823s">And</a> that may be your job, but my job is to fight for what the city should be getting in this business contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3416.61s">And</a> within this business contract, it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3420.965s">The</a> normal thing, the thing that we need to request is that you do full curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3426.207s">And</a> if the agreement was made in the past, that it makes more sense for both parties for that to be moved to a different street, but that the cost of the repaving is fully reimbursed by National Grid, then I feel very comfortable with that agreement that was made in November.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=990.954s">I</a> also reached out after seeing this, I reached out to the State Auditor and I also reached out to the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=999.927s">It</a> seems quite clear from the letter that Councilor Scarpelli wrote that the request in the letter, and he says right here, to examine the issues set forth in said letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1011.134s">That</a> letter is to address issues that he mentioned, which include whether the chair properly ruled out of order a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1027.524s">state</a> piece of legislation, C43 section 22 of MTL. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1035.59s">When</a> I reached out to the state auditor, what the state auditor said was, our office does not conduct audits of city councils, full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1050.117s">We</a> can, however, conduct audits of cities if requested to do so by a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1055.579s">So</a> there's something I find very interesting happening here, which is this motion, as written, says that it is to examine the issues set forth in the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1064.883s">And</a> I'm going to tell you right now, the state auditor does not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1068.725s">That</a> is what they told me in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1072.727s">They</a> don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1073.967s">This</a> is a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1076.095s">And</a> Councilor Scarpelli seems to think that for some reason, the contracted legal team, KP Law, because they work for the mayor is different somehow from a city solicitor, which also would work for the administration and for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1095.838s">And</a> I've talked to <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1097.239s">to</a> city councilors from many cities for many years about the fact that city solicitors do work for the administration, and they tend to, you know, have administration centric ideas right that is a totally normal well understood thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1113.686s">But</a> this idea that somehow if we had a city solicitor, it would not be hired by the mayor, and yet the KP law is hired by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1121.272s">And</a> so therefore we should never take the opinion of the legal team that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1126.536s">What</a> we need to know and what was in this letter is a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1130.599s">And</a> I, unfortunately, I did not have time because this <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1134.702s">was</a> sent out on Friday, and I reached out to them on Monday, and today is Tuesday, so I have not yet spoken to the Attorney General, but I am sure that if what we want is a legal opinion from the state, we can get that legal opinion from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1149.691s">Now,</a> what's interesting is that the motion that Councilor Scarpelli has now stated is not to examine the issues set forth in said letter, which would be essentially to audit the legal <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1164.019s">opinion</a> in the particular legal statements made by the city council, which the state auditor does not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1175.472s">But</a> now it is to look at our finances around financial mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1183.094s">Now,</a> that is something that the state auditor can financially audit a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1190.356s">They</a> will charge the municipality, so the taxpayers of Medford will pay for that.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1603.173s">I</a> would simply want to understand, because it is not at all clear to me, which of these two things we're actually voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1610.061s">Are</a> we voting on for the state auditor to examine the issue set forth in said letter, which is what is written, which I'm pretty sure they will not do, because that's not what they do, or are we voting on them to look at our finances <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1621.232s">which</a> was what Scarpelli said out loud, which we already do every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1626.596s">And</a> I'm really having trouble imagining why we would want to pay the state to do a second audit when we already do them every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1634.241s">So</a> I would wanna know which of those we're voting on if there's gonna be a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1636.763s">I</a> am unclear.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4192.018s">I</a> also feel like there are so many responses that I could give. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4195.54s">It's</a> really not possible to respond to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4198.622s">First</a> of all, I was sad that your motion was Rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4205.345s">I</a> was going to vote for it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4206.445s">I</a> was also going to vote for it the week after when it was pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4210.447s">I</a> also want to know the answer to these legal questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4213.368s">I</a> do not feel as sure as Councilor Tseng that I know exactly what that law states, and I would like an official legal opinion, and I look forward to what the Attorney General says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4227.531s">I</a> also wish that, as a general rule, financial matters were brought to us earlier so that we were not under the gun and had to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4241.476s">So</a> that is a situation that we are put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4245.699s">And</a> while it is accurate to say that some pink slips went out, some pink slips go out every year, and there would have been dozens and many dozens more pink slips if we had not passed what we passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4261.229s">I</a> think it's not accurate to say that it made no difference, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4265.412s">It</a> made a big difference to our schools, whether we voted that week or the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4272.577s">I</a> don't like being, would I like another week or two to be able to look at these financial questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4277.299s">You</a> bet I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4278.22s">I'm</a> not the one putting these matters to the city council at the absolute last second so that we are forced to vote on them as fast as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4289.465s">I</a> don't like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4292.095s">I</a> really wish that I had some miraculous way to know how the 60,000 people in Medford all think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4301.342s">I'm</a> surprised to hear anyone say that they know how those 60,000 people all think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4306.726s">I</a> also am really having a lot of trouble understanding how the, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4316.963s">auditing</a> the way that the overrides were passed because the overrides are a major problem, you know, that our community is not being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4328.792s">This</a> whole argument really, I'm really struggling with this because, you know, the overrides was a question of <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4336.257s">rule</a> 21 and basically us being able to vote on them that week or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4343.108s">I</a> don't think there's any argument that rule 21 was <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4348.577s">suspended</a> and that whether that was suspended in a way that was legally like okay or not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4354.019s">I</a> think that simply is unfortunately what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4356.98s">Maybe</a> you don't like the politics of it, but that was voted on properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4360.762s">And</a> then whether the whole community has listened to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4362.843s">I</a> mean, we're literally allowing the voters for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4365.504s">We're</a> allowing the voters to be listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4367.745s">We</a> are allowing them to be listened to for the first time in decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4370.846s">And</a> I'm really struggling with this argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4374.924s">or</a> how putting overrides on the ballot so that the community can in fact be listened to by having a democratic vote where everyone can come to the ballot box, how that is not listening to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4387.494s">And</a> I will also say that all the people, I mean, the wildly overwhelming support of people who came to that meeting and spoke in support of putting the overrides on the ballot, and we're yet being told that we aren't listening to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4402.445s">That's</a> really struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4404.807s">with</a> how that can be when number one, wildly overwhelming support from the community at the meeting where we discussed it, and number two, all we're doing is putting it on the ballot so that we can listen to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4419.639s">Now,</a> finally, I wanna say that this particular matter, there is no deadline for whether we vote for an audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4433.622s">And</a> I am completely, do not understand what the heck we are auditing, because we are gonna audit everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4441.65s">We're</a> gonna audit financial mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4443.572s">We're</a> gonna audit the management style of the council president, which I pretty much guarantee you the state auditor is not going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4449.518s">The</a> number of things that have been mentioned that we are auditing, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4455.103s">what</a> this motion is here to say, and I am not gonna vote on a motion to have the state auditor come in and who knows, spend millions of dollars auditing, I don't know, any random thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4466.313s">This</a> is not a reasonable thing to vote in favor of.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6373.805s">I</a> would like to move to table because I, here's my reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6377.848s">I</a> am not confident that the money that we would spend right now would be any different from the yearly audit that we already have done by an independent team. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6388.258s">So</a> until I understand that it would be different, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6393.63s">I</a> cannot vote in favor of this because it would literally just be duplicating work that is already done.<h2><a href="../2024-06-27_RmvL56DRR5k/2024-06-27_RmvL56DRR5k.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 06-26-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=288.001s">Whenever</a> you're done, I just, I have two very small changes.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=356.774s">Sorry,</a> I'm having trouble with my mute button. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=358.276s">I'm</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=358.717s">Just</a> two very small things in the very first paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=363.522s">I</a> would <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=364.898s">I</a> would have us use a word other than elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=367.822s">I</a> tripped over it when I read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=369.143s">And</a> I think if we can say we voted to place or, you know, there's other ways to put that I would just use a different word than elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=380.947s">Because</a> it's easy to read, like, we were elected to place these, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=384.689s">Like,</a> just another word. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=386.11s">And</a> then the other one is... Sorry, can you, wait, sorry.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=398.177s">Yeah,</a> just change it to voted and then people won't be, they won't trip over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=404.921s">Ready</a> for my second one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=421.464s">So</a> I'm going off the one that you sent out today, which I thought was the latest. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=427.249s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=429.912s">Why</a> don't I mention my only other thing, and then if you guys already fixed it, then great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=433.235s">Is</a> that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=435.637s">It's</a> under general business. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=438.365s">The</a> first bullet point should be two sentences. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=442.347s">One</a> about the budget and the second one about the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=446.128s">It's</a> just a little confusing and kind of run on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=449.269s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=451.43s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=687.672s">I</a> don't know if- I would just state that we did it, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=690.634s">I</a> think we- because otherwise, like, some people might be offended that their thing didn't get mentioned, and I think it's easier to just say that we met with them and had a fruitful discussion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=803.653s">Can</a> I just chime in very quickly?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=808.729s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=810.21s">I</a> just wanted to say that I think an easy way to make it okay for the populations that we're talking to is to have the person who organized it just send them a draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=823.797s">And</a> I don't think we're gonna say anything super personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=826.378s">We're</a> not gonna mention anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=828.059s">But</a> if we send them a draft and be like, hey, this is what we're gonna say. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=832.541s">If</a> you don't let us know by next week, we'll go ahead with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=835.002s">That</a> at least gives us, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=839.073s">like</a> allows them to say, oh, you know, they prefer that they that we don't mention that one thing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1428.766s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1429.507s">Um,</a> I love the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1433.772s">I</a> think in addition to what we hear from people who already attend the meetings, I would hope that maybe at the top, we put some information for people who have never attended a meeting that simply says, hey, here's how to find out what we're going to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1447.781s">Here's</a> how to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1449.862s">Here's</a> what will happen when you come to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1452.163s">You</a> will have the opportunity to speak for three minutes on any topic, like letting people who've never been know that they are welcome and how they can begin participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1463.663s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2384.355s">Sorry,</a> I'm just talking for just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2388.477s">Tell</a> me tell me again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2389.537s">That's</a> me.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.235s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.636s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19169.901s">I</a> guess I have a second, I hesitate on two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19175.625s">One</a> is that I think that the cost of living in Medford is going up more than 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19183.61s">So</a> for non-union employees, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19190.967s">you</a> know, my general understanding of salaries in Medford is that they are across the board too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19197.269s">And</a> I do look forward to us receiving and reviewing the overview of how we compare to nearby cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19210.952s">But,</a> you know, I mean, I'm happy to give a raise, but I also hesitate to give <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19218.056s">This</a> to me is not a raise, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19219.437s">It's</a> clearly not a raise, it's a COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19221.959s">But</a> even at a COLA, I would like to see us being commensurate with other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19232.487s">And</a> then secondly, also, I'm not totally convinced that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19241.445s">As</a> well, looking, you know, I, I probably should spend a little time reviewing mayor salaries and nearby cities of similar size and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19253.011s">I</a> don't think you simply say it's 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19255.052s">I</a> also don't think that the <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19258.514s">current</a> pay of the person who sits in the mayor's chair, given the two positions that they are legally required to sit in, and the pay that they get from both of those is not a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19269.878s">I</a> don't think that can be argued. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19272.959s">So</a> I do have two points of hesitation on this one.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.112s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.473s">So</a> it seems to me that really, if we're just talking about timeline the most important thing is we don't choose to do one thing first, that we will realize when we then look at something else, but those are conflicting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3114.291s">So,</a> things like for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3117.615s">creating</a> more affordable housing and the natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3120.558s">Like</a> if we're gonna be like zoning, great, we're gonna zone everywhere for tons of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3123.9s">And</a> then we're like, oh, when we get to natural environment, we're like, oh crap, like we forgot that we actually meant to also prioritize this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3132.968s">So</a> can we just look to see which ones could conflict with each other and make sure that we look at those at the same time or close to each other?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3279.225s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.225s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.766s">I</a> just want to follow up on the point I was making and see if our planning department has any particular thoughts on that question, because I'm not convinced that the rating system that they came up with covers what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3294.955s">So</a> for example, if we're like affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3297.841s">We're</a> gonna do that first and then mitigating heat islands is gonna be last. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3301.864s">Those</a> could in fact be in conflict with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3304.205s">Whereas</a> I think 18 hour communities and balanced growth are less in conflict with each other, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3309.428s">So</a> I wanted to ask and see if you just have any initial thoughts that you could put in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3316.993s">If</a> any of these goals are things that if we don't consider them at the same time, we might regret it later.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4342.776s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4344.257s">I</a> just have four that I would say are from my four priorities, housing, the 18 hour community and specifically creating walkable neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4353.946s">So,</a> you know, little neighborhood centers, and then buildings and energy but really <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4362.674s">like</a> two thirds of our emissions come from buildings, and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4368.538s">So</a> I'm not really focused on the new building stuff, but anything we can do for existing buildings, which I know is not easy and zoning and the natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4377.624s">So</a> those would be my four. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4378.544s">Thanks.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-12_h9rFEwBYeQg/2024-06-12_h9rFEwBYeQg.html">City Council 06-11-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6428.629s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6429.87s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor, for being here, for all the work that you have done on the budget and providing us with the information early, and also on working on these proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6441.02s">People</a> who know me will know that I believe two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6445.344s">One,</a> I believe in democracy, and two, that I believe that this city has been underfunded for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6452.671s">So...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6456.585s">to</a> the first point, again, as Councilor Tseng mentioned, we are not voting to approve of these monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6464.594s">We</a> are voting to allow <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6467.13s">the</a> people of Medford to make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6470.592s">And</a> I think that we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6473.094s">To</a> me, that is the most important thing, is that we not, the only thing that we could do now, tonight, that would be the most undemocratic thing to do, would be for us to refuse to allow the voters to make this decision, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6490.145s">That</a> would be undemocratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6492.086s">So</a> that's my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6499.835s">My</a> second point is about the chronic underfunding of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6504.619s">And</a> while I certainly am all for new growth, I think it simply doesn't add up if you look at the reality of the funding of the city and at what we need in order to not be financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6522.523s">The</a> problem is that costs rise faster than Prop 2.5 allows us to raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6530.205s">And</a> if we simply look at the budget, we can see that in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6533.426s">So</a> the largest portion of the budget is our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6537.267s">The</a> second largest portion of the budget is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6539.847s">Insurance</a> is going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6541.548s">We</a> do not have any control over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6543.468s">It</a> is going up higher than we are allowed to raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6546.249s">The</a> third one is pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6549.191s">Pensions</a> we also do not control. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6550.872s">Those</a> are the top three. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6552.554s">After</a> that come police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6555.516s">And</a> the fourth one after that is roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6559.278s">I</a> want to talk about roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6561.36s">So</a> I just want people to understand that these costs, many of them are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6565.603s">They</a> are uncontrollable by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6568.705s">And</a> they're going up faster than we are allowed to raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6572.608s">So</a> this simply is something that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6576.331s">It's</a> math, you cannot make those numbers match. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6580.795s">I</a> want to talk about roads because we had a great meeting with the Commissioner, the DPW and one of the engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6589.123s">There</a> was a roads assessment done. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6590.605s">If</a> people have not looked at that roads assessment done in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6595.129s">It</a> basically said that, so the grade roads, they call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6599.531s">I</a> like to call them A, B, C, D, and F, because everybody understands grades that we get in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6606.655s">49%</a> of our roads in 2021 were rated D or F, the worst two possible qualities of roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6615.64s">Now,</a> it costs 50 times as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6618.962s">to</a> bring a road from F to A as it costs to bring a road from B to A. So the problem is if you are simply not spending enough on your roads every single year that you're allowing roads to get to be D and F, that is unbelievably financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6637.057s">because</a> the amount of money it takes to then repair those roads is like 30 to 50 times more. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6643.682s">So</a> this is years of underfunding our roads that has led us to this place and it is financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6657.192s">We</a> came out of COVID and during COVID, students everywhere suffered. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6665.063s">They</a> suffered mental health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6666.924s">They</a> suffered academic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6668.905s">They</a> suffered from family issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6672.066s">And</a> this is a reality that our students, all of our students in our schools are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6676.728s">They</a> need more supports. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6679.649s">That</a> is just a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6683.231s">And</a> the other thing about schools is that we have school buildings that have not been properly maintained, that the money to properly maintain them has not been spent in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6694.796s">That</a> means that we are in debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6696.217s">So</a> we are in road debt, we are in school debt, we are in school support debt, we are in trees debt, and I'm glad we planted 200 trees, but it is my understanding, and this is colloquially that I have heard through the grapevine, we do not have actual study yet, it's not completed, but my understanding is we lose more than twice as many trees every year as we plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6715.885s">So</a> we are in tree debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6718.186s">We</a> are in debt in terms of the salaries because we do not, our salaries are not commensurate with other cities, surrounding cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6726.848s">And</a> what that means is that it is incredibly difficult now for us to fill positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6734.31s">We</a> have turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6736.25s">This</a> is financially irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6740.27s">So</a> the problem is not, like the problem that we have, new growth, there is no city in the world that could create the new growth needed to fill these gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6752.118s">These</a> gaps are real. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6755.821s">They</a> are due to many things that we cannot control. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6759.143s">And</a> I believe that the proper thing to do is to allow our community to make the decision through democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6771.732s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.11s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.43s">I</a> just wanted to mention one thing for folks concerned about seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8956.133s">We</a> also have in Medford, there is something that people can request. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8960.275s">If</a> you're a senior, you can request that you can be exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8963.718s">In</a> fact, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, from all of your, up to all of your taxes, and that can be until your property is sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8971.123s">So</a> that is something that seniors in Medford have the option of doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8975.185s">So</a> we hope that this Prop 2.5 override will not negatively impact folks in their day-to-day living expenses.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14963.578s">I</a> guess my only, not knowing very much about this, my only comment is that I will admit I do not quite understand what this actually does and if it restricts the ability for people to speak in a certain way or, like, I'm just trying to understand what this <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14979.978s">actually</a> changes material for people.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1374.209s">I</a> have a suggestion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1378.162s">Can</a> we just, at the April 30th meeting, the final vote was taken to make the budget ordinance law, make that the first bullet point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1385.904s">Even</a> though it, you know, things may be slightly out of chronological order, nobody cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1391.685s">I</a> think people just need to understand what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1396.686s">So</a> make that the first bullet point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1400.051s">At</a> the end of that bullet point, have our one sentence about what it is, and then the next bullet can say, in anticipation, we met many times to hear a city department's budget proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1415.265s">Or</a> in alignment with the budget ordinance, we met many times in committee of the whole to hear city department budgets.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1434.832s">Redundant,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1439.794s">To</a> the law, and so the sentence at the end of that first bullet point can be something like, this new ordinance requires that the city council and public be more <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1459.986s">be</a> involved earlier in the budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1464.568s">Is</a> that fair? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1465.068s">Do</a> you want to say more than that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1605.404s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1606.224s">I</a> just did want to mention that I have to leave at 10 after, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1611.446s">And</a> I wanted to ask, I'm fine with the newsletter as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1616.227s">I</a> don't know whether other folks are ready to vote on that, but I would ask that we <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1625.589s">That</a> I can make a motion to disband the subcommittee on listening sessions today. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1631.213s">Because</a> I think, as we discussed earlier, that it does make the scheduling part very difficult for the listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1638.958s">So</a> that would be my request that we'd be able to do that before eight.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1659.195s">Oh,</a> sorry, I thought that we were specifically going to do it at this meeting but maybe I was wrong.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1862.081s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1866.8s">Can</a> I move that the chair can always add the links in? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1871.062s">Any</a> links that the chair deems necessary, the chair can always add those links that are relevant and necessary into the final document.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1889.231s">Yes,</a> to approve the newsletter.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1892.793s">As</a> amended, as edited.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1897.554s">And</a> keep the paper in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1898.895s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_UEleLeeXrzM/2024-06-01_UEleLeeXrzM.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 05-22-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1698.859s">So</a> the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1700.423s">That</a> part I understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1701.625s">Maybe</a> I'm not understanding the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1702.928s">It's</a> two different lots, but they share one wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1705.493s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1705.914s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2968.234s">So</a> I know that the same way that we don't want height things into the zoning definitions, we probably also don't want hours in the zoning definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2980.162s">But</a> I will say that when I think of a neighborhood cafe and about zoning and having neighborhood cafes in more closer to residential neighborhoods, <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2988.727s">I</a> do think of ours as part of the reason why a cafe is more acceptable than an eating establishment, than a dinner place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2998.87s">Because</a> a dinner place is going to be open until 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3002.331s">A</a> cafe, you know, big closed by 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3004.992s">So</a> I don't know where that belongs or if it just doesn't belong at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3009.916s">But</a> I just wanted to mention that in terms of, it does seem to me to be related to zoning in terms of where we might want to have places that are open late at night and where we might not want to have places that are open late at night.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4043.992s">I</a> really do, given what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4047.414s">I</a> think having two frontages and a primary and a secondary makes a lot more sense because of the sort of spacing that will happen between front lines and the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4061.641s">I</a> think that would really help.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5213.184s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5213.484s">Did</a> you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5214.165s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ZkSmsyn-XNs/2024-06-01_ZkSmsyn-XNs.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 05-21-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=523.409s">Just</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=525.029s">As</a> a newbie councilor, there are a number of canine services, canine workers maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=530.592s">I'm</a> just curious about this.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_kB9FUBQF7vM/2024-06-01_kB9FUBQF7vM.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 05-15-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=33.684s">I</a> just wanted to check in on something, which is, I do have a, I have a workshop, an old workshop that I used to give on how to do these kinds of listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=45.694s">So</a> I haven't sent it because I'm like. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=47.416s">Is</a> your mic on? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=49.197s">It</a> is on, but I'm not talking to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=52.48s">I've</a> just been thinking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=58.105s">uh,</a> not getting in trouble with, uh, bidding law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=61.969s">And</a> I, I guess what I should do is send a copy to you and the clerk, and then it'll get distributed at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=69.796s">Is</a> that the appropriate thing to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=71.398s">It's</a> just like how to run one of these sessions.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=93.254s">and</a> that works for open meeting law?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=126.706s">Great,</a> okay, good.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=142.398s">Great,</a> and then I will look it over before I send it, because I know it's not exactly designed for what we're doing, but it's kind of like a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=153.064s">general</a> like how-to designed for local electoral politics generally.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=163.69s">Yes</a> and and part of that is gonna and I think part of what is recommended in because it's really designed for like one <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=171.934s">City</a> Councilor or one like Mayor or somebody to run them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=176.339s">And</a> so I think one of the things we probably will not adhere to very closely is that really the meetings are designed to be not public, not open to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=188.474s">They're</a> designed to be like safe spaces for a specific community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=192.659s">And</a> I think we will not be doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=194.981s">We</a> will have ours be more public, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=198.865s">But</a> the idea that if you really want to understand, for example, the Haitian community, you go to a Haitian church, you don't have it be like any random person from Medford could show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=210.275s">You</a> have it be like a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=212.157s">of</a> people that knows each other and you know in a place where they usually congregate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=218.642s">So</a> what we're doing is going to be a little bit different but I think it'll also be, it'll still have a little bit of that kind of flavor of a <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=227.808s">you</a> know, a space where people feel comfortable because we're going to go through the community liaisons, we'll have it like at the senior center because we're going to these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=235.371s">I</a> think, you know, it will lend itself a little bit more towards people opening up, which is the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=241.533s">It's</a> like for people to feel comfortable that they can open up about what their lives are like.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=258.784s">And</a> if I apologize, I was just realizing I didn't really answer your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=262.406s">Your</a> question was more about the gist. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=263.426s">And</a> I said what we weren't going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=264.727s">But</a> the gist is the purpose is not for us to be like, here are policies that we want to know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=270.869s">The</a> purpose is really for us to ask more <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=276.437s">general</a> questions about what their lives are like. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=280.518s">But</a> ideally, we've talked to someone in that community beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=284.62s">We've</a> had a conversation, like whoever's going to facilitate a conversation talks to somebody beforehand who can say like, hey, this community is probably going to want to talk about X, Y, or Z. So we have some idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=296.644s">We're</a> not just sort of randomly asking questions about their lives, but we know a little bit about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=301.586s">And</a> let me just give one example. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=306.007s">before</a> COVID, I was running a campaign for, you know, the first couple of months before COVID hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=313.549s">And</a> then COVID hit and I couldn't do these listening sessions, but I did get a chance to speak to someone from a particular community who, and you know, it was, I was wishing that I could have a listening session, but I didn't end up having one because of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=330.093s">But</a> the person that I talked to really helped me to understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=334.25s">Most</a> of the people in that community were health care workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=338.712s">Many</a> of them were working with the elderly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=341.693s">And</a> so the impact on that community of COVID specifically was really devastating because the number of their patients who were dying, the number of <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=354.332s">you</a> know, the other people that they knew who were also, you know, nurses and caretakers who were dying of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=362.394s">I</a> mean, it was really an eye-opener for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=366.075s">And</a> to think about like how to ask those questions and really understand like what could be done from a policy perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=373.337s">And</a> obviously that's like a, that was a critical time and a really unusual thing, but I wouldn't have known <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=381.181s">about</a> that particular aspect if I hadn't talked to someone who knew that community really well first. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=386.806s">So</a> knowing sort of what to ask is always good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=390.089s">And</a> I think with the community liaisons especially, we'll be able to talk to the liaisons themselves and maybe get some of that from those folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=398.897s">It'll</a> be easy because they work for the city and we have access to those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=402.721s">So</a> that'll be a nice conversation.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=466.1s">So</a> I actually would, I think that the senior center is a really good opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=472.202s">As</a> I was talking to seniors on the campaign trail, I'm sure you also have like stories on the campaign trail, you know, we all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=478.544s">You</a> know, they had very particular concerns that are things we can address, concerns about transportation specifically, like how to get from one part of the city to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=486.807s">Folks</a> in West Medford talked about the, you know, commuter rail, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=491.028s">not</a> being ADA compliant, like at that one particular place and how difficult that made their ability to use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=499.29s">Obviously,</a> we don't have control of the commuter rail, but as city councilors, it is something that we can, you know, push the state legislators for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=507.292s">You</a> know, I wouldn't go in and talk about whether they have job opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=511.392s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=511.813s">Like,</a> there are things you do and don't talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=513.693s">And</a> I think, you know, it can definitely be tailored toward <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=519.471s">seniors</a> and talking specifically and asking them questions to sort of bring out like, how is Medford serving you? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=530.238s">We're</a> at the senior center, so we don't want to get them complaining about the senior center itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=535.062s">So</a> we want to be delicate about that particular aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=539.705s">But</a> I think there are a lot of things that Medford can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=544.734s">And</a> even maybe some conversations, I know like Arlington, because I met my mom, they have a really great like senior, you know, I forget what they call it, but it's like the senior center, it's like a community center for elderly, Council on Aging or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=563.698s">And</a> they have tons of programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=565.439s">I've</a> heard seniors talk about lack of programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=568.982s">They</a> want to talk about the sidewalks, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=571.504s">I</a> mean, so I think there are like very directed questions that we can have to understand how Medford can serve seniors better. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=581.953s">And</a> it's a really, I think it's a great one to try out this, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=588.118s">targeted,</a> facilitated conversation rather than just a chitchat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=591.88s">That's</a> what I would do if I were there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=685.387s">Um,</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=686.528s">And</a> again, it is designed for like one elected official to be doing these rather than like a group that so therefore no open meeting law, you know, we don't, it doesn't consider any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=698.198s">Um,</a> let me just take a peek.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=713.334s">Oh,</a> wonderful, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=715.594s">Great,</a> that makes me happy.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=743.408s">Hang</a> on.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=782.667s">I</a> love that idea that one person is the point person and they're the facilitator and they meet with the person beforehand to figure out what the question to be.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=893.527s">I</a> really believe that we would actually, after this meeting, where I think we should <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=900.441s">Like</a> I like your suggestion about one person kind of owning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=904.544s">I</a> think we should also maybe divvy up the work tonight for how to reach the different, it's only nine groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=910.147s">We</a> just split it up between the three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=912.509s">And</a> after that, I would actually really like to disband this subcommittee because I think it makes it very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=919.353s">No</a> two of us can ever talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=921.535s">And</a> I think that we will have, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=923.636s">more</a> ability to get things done if I can call one of you and say, hey, did you call this person or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=930.48s">Like,</a> it just makes more sense to me if we disband this after tonight.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1039.556s">I</a> just sent it to Adam, sorry, the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1046.258s">So</a> hopefully we can take a little peek at it before we leave today.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1184.475s">Matt,</a> are you getting these extras? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1187.436s">Putting</a> them on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1189.237s">Sorry,</a> I was- Should we have a spreadsheet or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1193.258s">We</a> write these down somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1195.342s">and</a> the date that we have them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1196.763s">I</a> don't know, this might be useful.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1247.298s">Okay,</a> so, so far I have- And we can, from this subcommittee, if you want, we can meet with the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1252.663s">I</a> mean, we already have nine groups, so we can, any additions, we can always be like, people committee, we would like to add these.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1258.768s">Vote.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1260.269s">And</a> then on it goes, so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1298.503s">And</a> then... Unless she thinks two in different parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1302.327s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1396.253s">I</a> would take the nine that we already decided and split them up between the three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1400.334s">The</a> eight left aside from the three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1403.235s">Just</a> split them up between the three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1405.096s">And</a> then just for scheduling purposes, as soon as we talk to somebody, we'll pay you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1412.94s">I</a> don't think they'll overlap naturally. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1415.161s">I</a> think a lot of them will be like, oh, let's do something two, three months from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1418.383s">And</a> as we're scheduling, we'll have a moment to check in and make sure that they're not too late.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1459.264s">Oh,</a> I thought the three of us are doing all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1461.166s">Just</a> the three of us.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1470.696s">I'm</a> happy to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1472.258s">I</a> love the community liaison.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1479.706s">The</a> two high school sites and Tufts, that's already three.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1513.8s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1515.882s">And</a> will you send this out in the meeting minutes?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1586.424s">I</a> will do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1588.166s">I'll</a> do the Spanish-speaking community liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1589.907s">I'll</a> do the Black African-American community liaison and also the West Medford Community Center and I'll work with both of them to see whether we want one or two.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1604.157s">Oh,</a> I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1605.038s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1611.206s">Haitian.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1615.988s">I</a> mean... Yeah, I think he thought you said Asian-American, but you probably said Haitian-American. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1621.17s">Oh,</a> okay, okay, that was... Yeah, that's the confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1623.171s">Okay,</a> so, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1623.831s">So</a> Haitian is you, unless you want to give it to me, either way is fine.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1683.828s">I</a> would also mention that like I have <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1686.269s">where</a> I've had a long ongoing conversation with Kuliyan from the Bangladeshi community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1693.253s">He</a> is supposed to be working on setting up one of these for me, a listening session literally just like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1698.476s">And</a> so, you know, if we want to, I think we loop him in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1701.978s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1702.279s">Because</a> he is interested and already was planning on it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1716.788s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1718.129s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1720.272s">If</a> I am, then maybe you take Haitian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1722.314s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1722.674s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1734.486s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1734.746s">Unless</a> you want to do the Haitian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1736.914s">I</a> know Whomiyoon and also Foxy and Nicole pretty well, so, and I've been talking to Whomiyoon about it, so I'll work with Whomiyoon in ICM. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1746.341s">And</a> also I've been doing the West Country Community Center a bunch, so I'm happy to be doing that one as well as the Aftermarket Community Day event.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1796.238s">Can</a> I super quick talk to you guys through this doc?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1802.861s">So</a> I actually had to cut out a bunch of other stuff out of this particular document. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1806.943s">So</a> this is like a portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1808.084s">So</a> if there's anything that's like, oh, see the XYZ earlier in this document, it's not there, don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1813.646s">I</a> left in just this little introduction about the model that you will find humorous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1820.29s">Because</a> it's like, oh, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1823.351s">We're</a> on a slate of candidates on a single platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1825.553s">They're</a> like, oh yeah, I recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1828.195s">And</a> then I also left in what is called the pitch, just because, I don't know why I left it in there, but I know it happens later, I mention it later, so I think that's why I left it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1839.524s">Anyway,</a> starting on page four is where we start talking about the continuous time hauls, and you can see that before doing it, you choose the constituency, you contact the group leader, you set a time and location, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1850.691s">And</a> then you work with that group's leadership to come up with questions, right, that relate to the concerns of the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1856.413s">And</a> then at the event.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1864.213s">That's</a> why it's not really like, we fit it into like a raising small dollar donations workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1871.941s">It</a> was one of the pieces, including like house parties were another piece, there were different other pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1876.845s">So</a> just don't worry about that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1879.728s">Like</a> I said, I would have pulled all that stuff out, but in this particular case, it's more just for the part that's like starting at page four.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1896.463s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1897.244s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1897.564s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1899.766s">I</a> will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1901.207s">Um,</a> but like a short intro, so people kind of understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1905.578s">And</a> then it should really be 70% listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1909.041s">And</a> I do think that, like, you know, this sort of 30% helping to educate people, because a lot, like, the idea is that a lot of these people, maybe if they don't vote in city politics, have no idea what, how it even might affect their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1924.414s">And</a> so helping them to sort of understand how they can become more involved in the community, how can they become more involved <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1929.98s">you</a> know, politically and people that they know can run for office or get involved like that, I think is a helpful part of it if it comes up, but we don't have to do that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1977.319s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1979.22s">Oh,</a> to disband this committee, I think is not a bad idea.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_zI7b343mLuM/2024-06-01_zI7b343mLuM.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 05-15-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5230.975s">I</a> just have a general question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5232.075s">I</a> know that we're having a tree inventory done, and I've come to understand that we probably lose more trees than we plant each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5241.939s">Do</a> you have a dream for the forestry department that would allow us to plant as many trees as we lose each year?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5322.83s">And</a> just to follow up, do you know when we'll get the geometry and the vulnerability assessment?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5975.427s">The</a> compost, you say you're building a list, and currently we have a relationship with Is It Garbage to Garden? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5984.153s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5985.253s">And</a> is that how the list is built, is through them, or is there also a separate list?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6035.607s">And</a> so just so that I understand, that is through Garbage to Garden that we're doing our long-term compost project. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6041.192s">It's</a> not going to end up being in the city.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6832.525s">So</a> is this the fund out of which we have to repair all of our 120-year-old pipes?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6843.113s">And</a> I apologize for this newbie question, but where in here am I looking for an increase because we got to start repairing these pipes? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6853.515s">Which</a> budget item?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6976.599s">And</a> if I hope you don't mind if I just follow up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6979.301s">So</a> we're trying to wrap our heads around an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6985.465s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6988.117s">You're</a> saying if we had sort of in-house people, which I imagine is because you say it's part of a plan for the future, like that is really how a city would normally be run is you're using this budget to make sure that you maintain all of the lines.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7004.05s">So</a> is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7007.247s">I</a> mean, should I be looking in this budget for like us at least beginning to do some of that work this year, this fiscal year? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7013.371s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7108.914s">And</a> then my final question, I think, is about retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7112.776s">Retained</a> earnings, by that, do you mean what enters <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7119.994s">the</a> enterprise fund from the rates that is not spent in that fiscal year, that that should be something that we are, you know, sort of filling that bucket year by year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7131.004s">And</a> is that something I can see here? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7135.208s">Or</a> is this really just a budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7136.469s">So</a> we're not seeing sort of what is being retained?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6070.137s">I</a> will try to find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6071.598s">I</a> did find the exact number, 2129.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6110.897s">Yes,</a> it was quite shocking to realize that it has been the practice of cities, at least has occasionally happened that they seize entire property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6121.052s">for</a> a small amount of debt and then keep the profits, keep the rest of what they sell that probably for the sins, utterly absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6130.121s">So</a> I am in support. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6131.902s">I</a> will say that as I was canvassing, I remember talking to someone who lived next door to a micro lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6140.41s">that</a> the city had appropriated from a, this was the story, so this is not verified, but this was from a resident saying that the micro lot between their house and their neighbor's house was something that the city had taken <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6155.701s">because</a> of past due taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6159.124s">And</a> that it then was an eyesore filled with weeds and rats that worked with their nearby residents to try to come up with some sort of plan to purchase it from the city and the city refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6170.072s">So</a> at some point in time, Medford had been taking portions of lots <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6177.901s">to</a> instead of back taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6181.303s">And</a> I will also say that even if I'm happy to hear that the court has now determined this is not lawful, but even if the city of Medford is not currently doing something, administrations change, and it is important that we ensure that this is not allowed to happen in the future.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1073.165s">Did</a> we feel that it was discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1074.366s">Because</a> I had questions about the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1077.108s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1078.088s">Sorry,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1081.631s">For</a> the multifamily dwelling, I visited a property in Medford that was two buildings, a single family and a two family on the same property. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1094.319s">The</a> owners lived in the single family, and they rented out <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1096.854s">both</a> those two families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1097.855s">And</a> according to this, that would not count as a multifamily dwelling because it says two or more buildings on the same lot with more than one residential dwelling unit in each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1109.04s">Because</a> one of those was a single family, that whole lot would not count as dwelling multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1115.824s">Is</a> that accurate?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1262.315s">So</a> I guess if I could just finish up my question, I'm just curious, like, how much do we need to hash these out here in this meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1272.02s">Or</a> is, like, before we officially agree on these definitions, like, at what point are we, like, sitting down and saying, okay, do we think that, you know, this is the definition that we want? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1282.185s">Or</a> do we want it to be more like some rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1283.666s">Or</a> do we, like, when is that appropriate time for us?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2005.094s">I</a> found the detached two-unit is Philadelphia-style, because it doesn't share the walls.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2021.28s">Sorry,</a> above and below. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2022.621s">Philadelphia</a> style just means there's one room of the first floor on the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2025.983s">Anyway,</a> that doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2027.163s">But</a> like above and below, I thought was detached. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2030.085s">And</a> duplex is attached.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2326.404s">might</a> I suggest that we go through all these other terms that are maybe a little bit, require a little bit less discussion and see if we can get through some, and then we can come back to this, you know, multi-unit definition, which may require more discussion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3058.786s">Just</a> an amusing anecdote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3061.328s">As</a> I was canvassing, I passed by a van, and inside that van, they were washing dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3070.773s">It's</a> like mobile doggie daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3073.795s">It's</a> so weird.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3110.425s">I</a> will say, I believe that the colloquial is doggie daycare and not dog daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3115.627s">I</a> think people say doggie daycare, so I would leave it as doggie because that's what people say.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3766.917s">I</a> was just gonna say, for what you're talking about, which is housekeeping, in the non-housekeeping example, do they each pay the landlord individually rent? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3778.284s">Because</a> that's another way to sort of define it, is to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3783.288s">Are</a> these people all paying rent as a unit, or is the landlord requiring, like, are these people who don't cooperate, and therefore they each pay separate rent to the landlord? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3794.032s">That's</a> a little bit more easy to define than housekeeping.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4092.145s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4092.946s">I</a> will say this issue is very important to me as someone who has lived in intentional communities for almost my entire life and had difficulty being able to live with other people, being afraid that the landlord will discover that in a four bedroom house, the four of us are unrelated and therefore we're going to be kicked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4110.698s">I</a> think there's a lot of fear among tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4114.12s">And</a> yet I also think that the idea of being forced to live with other people that I don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4118.963s">is</a> horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4120.684s">So</a> to me, what you're surfacing here is exactly has been a lot of my life experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4126.465s">And</a> so to me, this is an extremely important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4130.326s">And</a> I really like the way that you're thinking about the things that matter are not the number of people, which is a health department issue, but the things that matter are, do the tenants want to live this way? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4144.21s">Or</a> is the landlord forcing them to live this way? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4146.99s">So</a> I very much appreciate this difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4149.552s">But</a> whether we define it using housekeeping or define it using separate rents or define it, you know, the way that we determine it, I think can be massaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4161.059s">But</a> to me, those are the two important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4165.302s">That</a> is the important difference between the two is like, is this something that tenants are choosing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4169.605s">And</a> yes, they are fine having, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4172.276s">one</a> extra person, or if somebody there has a young child, they're fine with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4176.518s">Or</a> are these people who are really being forced to live together by the landlord? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4179.539s">So</a> I would want to be able to zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4181.62s">It</a> doesn't mean that we're saying it can't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4183.46s">It</a> just means we can zone them and have an awareness of what's happening.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5435.31s">I</a> will say I'm particularly fond of tiny homes, given especially how much demand we have for one bedrooms and two bedrooms that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5444.074s">So</a> I think having a definition would be great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6121.948s">It</a> says accessory, but it's very clearly a use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6124.21s">It's</a> like a use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6126.432s">So</a> it's pretty clear, the exact same word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6129.214s">So</a> it sounds like you're saying that the not changing the character of the premises of a neighborhood is a standard, and you want to remove that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6459.731s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6460.132s">I</a> apologize, but I will have to leave due to family <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6464.215s">Not</a> quite emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6466.777s">And</a> I just want to ask a pre-question before we start discussing the coverage of lot and ask whether we need any kind of a definition of permeable surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6475.064s">If</a> we're going to be adding something in about percentage of lots or amount of permeable surface, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6484.211s">I</a> just wanted to toss that in there to see if that can be discussed in this last.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_yQHm3T4_jqM/2024-06-01_yQHm3T4_jqM.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 05-07-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=188.123s">I'll</a> just say I did read through the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=190.627s">It</a> seems pretty comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=191.748s">I</a> don't see any glaring omissions or anything that I would change at this moment.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=328.481s">I'm</a> not convinced that that is accurate, and I don't want to put that in here in case it is not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=333.484s">I</a> think open meeting law is open meeting law, and we don't need to write our interpretation of open meeting law into this document, is what I would say.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=351.016s">I</a> mean, it is my understanding that <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=354.577s">I,</a> as a city councilor, can post whatever I want on X, like I can say my opinion on X, and it doesn't mean that other city councilors cannot also state their opinions on, and by X, I actually mean X Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=365.941s">I'm</a> talking about the actual thing, not like a thing with the letter, not the algebra. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=373.723s">So</a> this is why I'm concerned, because if we're putting into this some interpretation of open meeting law that I think may not be applicable <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=384.557s">And</a> it doesn't really matter whether I'm right or wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=386.338s">It</a> just, I think, matters whether we are 100% legally sure that that is, in fact, accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=393.141s">And</a> even if it's accurate, we already have opening law? <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=395.422s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=395.782s">I</a> just feel like it might be not necessarily and potentially inaccurate.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2590.829s">would</a> you like Councilor Tseng to go first?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2669.622s">Um,</a> so I think just for logistics, we two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2673.786s">Number</a> one is that we should not have more than two Councilors at each one of these, we should just decide that that is what we're going to do because I think it's impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2684.537s">to</a> ensure that some policy that is upcoming won't be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2689.839s">Like</a> that's just the nature of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2692.639s">And</a> so I think we should just decide no more than two councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2696.74s">And</a> then the question is, how do we make those decisions from a logistical standpoint? <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2700.622s">The</a> other question that I have is, and I know that we, I was the one who proposed that we have a subcommittee, that subcommittee has not met yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2708.484s">Given</a> that there is a subcommittee, even any two of us on that subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2713.125s">cannot</a> appear at the listening session. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2715.386s">So</a> I'm wondering if perhaps, given that there's already a listening session later this month, if perhaps tonight we should disband the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2723.669s">Even</a> though it would be nice to have a subcommittee to discuss this, I think it might be more in the way, given open meeting law, then it will help. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2732.092s">And</a> maybe we just have these discussions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2736.713s">So</a> I will make that as a motion, but I would love to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2739.314s">I'm</a> not, you know, for sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2741.479s">that</a> that is the right way to do things.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2913.879s">Through</a> the chair, I would be super interested in understanding if there are any specific questions, what exactly would be asked of legal counsel?

There were five different strategies that were recommended, and we are repairing the roads <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1361.797s">better</a> than the middle strategy, but not as well as the top strategy because we do not have the funding to do that level of repair to the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1372.861s">So</a> if there is going to be an improvement in the roads in Medford, it does look like funding will have to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1382.865s">It</a> just comes straight out of both of those pavement assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1386.176s">And</a> that was what we discussed in, oh, they also have, they bought the equipment to do a hot tub crew, to have an internal crew doing road repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1397.604s">They</a> just need to have to access the funding to be able to staff that, which we think will be less expensive than, for certain levels of repair will be less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1409.651s">So</a> that's the update for that.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7578.595s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7579.896s">So</a> I just want to comment that what I described as the process is for ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7584.7s">It's</a> not necessarily for resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7586.742s">Resolutions</a> don't have to go through three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7589.724s">Different</a> things that we pass through this body have different requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7594.508s">I</a> certainly was not under the impression that the newsletter had a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7598.712s">Each</a> individual monthly newsletter has its own paper number, and therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7603.095s">must</a> come out of committee and then be discussed in this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7606.697s">I'm</a> happy to do that if that is what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7609.718s">But</a> I did think that that committee had the ability to pass a newsletter, since it's simply a thing that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7619.822s">I</a> totally appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7621.143s">I'm</a> very happy to change that understanding of mine and to have those sent to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7626.365s">I'm</a> not convinced that that would be a great idea, because I think editing, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7632.364s">hundred</a> and fifty word newsletter in the city council meetings does not seem like a super great use of time.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7992.281s">I</a> hope this can be clarifying for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7996.741s">I</a> think the idea is that we have a discussion as a community about what we would want, whether we want it, what it would look like in terms of a transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8007.849s">The</a> letter that was signed is for the state to allow us to have that discussion, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8015.534s">I</a> mean, we can discuss it all we want, but we won't be able to- To give us the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8019.677s">To</a> give us the authority, right, to have to, once we've had that discussion, to actually pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8029.565s">The</a> idea of like, I think we all want to be able to have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8034.007s">We've</a> literally not written a single word. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8036.688s">We</a> want to have the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8039.209s">And</a> that letter doesn't do anything but try to enable us to be able to have the discussion as a community.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10513.289s">Thank</a> you, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10515.971s">I</a> understand that many constituents oppose a real estate transfer fee and that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10522.156s">know</a> to make an analogy with theft makes it makes it seem like something of conviction uh for or against something i think a much better analogy is a minimum wage law so in california and other states cities can pass any kind of minimum wage law they want to in massachusetts we cannot um i would sign a something at the state level saying <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10542.95s">please</a> allow any city or town in Massachusetts to pass any minimum wage that they deem necessary in their own city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10550.215s">But</a> that doesn't mean that I would want an infinity minimum wage in Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10554.498s">So</a> you vote, you push for the state to enable you, it's called enabling legislation, to enable you to pass the laws that are correct for your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10563.905s">And</a> then within your community, you have the discussion about what would be the right minimum wage for Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10570.734s">And</a> that is the question that we are having, which is, you know, we are about to begin a long discussion, including the public, about what kind of real estate transfer fee might be the right one for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10584.447s">But</a> that doesn't mean that individual sitting elected officials who also, by the way, have websites that declare that they, you know, people run on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10595.745s">You</a> know, there are things that are on my website that are issues that I support and I ran on those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10600.227s">I</a> told people when I was running that I would support those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10604.289s">That</a> is why I got elected, because those things were on my website at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10608.411s">And</a> as city councilors and other elected officials to sign in support of the state, allowing communities to make whatever decision they want doesn't mean that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10619.824s">you</a> know, I'm gonna support a $500 minimum wage in Medford, even if I think that any community should be able to have any kind of minimum wage they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10626.888s">So</a> I just think that that analogy-wise, it's a better analogy that we want the state to allow us to make those decisions.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10843.314s">speaker,</a> I appreciate you coming up to the podium.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11209.664s">I</a> would like to remind everyone that we are discussing the process dealing with possible home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11218.694s">It</a> is very important to me <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11221.28s">that</a> comments made by constituents who are knowledgeable, who should be heard from, and comments made by members of this committee who also are knowledgeable and who should be heard from, all of those comments should be heard by the public at a meeting where they know that this is going to be discussed.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11699.096s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11795.801s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12484.972s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12487.813s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_Imw9nvnGj3M/2024-06-01_Imw9nvnGj3M.html">City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee 04-24-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=29.761s">Great,</a> so today we are doing a pavement management plan update, and I want to thank Commissioner Tim McGivern and our engineer Owen Wartella for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=38.744s">I</a> will go ahead and read the text of the motions that we passed at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=46.727s">President</a> Bears has moved that we create a new paper in this committee to request an update on, one, the pavement management plan and sidewalk management plan for the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=54.529s">including</a> the financial plan recommendation that the City adopted based on the pavement and sidewalk management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=60.354s">Two,</a> what the City has spent on pavement management and sidewalk management since the plans were released. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=65.538s">Three,</a> how much was spent from authorized bond orders if funds were spent on streets and sidewalks other than those initially listed for the bond orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=72.343s">Four,</a> when the pavement and sidewalk management plans may be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=76.046s">And</a> then Councilor Scarpelli moved to ask the DPW Commissioner <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=80.342s">to</a> do a cost analysis for road and sidewalk repairs and to request a sidewalk and hot tub crew to do the work in-house and to look at the costs for Luke's sidewalker and to have that be added into the duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=92.913s">I</a> welcome you and thank you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=94.715s">If</a> you would be able to give us kind of the update as requested, that would be fantastic.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=152.462s">So</a> I think maybe a little bit of understanding of the five strategies and which one of those strategies we've been following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=161.369s">If</a> you can go a little bit into that, that'd be amazing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=645.179s">You're</a> talking about both the year 2021, year 2022, year 2023, that all of those numbers in terms of being able to sort of calculate what we spent, that all of those are ones that you're working on?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=661.102s">So</a> if we're looking at what was spent each year, and you're saying that these calculations really haven't been done before, are you working on those from years starting with the 2021 pavement management study? <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=675.008s">Or</a> are you just talking about the last year?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1285.745s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1290.428s">Yes,</a> I think we're fine.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1332.517s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1332.837s">We</a> are reconvening, planning and permitting as soon as this meeting is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1337.701s">Did</a> you call me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1338.842s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1340.143s">This</a> meeting is adjourned.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ES1ix-enmPA/2024-06-01_ES1ix-enmPA.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 04-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=151.929s">It</a> looks like I can't really read all that on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=153.89s">So</a> some of these may have already been covered by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=158.933s">So</a> I would say like the leaf flow ordinance, for example, doesn't need to be covered both in the general business as well as in the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=167.678s">It</a> just might be confusing because it says, like if they only read one, they'll say, they'll think it's a second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=175.242s">And</a> then under sent to committee, a home rule petition for a real estate transfer fee, that to me is a little too, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=182.319s">strong</a> sounding, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=184.561s">It</a> sounds like we sent a home rule petition to commit, like, if I didn't know much about the city council, I would think that there was one completely written up and this language was all finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=195.869s">So</a> I think the phrasing should be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=199.652s">Open</a> day discussion or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=201.353s">Gave</a> a number to, same also with like developing a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=207.718s">That's,</a> I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=209.46s">exactly</a> what to do with that one, but I think in the same way that governance committee has just a one-liner, we also could put in public works committee as just a one-liner of like currently discussing roads and sidewalks, renovations as, you know, according to the assessment studies, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=231.526s">Could</a> be a nice simple way of just saying that, hey, this committee is looking at those things, so people care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=241.991s">Currently</a> discussing road and sidewalk renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=257.382s">I</a> don't have perfect language for this, but according to the pavement and sidewalk assessment studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=270.64s">Something</a> like that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=281.307s">Under</a> planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=282.288s">Yes,</a> I would just remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=285.23s">I</a> can't tell if Councilor Collins did that already.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=300.988s">And</a> making the language about the... Yeah, the sent to committee a home rule petition for real estate transfer fee, that one, it just, I think it's a little misleading to put it that way.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=978.08s">You</a> saw it first.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1456.6s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1457.942s">First</a> of all, you have the toughest job of doing the first one, getting all of these edits, so I really appreciate all your hard work doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1466.168s">I</a> do want to mention that if we are going to use email, if we are going to use anything that uses people's phones, which includes text messaging, which includes WhatsApp, which includes Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1476.036s">we</a> have to have opt-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1477.877s">So</a> the idea that we can't start anything until we somehow have a way to reach everyone, the way that we reach everyone is by producing something, and including, I want to make sure that we have something near the top that says, please forward this information to your friends, or here is how your friends can get on this email list, so that people will send this information to people that they know, and it will be very easy for them once they receive something from a friend or colleague, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1504.728s">for</a> them to get on the email list or on a mobile list or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1509.35s">So</a> getting folks to spread the word about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1514.472s">And</a> then two other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1517.873s">I</a> just want to make sure that with the real estate transfer fee that I think the wording that we chose was really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1525.116s">I</a> think also for the rent stabilization ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1529.315s">both</a> of those because they are very hot button issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1532.197s">We</a> have to make sure that the language is accurate to what has happened, which is we're simply opening the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1539.764s">So</a> whatever language we're using for the real estate transfer fee, we should use a similar language for the rent stabilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1547.128s">And</a> then this is a general question, something to think about maybe for next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1551.632s">I</a> would love it if in our newsletters we can include not only what has happened in the past, but what is upcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1560.279s">so</a> that maybe even if it's only just that very next week, if we know, so that people can make a plan to come, or even if it just includes maybe a link to the events page that shows people what is upcoming and a thing at the bottom that says if you want to know what we will be discussing in the City Council and in the committee meetings, go to this link.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1925.199s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1925.799s">A</a> few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1926.86s">Number</a> one, I will second your motion to have you reach out to Mr. Nwaje to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1934.743s">Second,</a> you also partially answered my question, which is going to be, what is the schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1938.465s">Because</a> I said I would do whatever was free, so I have no idea what month I'm on, but at least I'm not next month.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1945.207s">I'm</a> so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1945.828s">It's</a> in the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1946.408s">I</a> missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1947.128s">And</a> the third thing is, I'm curious why I would love to avoid having these <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1954.451s">unless</a> there's a reason having the wording of the newsletters go to the full city council meeting, it seems like really this should just be in this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1963.094s">I</a> don't understand why we would want to send it to the full city council.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1988.132s">I</a> just can't imagine having the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1990.6s">a</a> 200, 300 word document be edited in a city? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1994.463s">I</a> literally think that's the wrong place for like that is that is not the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1998.787s">I</a> mean, this is a just a communication from the city council.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2006.534s">I'm</a> not seconding that one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2059.379s">I</a> don't want us to forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2064.532s">So</a> anywhere you can just put this so that we don't forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2069.717s">Just</a> put it in that document and then we'll look at it next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2072.419s">Like</a> that we should really have a way for people to forward this to others so they can get on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2078.805s">And</a> then the idea of putting upcoming, like even just a link to the upcoming meetings would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2086.351s">Those</a> two things I think we should include in every newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2088.233s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2119.362s">The</a> other one is a way for people if they forward it for people to get on the list.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2137.557s">Maybe</a> you guys can work together to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2139.418s">And</a> even if it doesn't end up in this newsletter, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2141.64s">But</a> in the future, I think we should keep it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2157.532s">But</a> isn't there a link that has all of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2163.696s">There's</a> a link where you can see the upcoming meeting agenda.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2208.254s">The</a> question is, how can people opt in?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2431.227s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2431.828s">I</a> believe this can be quick and exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2435.469s">So</a> I'm not sure which of these should actually be motions and which should just be that we plan to keep this paper in committee and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2445.773s">But</a> I think we should, I would like to make a motion that we form a subcommittee that includes <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2455.16s">me,</a> Councilor Tseng, and Chair Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2458.923s">I</a> hope that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2462.345s">That's</a> my emotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2464.927s">About</a> the listening sessions to ensure that these listening sessions happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2469.324s">And</a> then, besides that motion, I want to open up two ideas for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2475.008s">One,</a> that we try and hold approximately one per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2478.131s">So</a> we try and hold maybe nine, you know, eight or nine this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2482.714s">And</a> then I would love to have a quick brainstorming session about which groups to reach out to <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2492.125s">Is</a> that all part of your motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2493.045s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2493.485s">Sorry,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2494.266s">The</a> motion was only about a subcommittee.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2499.288s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2499.868s">That's</a> the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2500.828s">Everything</a> else is just for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2502.129s">So</a> that we do, you know, one a month, seven or eight this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2505.57s">And</a> then Councilor Tseng and I already came up with a short list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2510.031s">So</a> we can very quickly, I think, you know, brainstorm a list of groups to reach out to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2515.473s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2551.802s">That</a> is a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2552.664s">I</a> think we'll meet as a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2555.007s">We'll</a> have to, you know, discuss exactly the logistics of how that's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2560.014s">But</a> we certainly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2563.206s">you</a> know, we can make the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2565.267s">I</a> think we can make a subcommittee open to as many people as our.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2583.714s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2584.595s">And</a> basically it will be a lot of it is just going to be doing the logistics of, you know, when to have these meetings set up and who's going to be there, that kind of thing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2607.692s">I</a> will say that I think part of the idea is not to use conference rooms and buildings, but to really go to the place where these less represented folks feel comfortable, sort of go on their turf rather than our turf. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2622.262s">So</a> that'll be something that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2624.223s">May</a> I open the discussion of some possible groups to reach out to?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2649.475s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2650.315s">So</a> first we thought there are five community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2653.103s">And</a> those are, you know, five groups that we would love to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2657.767s">And</a> then we also thought that high school students would be a really fantastic group and we could do potentially either have just have one group or we could have separate groups for the vocational school and the other half of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2675.101s">And</a> then we thought the senior center would also be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2678.204s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2681.662s">reaching</a> out maybe to some tough student groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2686.925s">And</a> that right there is like, let's see, five for the community liaisons, one or two for the high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2691.767s">Yeah,</a> that's nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2692.728s">That's</a> this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2693.908s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2702.733s">I</a> don't know the names of the liaisons themselves, but the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2709.734s">The</a> groups that they represent are the Haitian community, the Arab community, the Portuguese-speaking community, Spanish-speaking, and I believe the fifth one is black residents in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2725.849s">I</a> hope that's accurate.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2744.234s">I</a> think that is something that we should discuss in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2746.957s">I</a> think there's going to be a little bit of trying to figure out exactly how that's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2754.444s">And</a> we'll do a little bit of brainstorming to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2757.23s">you</a> know, understand the possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2758.571s">I</a> think that's just a longer discussion that we probably want to have to make this already pretty late.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2770.059s">If</a> there are other groups that folks want to reach out to, uh, you know, now is great or don't hesitate to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2781.892s">There's</a> zillions of groups we could reach out to, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2784.613s">We</a> don't want anybody to feel excluded, but we thought this would be a good starter set.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2793.736s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2794.357s">I</a> meant to include veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2796.657s">Veterans?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2797.338s">Yep.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4069.342s">So</a> just a quick question, if you happen to have these numbers off the top of your head, if not, I can look it up later. <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4074.085s">On</a> this fiscal year 2025 budget impacts with these four sort of unavoidable cost increases, do you happen to know for each of those what sort of percentage of our budget those are? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4085.171s">Like,</a> what is the health insurance, you know, what about what percent of our budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4092.544s">If</a> not, that's fine, I'll finally look at it.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1802.947s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1803.447s">So</a> to me, these letters were a <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1808.103s">quite</a> frightening reminder that our water pipes are 100 years old, almost older than any other city, and that instead of over the decades spending the money that came in through our water system on the water system and replacing these pipes for decades, that that money went into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1831.937s">and</a> was spent on other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1833.518s">And</a> so we have, for decades, not improved our water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1838.16s">We</a> have, for decades, not improved our roads, which is why that 49% of our roads as of 2021, hard to know whether that's improved or gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1851.014s">probably</a> has gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1853.135s">49%</a> of our roads are in the worst two classes of roads out of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1857.098s">That's</a> the most expensive kinds to replace, to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1861.682s">Our</a> schools, which are 20 years old, have not been properly maintained for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1867.787s">Salaries,</a> and we talk about the salary of this particular position in the water department, but salaries across the city are not commensurate with other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1880.168s">So</a> we can't find people to fill a lot of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1882.87s">It's</a> not just that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1883.931s">There</a> are a lot of positions we cannot find people to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1888.854s">Previous</a> administrations have been like 30, 40 years ago were given a city in pretty good shape and did not do the repairs that were needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1901.104s">And</a> that has left us in a position that I'm really, they've kicked the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1905.886s">And</a> I'm trying to understand what kind of management style it would make up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1910.188s">I</a> mean, if $500 million is the amount to repair our water system, and we know that it's $100 million probably or more to repair the roads, get the roads back into shape, there isn't a style of management that can <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1925.339s">magically</a> make that money up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1928.8s">My</a> thing about the management is not that I'm making any kind of statement, but my statement is about the funding that we have to do the absolute basics necessary for a city to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1942.622s">You</a> cannot have water pipes that function. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1946.143s">You</a> do not have a city, functional city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1948.083s">You</a> don't have roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1949.524s">These</a> are the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1951.164s">And</a> this isn't purely the fault of this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1954.687s">This</a> is something that we have kicked the can down the road for many decades until we find ourselves by doing things that were financially irresponsible, but were made taxpayers happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1969.817s">And</a> now we're in a position where we have had that situation going on for so long that we're going straight off a cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1986.826s">I</a> talked to some of the engineering folks about the water systems, and they said, oh, you know, there is money coming into the water system that we can use to repair it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1996.553s">But</a> of course, that money used to go to other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1999.655s">That</a> money has always come in, and it used to go to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2003.077s">So</a> now that money isn't going to be going to the things that it used to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2007.14s">So</a> those things will go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2009.081s">There</a> is not enough funding to take care of the financial irresponsibility of former administrations and former city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2017.827s">really</a> administrations because the state councils do not have do not have hardly any effect on the budget because it's really up in the hands of the mayor.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4933.997s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4935.678s">Um</a> I definitely do believe that, uh, our city's underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4939.819s">I</a> think it is a pretty simple math problem that when you don't fix your water price for 100 years, you don't fix your roads for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4945.021s">You</a> don't fix your schools for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4946.581s">You</a> don't <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4950.578s">for</a> years so that those salaries are below commensurate for other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4955.303s">I</a> think that that math problem is pretty simple one, but that doesn't mean that I believe that all of our money is being spent properly and I really appreciate this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4964.672s">I</a> think it's incredibly important that we understand and that the community also understands how money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4971.777s">and</a> that we are really responsible and that that money is not being wasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4977.42s">So</a> I really appreciate this resolution and any other resolutions that come to us having transparency and understanding the way that the city is being run and to make sure that our funds are being used well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8422.059s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8423.399s">So</a> I'm sad that we cannot have any impact over that, and it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8428.761s">And</a> so all I'm saying is to you guys, but also to anyone else, don't hesitate to come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8436.163s">If</a> we can put pressure and make the difference between that FEMA grant being in a better position to pass, then reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8444.806s">And</a> secondly, I really wanted to talk a little bit about this question of mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8450.267s">because</a> I think it is raised all the time, the question of wasting money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8457.231s">And</a> I'm curious about it, and I want to learn more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8460.472s">I</a> want to ensure that we know in terms of transparency and that the community knows how money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8466.636s">But</a> I do also think there's another question that we haven't been talking about as much about recently, which is being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8477.421s">the</a> fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8478.541s">We</a> have run departments where sorry, um, support being supportive of unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8483.522s">We</a> have many unions in the city that do not get contracts for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8488.544s">Um</a> my opinion of what has been happening this year with the fire department is that it really has demoralized <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8503.127s">a</a> fan of what has been going on between the mayor and the fire department, as I said at one of the previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8509.909s">So</a> I am interested in understanding, I really question how you guys can have a consulting firm where you're already looking into this, the mayor is doing separate consulting firm and the wisdom of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8526.293s">And</a> from a union perspective, that it seems like you're, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8532.834s">many</a> combined years of experience is not being looked to at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8538.679s">You</a> know, I have to say that I do really question the wisdom of this, and that I want to be supportive of the fire union, and I will leave it at that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9028.045s">So</a> I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9029.746s">It</a> seems that no one really is in charge of making sure that this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9034.775s">No</a> one at the trust is in charge, no one at DPW is in charge, and this sort of has just gone on because nobody's been focusing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9040.438s">Is</a> there any way to get somebody to, it's their responsibility to focus on it, or is that, you know?<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_LzzLsOJuQBA/2024-06-01_LzzLsOJuQBA.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 04-10-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=671.917s">Is</a> this the right moment for questions?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=822.153s">I</a> did just have a question about the site plan review topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=825.395s">This</a> is just my lack of knowledge about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=827.515s">Is</a> there a super brief? <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=829.896s">What</a> is that covering?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=882.38s">If</a> I may, we could take one step back and say like site plan review, like what?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2221.249s">Yeah,</a> just a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2222.65s">I</a> mentioned this last time, and I'm just curious who would be the right person to talk to about potentially <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2230.049s">what</a> it might mean to add a coworking as a zoning use. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2238.954s">With</a> the concept that instead of office, like office building is sort of the place that it might fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2243.917s">And</a> we might not want giant office buildings like scattered across Medford, but to allow like small coworking places that are designed as neighborhood connection spots and places where people can <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2257.383s">have</a> one desk and meet their neighbors and go during the day now that we're sort of in a world of remote work. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2265.729s">It</a> is not something I've thought through super deeply, but I'm curious, aside from one or two Councilors, if there are staff people or whoever that I can talk to that know more about zoning that might have some ability to speak to whether it would be useful or whether there is no need
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2707.17s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2707.83s">Just</a> looking through theme five, the climate resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2710.711s">I</a> just wanted some of these seem like they kind of lean towards this but I wanted to ask if there is currently or if there are plans to have sort of percentage of lots that can be covered by impermeable surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2731.754s">I</a> mean, I would imagine that is where it would go.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2738.762s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2739.223s">Just</a> wondering if there is anything currently in the zoning or if their plans to put in the zoning any sort of limits on the percentage of a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2748.103s">you</a> know, amount of a lot in some way that is covered by impermeables.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1530.199s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1532.02s">So</a> one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1545.311s">I</a> know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1556.319s">And</a> tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1564.306s">There</a> are also. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1566.667s">you</a> know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1578.234s">That</a> would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1587.719s">And</a> there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1591.541s">I</a> know in the climate adaptation and action plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1595.844s">it</a> has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1597.645s">There</a> are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1611.216s">I</a> know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1622.765s">know,</a> junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1641.162s">being</a> able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1647.206s">And</a> really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1664.037s">So</a> that's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1665.638s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1789.77s">Councilor</a> Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1791.271s">I</a> would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1802.477s">For</a> example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1813.064s">They</a> just don't have access to who those people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1815.995s">So</a> I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1994.664s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1995.705s">I</a> mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2001.626s">So</a> the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2011.768s">So</a> really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2015.309s">But</a> as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2018.888s">who</a> will implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2020.19s">I</a> think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2111.423s">Again,</a> this is the beginning of the conversation.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2127.515s">So</a> this is the beginning of a many months long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2135.158s">Yes,</a> this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2146.181s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2149.238s">My</a> understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4737.417s">My</a> name is amazing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4739.76s">Councilor</a> Callahan just to a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4741.402s">Renters</a> are not on the registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4744.205s">There's</a> rental properties that are on the right, so just be property owners and renters themselves are not on registry.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8214.857s">I</a> hear everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8219.021s">And</a> I think what I'm struggling with is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8224.702s">My</a> understanding of how we work on policies is we bring a suggestion for something that we might pass in a year or two years or six months or whatever, we bring it here to get it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8240.436s">Now,</a> any policy, whatever policy that is, it is by definition, it is not totally worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8250.043s">Not</a> all of the answers are there, because this is how we create policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8255.264s">We</a> create policy by giving it a number, and then by sending it through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8259.466s">And</a> that process, and tell me if I'm wrong, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8263.547s">That</a> process involves three public hearings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8267.908s">It</a> has to go through first reading, second reading, third, something like that, after it's been written.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8274.854s">After</a> all of the committee meetings, it involves three times that it has to appear before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8280.677s">And</a> that's when the answer, when all of the questions, when it's been worked through with the staff, with, you know, in committee with the public, with, you know, whatever sort of listening sessions and other things that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8295.104s">So</a> what I'm struggling with is, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8298.206s">You</a> know, we're bringing things here to give it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8303.188s">And</a> what that does is it allows us to then begin the process of discussing it publicly where everyone is welcome for many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8312.993s">And</a> I think for the, like the leaf blower ordinance, we had eight or nine, was it nine public meetings about it?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8324.844s">I</a> thought that we had the eighth leaf blower like public swap but we had a lot of meetings.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8330.608s">So,</a> I think what I'm trying to say is, this is the second time since I've been a city council which is like three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8340.97s">people</a> come, dozens of people come to the meeting to prevent us from ever being able to discuss a policy and we're being accused of not knowing all of the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8354.381s">Well,</a> the reason that we have this process is so that we can include the public in the entire discussion of every aspect of it and every detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8365.109s">So</a> what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8370.06s">And</a> I will say, I'm saddened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8372.941s">I'm</a> very saddened that I now seem to be on the receiving end of something where, specifically for in-town landlords, I have for years talked about how in-town landlords are the people that we want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8393.071s">And</a> there's video of me from years ago <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8397.89s">So,</a> like, this is, I just want to know we're coming up on the 15 minute limit for the previous question today, you have about a minute, then I want to go a minute but that's what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the conversation, so that we can talk about it for many months in open public committee meetings, and then we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8416.795s">the</a> three public hearings in the city council, all of which are designed to answer those detailed questions and for you to have input on those answers, those questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8426.781s">So</a> that's what I'm struggling to get to is the point where we can actually discuss this rather than having it shut down before anyone is allowed to discuss it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.349s">Councilor</a> Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.829s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8590.21s">This</a> is a thing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9898.045s">Oh,</a> so I was, I'm not actually in favor of reducing the amount of time that people, so I would have done this differently, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9908.392s">I</a> do think that having, and I've looked at some other cities, I have to say, I am so happy that we do something that I have not seen really anywhere else, I guess maybe Revere does it, but that we let people speak on every single agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9922.765s">Most</a> cities, there's one public comment period that applies to like anything that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9929.748s">You</a> have your two minutes during that public comment period and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9933.829s">And</a> you don't get to be there when they're debating the whole rest of, while they're debating the body is debating that particular agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9940.812s">So</a> I love that we do that and I think that we should keep that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9943.673s">I'm</a> glad this doesn't in any way get rid of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9947.515s">I</a> do think that meetings that go to one, two, three o'clock in the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9951.94s">the</a> poor people who have to speak on a topic that doesn't come up until after midnight, like that's also, that's just not good democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9963.73s">The</a> way I would have done it, and I don't know how much people are open to changes on the floor, but I think that we should have a limit on the end time of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9978.522s">And</a> if we limit the end time of the meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9982.037s">So</a> that nobody has to stay up until you know one o'clock in the morning to be heard on their on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9989.713s">Then,</a> allowing the chair, which I think we already have as an option to before any public participation to declare hey like there's 100 people in the room for this item, we're going to leave it to and we and this is currently our policy anyway that we have done for this item, we're going to have two minutes per issue we did that you know a number of weeks ago for a different issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10014.153s">And</a> that the chair can do that in order to meet the deadline of the midnight 1231 o'clock whatever it is that we decide is the final hour that this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10023.782s">that</a> the city council meetings end on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10026.064s">So</a> that's where I would go with it is have like a meeting end time so that nobody has to stay up till one o'clock in the morning just to speak on their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10035.189s">The</a> other possibility is to let public comment happen at the beginning and then have it apply to all of the agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10041.172s">That's</a> very common. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10042.853s">And</a> then nobody, no members of the public have to stay until midnight, one o'clock in the morning in order to speak on their agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10052.261s">So</a> I think there are other ways to go that would let people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10061.471s">I'm</a> just not sure that this is the one that I, I'm not sure that I love this one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10618.561s">I</a> just want to be slightly more clear than what I said before, which is I would actually really like to discuss this, to be able to come up with some other ideas in committee rather than voting on this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10632.216s">So</a> that'd be my preference.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.464s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.825s">I</a> just wanted to address one thing, because I'm feeling frustrated that I brought the rental registry here <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12851.932s">And</a> I very purposefully did not decide a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12855.453s">I</a> did not want to have come up with all the answers because I wanted to be part of the public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12860.974s">So</a> this you have already decided everything, that's why I couldn't answer questions about the details of rental registry because I don't want to come here having decided everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12870.695s">So</a> that's the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12872.015s">We</a> get a number for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12874.116s">And</a> it's frustrating that dozens of people are coming out to say, don't give it a number so that it can be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12881.912s">That's</a> what I'm having trouble with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12883.476s">I</a> want to be able to give something a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12885.0s">And</a> I think we should not have all the details before we give it a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12888.549s">But</a> then I'm being... <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12890.222s">criticized</a> that I don't have all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12894.223s">But</a> the reason I don't have all the answers is because I don't want to have come here having decided everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12899.444s">I</a> want to give it a number so that we can have a public process of many public meetings so that your opinions, the public opinions, can exactly be part of this process that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12911.988s">So</a> that's part of what I want to be able to do here is have fewer <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12919.135s">long</a> extended discussions, and I'm not talking about this particular resolution, but fewer long extended discussions that prevent us, people saying, please do not begin a discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12931.543s">I</a> would much rather people come to the discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12934.465s">Like,</a> let's agree to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12936.467s">And</a> then we can have the discussion where people can give their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12939.569s">But</a> to come here with dozens and dozens of people saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12943.171s">Whatever</a> you do, you're a terrible person, if you agree to allow this to be discussed, I find it... This is why you might see me not, quote-unquote, listening to dozens of people, because all I'm voting for is for it to be allowed to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12962.203s">And</a> I think it should be discussed and that's for, you know, these other things, whether it's the real estate transfer fee, the rental registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12971.087s">All</a> I'm saying is, we should be able to discuss it in open public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12976.59s">This</a> is part of what I'm a little bit frustrated with is the idea that we're coming here having already decided and then suddenly it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12983.193s">to</a> zero or six to one or five to two because we've already decided, but like all I wanted to do is discuss and be able to like have the open public forum that you are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12995.997s">So</a> I guess that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12997.737s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15705.797s">Sorry,</a> I just don't exactly understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15708.999s">Is</a> that there's a B paper attached to this motion.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15735.244s">Can</a> you restate that B paper?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15762.423s">I</a> think that is a great idea.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15890.106s">Yeah,</a> just that when there is a question of whether we're going to send something to committee to be able to open a many months long discussion, I'm going to vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15901.135s">I</a> think we need to be able to have those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15903.917s">This</a> is actually something that we're gonna be changing these rules today, and that will be a permanent change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15910.363s">And</a> I don't feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15911.524s">I</a> didn't feel comfortable when I read it, and my position has not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15917.31s">So</a> I'm not gonna be voting this one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21920.964s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21921.944s">Yep,</a> I think it says it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21924.005s">We</a> are really just sending this into committee to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21927.186s">Hopefully</a> it will be a way for us to reach out to people who rarely or never come to these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21934.329s">Those</a> 70% of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21936.15s">Well,</a> the 50% of people who never vote in city elections, 70% who didn't vote in this particular city election. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21941.332s">70%</a> who didn't vote for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21946.694s">Those</a> folks who are not engaged politically, we want to be able to hear what their lives are like, and that's what this is about.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_uzQnYqVC9YY/2024-06-01_uzQnYqVC9YY.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 03-27-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1268.173s">Do</a> we think that it's appropriate given that a lot of this is for new construction, and some of it may be fossil fuel stuff construction in buildings, is this a place where we can request that the departments that we're talking to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1286.434s">incentives</a> for our climate goals or our affordable housing goals that are lined out in our various plans, like the CAP, the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, or our Affordable Housing Production Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1302.398s">Can</a> we ask that they take those into consideration when they are updating?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1799.938s">As</a> I'm scrolling through all these many fees, I do notice taxi cabs on here, and I'm curious if the city has done anything about including the gig worker cab things into, I assume that this only applies to actual taxi cabs and not to like Uber drivers and everything else, <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1818.083s">So</a> I don't know whether, I mean, that seems to me clearly to be totally outdated, and maybe we need something totally different.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1899.614s">Do</a> we have a way of knowing which of these fees bring in what amount of money? <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1905.377s">Or</a> which categories of fees bring in what amount of money?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2086.907s">I</a> just had a question because it sounds like what the attorney is saying is that according to our laws, we only have the ability to give permission for these food trucks on public ways and all the other entities like the parks and the schools do their own <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2112.372s">food</a> truck licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2114.173s">What</a> it sounds like Councilor Scarpelli is saying is that this is not the practice that we have done, and it is also perhaps not what our former city solicitor said. <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2123.9s">So</a> to me, that makes things a little muddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2129.484s">And</a> I would love to have, I mean, maybe that's just the reality, but if there can be any clarification on that, I think it would help us understand.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_wtwrOMEbog0/2024-06-01_wtwrOMEbog0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-19-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4454.926s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4456.127s">I</a> appreciate all the work that has been done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4458.85s">I</a> just want to comment a little bit about what I saw when I was campaigning and what I have also seen here in these chambers and heard people speak about, which is that when people do not trust <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4471.522s">the</a> way, when they don't understand how their money is being spent, and they don't trust the way that that money is being used, then they never want to give the city another penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4482.628s">So</a> when you combine lack of transparency with underfunding, which I believe is what has happened to Medford over many, many years, what happens is you have a breakdown of democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4493.034s">So</a> to me, making sure that the public <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4496.776s">through</a> this budget ordinance has access to seeing and understanding how are the money that comes into the city is spent, and to know that that money is being spent on things that they are in fact seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4510.082s">I</a> think this is going to help not only <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4512.603s">the</a> way that we move the budget forward, but it's also gonna help get people to understand that, yes, the city is or is not, you know, whatever we find, right, when we've got this transparency, using the funds wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4527.789s">And</a> I think we will also see that there's genuine underfunding of most city departments.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6220.118s">I</a> just wanted to ask if you have run this by the Community Development Board as well as the Office of Planning.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6799.192s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6799.992s">I</a> just wanted to mention that I do have a friend who lives in one of these <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6805.916s">cooperatively</a> owned buildings in Boston, and he raves about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6810.938s">So</a> I'd be excited to talk about that as an affordable housing possibility as well.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_4GMpYr5oF1s/2024-06-01_4GMpYr5oF1s.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 03-13-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=376.092s">Sorry,</a> I do have a clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=377.474s">I</a> just want to make sure we're talking about an email newsletter specifically, or do you mean more broadly the sense of a newsletter that could be email and other things as well?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=399.965s">I</a> just didn't know whether when you said the word newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=402.287s">No,</a> that's a great clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=403.729s">That</a> you meant the email part of it, or if you were talking more broadly.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=442.128s">on</a> the second, but also a question.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=447.092s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=447.893s">Um,</a> so I I'm assuming that this, um, sort of voluntary sign up will be available to all because and not just those are this committee.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=634.964s">This</a> is how we do it, if it comes to me for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=637.565s">No,</a> it's great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=640.766s">So</a> it seems to me that in addition to an email, like having our own email list, specifically because of the laws around opt-in, that any list really should, if you want to have an email list, then you'll have to be opt-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=658.909s">If</a> we want for people to be able to get access to this information, they should be able to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=664.611s">They</a> should also be able to follow a social media account on their preferred social media platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=668.872s">So</a> I want you to reread that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=674.094s">But</a> to me, that sounds a little vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=676.995s">The</a> language, I wasn't sure exactly what you meant by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=679.196s">And</a> I wonder if we can <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=681.954s">very</a> specifically have something that's more talking about the creation of, um, followable distribution platforms, which would include things like an email list that people can opt into, um, a, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=699.124s">you</a> know, an X account, a YouTube account, you know, blah, blah, blah, like accounts on those specific platforms.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=719.158s">I'm</a> sorry, what's the third motion?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=762.33s">When</a> you say that, it might take a while to set up.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1210.676s">Just</a> I was going to answer the question.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1524.189s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1525.15s">I</a> agree with both of y'all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1526.35s">And</a> I just wanted to add that I'm probably even more excited to put into the newsletter things that are upcoming than things that already passed, because that allows for people in the community to participate in the decisions to be involved in engaging in democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1543.801s">So</a> those are difficult to spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1546.382s">We</a> simply just state what is coming up and what is going to be on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1550.225s">And</a> that way, people will know <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1552.626s">when</a> to come if they want to speak out about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1554.307s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1734.27s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1734.81s">Um,</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1737.452s">I</a> assume this is because I only had four hours of sleep, although it could also be because you only had four hours of sleep when you wrote these. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1743.796s">But</a> I didn't fully understand the first three motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1749.079s">And</a> if it's okay with you, because, hey, we're in a body where words matter, do you mind reading those slowly? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1755.583s">And</a> I think I will probably make slight amendments just to the wording to make sure that that wording is easily understood by everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1761.506s">Is</a> that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1762.106s">One</a> at a time.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1803.181s">The</a> only thing for me is the word newsletter to me, it means email newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1807.105s">So</a> I wonder if we can call it a communications plan or communications or I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1814.092s">I</a> don't know if there's a better word and if everybody else thinks it's fine, that's fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1818.696s">But</a> like I was confused when I really thought you meant an email newsletter.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1852.955s">That</a> just, that just feels like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1857.83s">I</a> think that's difficult because... If you guys understand it, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1860.613s">To</a> me, it meant something different from what you meant.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1894.914s">What</a> if we say monthly newsletter content?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1928.328s">and</a> when we will have perhaps left a little bit more.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1941.257s">Yeah,</a> I didn't realize.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1978.091s">As</a> long as it specifically includes any city councilor, not just this <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1982.014s">Okay,</a> I'll make sure that yeah, beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1984.696s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1985.116s">Love</a> it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2036.554s">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2037.294s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2037.935s">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2038.876s">And</a> so it is.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2061.081s">Love</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2062.622s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2067.525s">That</a> does it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2095.464s">Oh,</a> I was just going to say like, you know, if the mayor helps distribute or any of these other email lists agrees, then what they do is they don't just distribute our content as if it's theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2104.547s">They</a> say, you know, sign up here, like here's the content sign up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2109.589s">And</a> that gives everyone on their list the opportunity to opt in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2683.106s">really</a> make an effort to be on all of those platforms, because that's kind of the point, is that each platform has its own subset of people that actually check that platform and prefer that platform to other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2693.974s">I</a> think we should not neglect to at least consider texting, WhatsApp, discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2705.924s">These</a> are things, so especially like texting and WhatsApp are used by a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2711.405s">less</a> affluent immigrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2714.788s">And</a> so if we don't even discuss them, and I understand that texting probably would cost us money, but if we don't at least consider those, I think that we are sort of blocking off certain people to engagement and specifically people who tend to be the least engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2733.04s">So</a> I would love for us to consider those as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3220.417s">I</a> apologize, I will have to leave in nine minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3224.159s">I</a> move that we join these and approve them.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3407.844s">I</a> can be that person creating a paper to report and putting on the agenda at some point?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3412.208s">All</a> right, yeah, I better.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1665.765s">I'm</a> just gonna throw in one thing that I've heard from some constituents, and I think we should also think carefully about because it does seem like a post pandemic request, but folks who have been working from home would, folks that I've heard from would really appreciate having a mini office space that they could go to that's very close to their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1688.042s">And</a> I don't know if that's another thing we could think about as a possible zoning is having these micro pockets of, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1696.143s">you</a> know, tiny office space, like, you know, one of these spaces where you just rent a desk, tiny micro office space, coffee shop, lunch place, something like that, which would allow people to sort of start getting out of their homes who currently don't have to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1717.137s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3385.785s">do</a> you think we can do both? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3390.066s">Just</a> timing wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3390.806s">I</a> think economic development and climate put them both on the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3394.447s">I</a> guess we can always, if we don't get them covered, we can always put them up.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2819.198s">As</a> far as the question of getting proper budgetary information out of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2825.921s">I</a> believe that's an entirely separate discussion, I agree that that's a big problem, and we as a city council have been working. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2833.764s">I</a> even before I got on the city council to make sure that that's a more transparent process that the mayor is asked <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2840.547s">and</a> has been asked repeatedly and now has to follow a schedule to provide information this is something that this city council and the city council before me has worked very hard on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2849.494s">So</a> this is not something that we are ignoring this is something we are working very hard to make sure happens, but it is a totally separate issue from whether <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2858.241s">we</a> have 12 month availability of free cash, essentially, or if we only have free cash after it has been certified, which can take six to nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2867.527s">So</a> that is what this question is, is a question of whether we have, as a city, have availability of that free cash for 12 months, or whether we have availability for that free cash only after it has been certified six to nine months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2882.878s">I</a> completely agree with many of the people who spoke here that the city <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2888.562s">The</a> roads are in terrible condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2891.144s">Our</a> school buildings are in terrible condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2893.606s">Our</a> school budget is not anywhere near large enough for the amount of teachers that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2900.852s">I</a> completely agree with those sentiments and that reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2906.156s">I</a> believe that it's because of decades of underfunding of this city, because that is why the roads have come to the point where they have come, and why the school buildings have come to the point where they have come. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2916.345s">That</a> is also a separate issue from the question of whether we have year round access to essentially free cash, or whether we can cannot access that free cash for the first six to nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2929.211s">So,</a> to me, this really is a question simply of whether, and I appreciate cancer Scarpelli for your consideration for the newer city Councilors of which I am one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2942.401s">I</a> would not mind a little bit more time to understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2945.662s">But</a> I will say that it seems quite clear to me that, first of all, we're not taxing anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2955.926s">We're</a> not increasing the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2958.227s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2959.087s">This</a> literally does not have to do anything with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2963.809s">It</a> converts free cash from something that we cannot access to something that we can access. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2969.111s">And</a> that free cash is literally <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2972.092s">what</a> happens when the income that comes into the city and the budget that goes out of the city, the actual spent budget that goes out of the city differ, which they have to do, or else you don't have a bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2984.155s">So</a> understanding the budget of the city and how it functions, I do believe that creating this fund is the smart thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2995.437s">And</a> I'm willing to vote on this tonight.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4395.899s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4396.66s">Yes,</a> I know that on that lot right now, there are a lot of wonderful tall trees that block the busy Broadway street from those other streets that are a little bit further in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4411.05s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about the proposed green space and whether there will continue to be trees there or be new trees planted, aside from the pocket park?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4447.197s">They're</a> quite lovely and tall.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6688.517s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9719.486s">I</a> am going to reiterate what has been already said a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9723.727s">All</a> we are voting on tonight is whether we are allowed to discuss this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9729.509s">So</a> anything that comes before us has to get a number and go to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9734.98s">That's</a> how we start the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9737.064s">That's</a> how we have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9738.847s">That's</a> how we also continue to get public input as we craft any sort of legislation of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9746.754s">We</a> literally don't have a single word written about what kind of transfer fee we would do because we can't until we get a number and we send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9755.0s">And</a> this is going to take months because we're going to take a lot of input from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9759.603s">So</a> as far as having a well-functioning democracy and being able to discuss important issues, this is how it starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9768.129s">We're</a> only voting on whether we can discuss this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9771.07s">So</a> that is what we're voting on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9773.771s">I</a> also really want people to have a little bit of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9778.653s">I</a> know way too much about state politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9782.035s">And</a> I can tell you that of any communities that have passed a real estate transfer fee, as with many other housing related issues, the state does not approve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9794.52s">So</a> what is going to happen <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9797.677s">is</a> if we are lucky enough to pass anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9802.557s">that</a> is related to a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9804.978s">It</a> will not be approved by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9808.399s">The</a> only thing likely to come out through the state is what is gonna be very similar to Governor Healey's proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9816.102s">Governor</a> Healey's proposition, just so you know, is 1% on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9823.724s">Nothing</a> will affect anyone who sells a house less than a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9829.068s">And</a> the only tax is on what is over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9832.33s">So</a> if you sell your house for $1.1 million, the total tax for you is $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9837.312s">So,</a> you know, I hope I can assuage some people's fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9842.835s">And</a> I really hope that we can have a respectful discussion tonight and that you all can participate in our many months long discussion that we hopefully will be about to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9854.54s">that</a> will happen in perfectly open committee meetings, which we invite you all to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9859.586s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15478.303s">Thanks,</a> just point of personal privilege and I appreciate the opportunity in case other folks, maybe I misspoke or people didn't understand what I said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15486.525s">I</a> was not saying that if we pass something like this, it will never get through the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15490.606s">What</a> I was saying is that the likelihood that our version, that any version we pass is different from Governor Healey's version is very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15500.689s">And</a> what that means is that it will be a 1% tax <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15504.25s">on</a> buyer or seller, it will only affect homes over a million dollars and only the amount of money over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15510.196s">That</a> was the reason that I brought up how difficult it is to pass through the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15513.62s">And</a> thank you for giving me the opportunity to restate that.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2204.85s">I'm</a> sorry, I do have one question.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2207.351s">Is</a> there, for example, if there were creative ideas that came from the community about how we can support our local small businesses, is there some sort of a fund where small amounts of money like $2,000, $4,000, those kinds of things can come out of?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2242.004s">I</a> would request there be a small slush fund for, you know, creative events and other ideas that can help our local small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2252.111s">We're</a> talking like 10k maybe for an entire year, just very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2263.28s">You</a> know, we're talking small, but you could do some interesting events and things with 10K. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2268.023s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3891.693s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3893.073s">So</a> I hear this sort of coming up with five. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3897.655s">I'm</a> curious, what do our <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3901.815s">boil</a> down recommendations look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3903.857s">Are</a> we supposed to come up with five? <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3905.378s">It</a> doesn't say anything about that in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3910.543s">What</a> are we expecting this to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3912.684s">How</a> many is too many? <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3915.627s">What</a> do we want?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4221.135s">I</a> wanted to ask, should I email mine, or is it okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4224.718s">Do</a> you have reasonable notes from what I said?<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_QyOHt10oLs0/2024-06-01_QyOHt10oLs0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 02-21-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=983.172s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1776.095s">Yeah,</a> could we say, you know, the user of the leaf blower?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3601.011s">Yeah,</a> just wanted to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3603.192s">But</a> in addition to there being plenty of studies showing that over the life of the product, it is environmentally more responsible to use electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3611.496s">It</a> should be noted that battery technology changes and changes fairly quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3617.338s">So</a> when we're talking about lithium batteries, the design of an electric leaf blower is different from the design of a gas powered leaf blower. <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3626.262s">And</a> if we <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3627.603s">convert</a> now to electric as battery technology improves, we will be able to more easily get the benefit of those new batteries, which, you know, I'm sure will be environmentally more sustainable because people are not quite aware of the problems with lithium batteries.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10399.309s">Thank</a> you, and thanks so much to everyone who has come tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10404.172s">I</a> consider myself to be a pro-worker and pro-union person, and I know that there are other Councilors on this council who agree with that statement about themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10417.4s">I</a> think the absolute minimum that we can do if we are pro-worker, pro-union people, is to not make this permanent change <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10427.208s">to</a> essentially at will employment based solely on flimsy corporate arguments and a totally unproven allegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10437.491s">So</a> from the arguments standpoint, I have heard a number of things tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10444.899s">and</a> things like this process should not be hamstrung by all sorts of bureaucratic blah blah blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10455.909s">It</a> sure is real simple when you can fire anybody for no reason and <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10464.113s">Process</a> is something that helps us have good democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10467.475s">It</a> helps us have good workplaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10470.597s">I</a> do not think that this argument of needing to have a quick process is one that I would agree with or that vibes with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10480.443s">This</a> idea that we need leadership that is most qualified, that we're going to find the best candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10485.066s">I</a> talked at length with firefighters who described the process, the civil service process, and believe me, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10493.47s">Having</a> a mayor select someone is not merit-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10497.996s">If</a> you want the best candidate or most qualified candidate, then you're going to go with a civil service process because that in fact is totally merit-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10510.625s">And</a> this question that this decision does not affect other people in the department is, frankly, totally not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10519.691s">It</a> is true to say that it does not remove those other people from civil service, but it totally affects them, aside from the fact that all these promotions, you know, would, you know, waterfall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10533.78s">and</a> affect a lot of people every time there would be a new fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10540.243s">That,</a> of course, is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10541.284s">But</a> if you want to know if it affects the department, look around the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10544.465s">It</a> affects the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10545.826s">Why</a> else are all of these people here? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10547.747s">And</a> as far as the allegation, you know, I am very concerned that we are being pushed into this decision based on <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10558.152s">a</a> totally unproven allegation that the mayor herself says she doesn't even have any idea why these people would do a coordinated sick out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10569.496s">Now,</a> people don't do a coordinated, like, they don't through their union coordinate to all be sick at the same time without a demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10577.278s">You</a> don't, like, that just isn't the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10580.96s">And</a> the other thing about being sick is that, you know, diseases are contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.283s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.783s">So</a> people all get sick at the same time when they work in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10591.385s">That</a> is normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10593.526s">And</a> you can think what you want about that particular instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10597.488s">But</a> whatever you think, there is no proven anything going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10603.37s">And</a> this is not the time for us to make this kind of decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10608.973s">It</a> also I really have to urge Councilors to understand that there is not one firefighter that is in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10617.76s">And</a> I am, again, as I said at the beginning, really boggles my mind how we could possibly improve our fire department with leadership that they themselves will refuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10629.569s">It</a> simply does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10633.112s">So</a> I am not in favor of this, and I don't think that it helps us to move this to a committee where we'll discuss it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10642.338s">I</a> have made my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10644.1s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1447.196s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1448.037s">Just</a> to finish up, I'm someone who thinks very deeply and has for seven or eight years thought very deeply about how to engage people who are not currently engaged in city politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1462.556s">I'm</a> not worried that if we send it to some people, there are people who aren't getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1467.438s">I</a> think that's the way all newsletters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1469.479s">You</a> start with with the people who you know you can access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1473.721s">And</a> I think this kind of update is <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1478.143s">just</a> trying to get a certain piece of information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1481.725s">The</a> question of how do you engage more people, I think, is something that we reach differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1486.708s">That's</a> not what we discuss now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1488.289s">That's</a> what we discussed specifically when we were discussing, hey, how do we reach those people and bring them into any of these discussions? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1497.435s">To</a> me, that's what the meetings with underrepresented groups is really <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1501.838s">dedicated</a> to as well as the community liaisons and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1505.599s">So</a> I'm not, I'm not really concerned about, you know, having a newsletter that does not go to every single person in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1511.162s">I</a> think you start, you know, that's how newsletters are, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1513.202s">You</a> start with what you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1515.663s">I</a> just, I would love it if we can also talk to the communications department and see if that's one of the avenues that, you know, we can sort of fold this into if it's something nice and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1526.027s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2978.706s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=732.959s">public</a> works facilities convened, and we have discussed ways that we can keep up to date on the roads and sidewalks, as well as all of the buildings that the city owns in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=745.567s">We</a> are excited to keep the public informed of how these efforts are moving forward with the administration.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2492.194s">Councilor</a> Leming spoke quite well on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2495.297s">Really,</a> this is a, remember, this is a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2497.579s">This</a> is not an ordinance that we are passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2499.661s">This</a> is a statement of the views of the council on not prioritizing our law enforcement to spend resources, to arrest and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2515.336s">you</a> know, sent for incarceration, people who simply have possession of such controlled substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2524.26s">So</a> given that and what Councilor Leming said, I believe this resolution is a fairly reasonable state and there are many other cities that have passed something very similar.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3326.24s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3327.361s">As</a> a co sponsor of this, it clearly is important to me that we do consider the spirit of what we're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3337.052s">But</a> I also want to mention that this is a fairly long resolution, and it includes a couple of state <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3344.076s">recommendations</a> about state policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3346.437s">And</a> I want to ensure that other Councilors have had the time to consider those policies and to consider the entire text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3355.122s">And</a> that I also mentioned this because I am the first in the alphabet, which means that I have to state what I'm going to do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3364.307s">And</a> that's simply to say to my fellow Councilors that I would definitely respect people's desires to have time and committee <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3373.001s">to</a> understand the issue more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3374.723s">And</a> I will, as a co-sponsor, make sure that this does move through committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3379.968s">But</a> I just want to state that I'd love to hear from other Councilors in terms of whether sending it to committee is something that you would prefer.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4310.791s">Because</a> I work for a 501C3 organization that takes a position on a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, among other things, I have filed a disclosure form with the city clerk, but I have been advised by the State Ethics Commission that I am able to vote on this issue.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14683.914s">I</a> just wanted to mention for anyone watching, listening or in the chambers that this is a resolution that simply sends it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14690.077s">This</a> is an opening of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14691.978s">So</a> if people are interested in this topic, please come to the committee meetings where this will be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14697.541s">Same</a> with the warming center, same with some of these other resolutions that were passed today and maybe passed later today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14703.524s">This</a> is really the beginning of the discussion, certainly not the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14707.246s">And</a> we really encourage people to come to those committee meetings because that is where the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14711.508s">you</a> know, meat and potatoes of developing laws for our city comes from.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15972.526s">I</a> just wanted to mention that in one of the committees, perhaps you can remind me which one, we were talking about the importance of holding companies accountable for any damages that they do, or for following through on their promises of things that they've committed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15987.636s">And</a> I see this as part of that ongoing work, but we will be, as a city, we will be doing more to be proactive about these kinds of things.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16239.453s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16240.254s">Um,</a> yes, as I mentioned earlier today in this committee, we have discussed getting updates from the administration on roads on sidewalks and on all publicly owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16253.719s">We</a> also have a new facilities manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16256.0s">So</a> we feel this is a really nice way for them to get <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16262.563s">themselves</a> situated in terms of what all of the city owned buildings are, what state of repair they're in, how much might cost to repair them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16270.765s">So,</a> this is just something that we're, you know, putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16275.867s">And</a> we think that it will both be beneficial to the city and also be beneficial to the facilities manager.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16500.163s">This</a> resolution really is all about just getting the information that we need to make decisions like that in the future.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16848.967s">I</a> was just gonna say, I worked on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16852.348s">I'm</a> in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16854.909s">I</a> do, as a general rule, I think councilors should take time to understand everything in everything that we pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16862.552s">And</a> I know that there's some state laws involved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16866.313s">And</a> that's why I just wanted to know, but I'm perfectly happy to pass tonight.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FrIQvitIEmA/2024-06-01_FrIQvitIEmA.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 01-31-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=32.107s">Sorry,</a> I cannot hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=33.388s">Can</a> you move the thing onto the podium, maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=35.088s">Yeah,</a> good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=37.51s">With</a> air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=38.45s">Is</a> this better?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=316.247s">I</a> just was hoping that we can, for all of these, have a status in each of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=322.152s">I</a> think it's super helpful to have a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=323.934s">So</a> even zoning reform, it's helpful for us, but also for the public to know, oh, there was zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=331.96s">There</a> was a minor zoning reform that happened last cycle, but we expect to be doing more major zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=341.82s">But</a> I think even for any of the ordinances and things, even if it's not started, it would be great to have a status put in there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=359.951s">So</a> status being things like not started, <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=366.926s">proposed,</a> like I don't know what they all are going to be, but like a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=371.048s">And</a> if there's anything that can be easily put into like a short sentence for people to give people any context around that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=576.615s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=577.115s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=578.276s">Would</a> it be helpful under descriptions and goals if we actually <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=584.491s">called</a> out housing production plan section 5B to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the climate action plan 2.2.D, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=595.414s">So</a> rather than these generic implement Medford Comprehensive Plan, which even I who have read the Medford Comprehensive Plan don't, that's so vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=606.036s">Would</a> that be a helpful way for us to have a full list, even though I know that would be long? <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=613.354s">Is</a> there a way for us to maybe each of us take things that we're like, I'm trying to figure out how we can break this into chunks to make it into like a list of things that we actually want to accomplish.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2249.682s">So</a> these are definitely out of the climate adaptation and action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2258.028s">Really,</a> the energy disclosure and benchmarking are kind of linked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2262.93s">So</a> what other cities have done is to first start with having buildings, usually large buildings above a certain amount, have required energy disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2279.114s">And</a> then after that, after they've been doing that for a few years, then the city can benchmark certain energy goals and have fines for buildings that are not meeting those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2295.804s">So</a> it is definitely part of the same, it would be part of, I believe, the same ordinance that would have one thing for a few years and then benchmarking part of it for the next few years.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2425.852s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2426.332s">You</a> just reminded me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2427.193s">I</a> also had a talk with Brenda and Alicia about this and heard that the state may be working on something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2435.24s">The</a> state's version will only apply to very large buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2439.704s">I</a> think our first step is really to investigate, number one, what the state is working on and number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2447.449s">how</a> quickly that might be done, because being someone who actually knows quite a lot about how state politics works, I know that it could be 10 or 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2455.491s">So</a> we need to understand whether they're actually going to accomplish something or if this is just something that is, you know, quote unquote, being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2462.233s">And</a> then number three, if whatever law they are working on is even going to have any impact in Medford, given the size of most of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2471.314s">And</a> if not, then we want to consider what could we do that might be like a slightly smaller building size or how we could have impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2480.996s">I'm</a> super passionate about this because two thirds of our emissions are from buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2486.497s">And</a> so this is really and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2491.198s">There's</a> like a half a percent gain in buildings per year, maybe, maybe less. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2495.819s">So</a> we cannot affect this carbon emissions through new buildings and new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2501.143s">Yes,</a> there's new construction on old buildings, but if we really want to get at our carbon emissions, this is something we'll have to consider.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2537.446s">Yep,</a> I can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2538.847s">It's</a> basically something that will allow us to reach both some of our climate goals as well as some of our affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2545.57s">It</a> just means that if you're a landlord renting units that you would have to register with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2551.874s">Pretty</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2553.555s">Councilor</a> Tseng?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2832.009s">Sure</a> this energy retrofits for existing buildings is really right out of the climate action adaptation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2838.792s">It's</a> supposed to be something that the planning department is doing this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2844.417s">Maybe</a> started last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2846.239s">I</a> think they're actually going to start this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2848.04s">So</a> I think we just want to have our eyes on it and ensure that that effort is moving forward.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=578.01s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=579.171s">I</a> love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=580.892s">I</a> might suggest that we add to this motion that we have a report back not only on the pavement management, <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=588.539s">study,</a> which is specifically roads, but there's also a sidewalk study. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=592.56s">So</a> maybe that belongs in it and then maybe a separate motion for a comparison of the price of having our own sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=603.684s">And</a> yeah.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=786.718s">Councilor</a> Zero.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=823.065s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=823.425s">Is</a> there more discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=824.125s">Do</a> people feel comfortable, even though this is a very long motion, do people feel comfortable voting on the motion?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=853.351s">But</a> I believe that currently we're only considering your motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=856.992s">Oh,</a> OK.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=864.312s">Great,</a> any more discussion on the first motion of President Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=869.854s">All</a> in favor?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=985.602s">Does</a> it go boing?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=995.908s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=996.248s">Any</a> more discussion on this motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=998.709s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1001.953s">All</a> in favor?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1003.494s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1004.554s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1006.474s">Great,</a> let's go ahead and breeze through some of these other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1010.055s">We</a> have one under City Facilities and Equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1012.216s">Is</a> there anyone who wants to speak on this one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1400.094s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1402.256s">I</a> completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1403.517s">I</a> think having some sort of assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1408.54s">And</a> I do think that if with a new facilities manager, that is exactly the time for them to be given a task like this, as long as they have enough time, because it really sets them on the right path of being aware of all of our facilities and the shape that each one of them is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1422.551s">It'll</a> help them to get all that information on board quickly.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1429.498s">Any</a> other discussion around this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1433.18s">Moving</a> on to public restrooms in Parks and Squares, and Councilor Tseng is not here, but it is fairly self-descriptive, just developing plans to have more public restrooms in our parks and squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1448.31s">Moving</a> on to ordinances, is there any discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1450.631s">We're</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1453.313s">Ordinances,</a> the lead ordinance, Councilor Beres, do you want to introduce this one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1510.905s">Any</a> discussion?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1521.886s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1522.446s">Moving</a> on to a homeown petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1526.51s">This</a> is Vice President Collins taking the lead on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1530.333s">Is</a> there anyone that wants to introduce this one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1537.879s">That's</a> what rings in my head.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1612.103s">Any</a> other discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1615.094s">Moving</a> on to the oversight and engagement, public utility accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1621.781s">Cerulli</a> is looking at holding utility companies accountable to provide services and benefits to the community and mitigate impact of their assets and poor asset condition on the city.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1871.798s">Thank</a> you for mentioning that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1873.919s">It</a> also reminds me that I heard this same thing that you say that you have heard for many years I also heard this talking to neighbors at their doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1884.523s">And</a> also I wonder if we can fold into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1887.745s">to</a> understand from the administration how much coordination there is, because in some other cities, they put a moratorium once a road is truly repaved and brought up to like a number one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1902.384s">And</a> my understanding is that then there are a lot of emergencies, and that this happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1907.268s">So</a> to really have an understanding from the administration of what that moratorium is, what can get in the way of it, how often it happens, that, in fact, it's torn up much more quickly than every five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1919.598s">So</a> I think that might fold into that, or it could be separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1922.68s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2251.823s">So</a> there, yes, Councilor Lazzaro?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2336.151s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli has a motion on the floor and as we read it back, if you wanna, no, no, just let me know if you think it makes any sense to add in something about the moratorium and how often it is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2349.059s">So</a> let's go ahead and read that back.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2389.051s">Do</a> we want to have a second for this motion?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2398.577s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2400.378s">We</a> can always add my stuff as a different motion or something.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2422.818s">Any</a> more discussion on the Councilor Scarapelli's motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2426.943s">All</a> in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2427.863s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2428.344s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2429.344s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2432.786s">Great,</a> we are near the end here.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2485.29s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2487.671s">All</a> right, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2488.411s">Already?</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2505.719s">Do</a> you want to read that back, and then we'll take a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2508.341s">We'll</a> have a discussion and vote.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2522.78s">Any</a> discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2524.901s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2525.401s">All</a> in favor?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2527.682s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2528.942s">The</a> final thing on our list is simply the tree planting volunteer network. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2535.185s">That</a> is really something that we're at a very early phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2538.629s">We're</a> just at the point of like talking to city staff and kind of seeing, you know, they're like talking to city staff and also looking at what other cities have done just to get an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2550.824s">So</a> we're not, I think, at the point of any kind of an ordinance or taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2556.271s">So</a> the idea is that the city would allow certain volunteers, residents to, with training, with the proper placement, with the proper trees, with the proper depth, and with all the training to be enabled to participate in the planting of certain city trees.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2629.397s">Great,</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2630.578s">And</a> I do think also that as a, like if this becomes something of a resolution or who knows what exactly it will become, that it will be for, it's kind of stopgap measure, that the purpose really is to have a larger tree planting crew, but that at the moment, while we are dealing with budgetary difficulties, that this might be able to help us to increase our tree canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2653.08s">President</a> Bears?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2807.889s">Does</a> anybody have an idea for what is the next step for this?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2858.309s">Do</a> we have any other public comment, any discussion of anything else as we've reached the end of our sort of list of things that we hope to cover in this committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2879.887s">What</a> we were just talking about just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2884.5s">Oh,</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2886.161s">Yes,</a> 19-554, resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2894.604s">It</a> was discussed.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2898.786s">I</a> did not call it from my chair.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2913.696s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2914.476s">Please</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2918.737s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2919.898s">Can</a> you state your name and address for the record?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3161.587s">I</a> think that our clerk actually has some some answers for you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3264.821s">Well,</a> unfortunately, I think that the reason this has been stalled for six years is because it's really up to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3269.591s">This</a> is not something that we can decide and our administration can implement.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3315.1s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3318.644s">No,</a> we can't because it's really up to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3320.365s">So</a> we don't have any control over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3322.645s">So</a> what we're suggesting is that we reach out again to our state representatives to ask them for some information, but it's nothing that we are able to.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3336.79s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3343.052s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3344.193s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3491.788s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3615.58s">OK,</a> all rants aside, cut you off, President Perkins.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3627.697s">Is</a> there any other discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3629.938s">No,</a> there's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3630.598s">Does</a> anyone move to adjourn?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2826.015s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2826.675s">I'm</a> going to bring up another idea that I heard while I was knocking on doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2830.678s">This</a> is not at the point of writing an ordinance yet, but simply at the point of having discussions with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2837.103s">Someone</a> asked if we could pass something allowing folks to have chickens in their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2841.586s">And</a> I know that the way other cities do it, it's a certain number per lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2847.251s">or</a> nine blocks or whatever that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2850.173s">So</a> it's not like anyone can have as many chickens as they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2852.754s">So,</a> but again, not ordinance stage, simply curiosity because someone mentioned it when I was knocking on their door to see if this is something that the people in Medford are interested in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3251.637s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3252.997s">Again,</a> I'm excited to dig into these and to work with the committee to prioritize these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3260.24s">I</a> do want to say I'm happy to put the public utility accountability if you want to put my name as the lead councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3265.002s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3266.243s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3267.984s">I'm</a> also really grateful for seeing the lead ordinance on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3271.823s">That</a> was on all of my original material that I knocked on doors with in May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3277.726s">So</a> I'm very happy to see that there. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3280.808s">Yeah,</a> that's it for me.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3459.192s">I</a> just wanna make sure that people, that we understood you correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3461.674s">You're</a> talking about municipal energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3464.037s">It</a> says you broke up a little bit right then. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3465.398s">Renewable</a> energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3466.639s">Renewable</a> energy or municipal energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3470.923s">I</a> think he was talking about municipal energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3474.306s">Yeah,</a> which I think is very exciting.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4014.372s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4015.533s">And</a> I so appreciate this being brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4020.39s">Given</a> our discussion right now, and discussions that I had many times at people's doors over the summer and fall, I would love to organize one meeting of this Public Works and Facilities Committee that is devoted to discussing private ways with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4040.829s">Hopefully</a> we can have a lot of lead time. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4043.533s">We</a> can also come up with some written understanding of the history of private ways, how they became what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4053.957s">I</a> would love to do something like that, so I don't think we'll do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4059.681s">It's</a> something that will require a lot of preparation for, but I do think that that would be beneficial for our community, for people to be able to come and discuss the issue as a whole with each other.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4206.548s">I</a> would lean toward a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4208.938s">A</a> debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4210.519s">Like</a> a real big public campaign for a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4213.661s">Everybody</a> knows exactly what it's for and the public gets to decide whether or not to do that for the people who live in the city and yet do not get a lot of the services that everybody else gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4224.649s">Really</a> could be a question of equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4228.211s">And</a> then the voters are deciding and we're not doing anything that is not, we're not making the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4234.395s">Voters</a> are making the decision.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4247.751s">Is</a> that the $64 million question?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4509.735s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4510.435s">As</a> I was looking through our whole governing framework, I noticed that there wasn't any obvious place to put a lot of the revitalizing our squares work. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4522.537s">And</a> I thought about the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee as a good place where we might be able to do some of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4528.778s">I</a> know some of our neighboring cities have, they actually have city run offices that can help local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4536.78s">They</a> have grants for <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4538.24s">you</a> know, both exterior and interior design. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4541.481s">They</a> have trainings in, you know, how to, you know, run, you know, employment, and how to run a business, all sorts of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4552.964s">And</a> I think that's, I heard so many times from people that we really want to be revitalizing our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4559.625s">So</a> one, it's just really a question if there is another place aside from zoning, which I know is going to be, you know, obvious, that's more obvious place. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4566.647s">but</a> if this seems like the right place to put some of those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4570.61s">And</a> then I would love to offer that I will go ahead and make some suggestions for things we might be able to do based on what some other cities have done and ideas that came up during the campaign.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4925.799s">I</a> simply wanted to address Councilor George, I mean, Councilor Scarpelli, and say that we miss your cheerful disposition in the chambers.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5004.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5005.158s">So,</a> when I was reading this after action report, I assumed that it would include some explanation of the things that had gone wrong, and why they had gone wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5017.744s">And</a> I, I just don't see anything like that in here I see a lot of things like, you know, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5024.082s">As</a> Councilor Scarpelli said, we often have these results by 9pm, and yet we didn't have the results until 1 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5033.371s">And</a> rather than any sort of explanation of why that happened, it says all ballots must be counted on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5039.482s">The</a> tabulation facility will post the tabulated tapes in the same method as the individual precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5043.766s">Unofficial</a> results will be released once, like there is nothing in here that explains what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5049.05s">So</a> my first question is perhaps I misunderstood what this report was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5053.895s">So</a> I'd like to ask what the report was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5057.258s">And</a> I think it would be incredibly helpful to have some sort of understanding of what it was that actually went wrong because I don't see that in here at all.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8949.141s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8950.121s">It's</a> been 24 years since a school committee has gotten a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8953.343s">I</a> believe that the school committee is overdue for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8956.645s">We</a> need the school committee to be paid enough to ensure that enough people run so that elections are competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8962.908s">We</a> need the pay to be enough to attract people who are less wealthy, people who cannot afford to spend up to 20 hours a week doing something that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8971.332s">you</a> know, doesn't pay or pays very little. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8974.116s">I</a> see raising the school committee salary as a pro-democracy reform along with many other types of pro-democracy reforms that I will mention later. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8982.626s">Reforms</a> that I have presented in communities across the country for seven years that are deeply important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8989.934s">As</a> I said last time, pro-democracy means not just people who are willing or dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8995.118s">It</a> means having people sitting in those seats who represent, for example, the lower 50% of wage earners in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9001.982s">These</a> are not the people who usually run for or win elected office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9006.986s">Pro-democracy</a> reforms usually happen in the next cycle because it is not about paying the people currently sitting in those seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9014.41s">It</a> is about getting diverse people to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9017.774s">Many</a> cities and states have it in their laws that any change in salary for elected officials cannot go into effect within the same electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9027.602s">I</a> did not look hard for these, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9029.344s">So</a> just in three minutes of Google searching, Illinois and Georgia both have state laws for all municipal elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9036.827s">stating</a> that you cannot raise the pay within that electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9041.71s">Even</a> in Massachusetts, and again, no exhaustive search, Watertown and Everett both have city codes that say that any pay increase for school committees specifically must be voted on in the first 18 months of the cycle and cannot take effect until the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9060.103s">On</a> the question of pay parity, I tried to find examples of pay parity between school committees and city councils discussed anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9068.993s">I</a> found almost nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9071.236s">No</a> well-known elected officials, no organizations that I've heard of or haven't heard of discussing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9075.982s">It</a> came up for a vote in Fall River. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9079.125s">a</a> proposal to bring the school committee pay up to the city council pay, it did not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9083.568s">In</a> Worcester, there was one school committee member who wanted for the school committee to be paid the same as city council, but that is not allowed by the city charter, which in Worcester states that the salary for members of the school committee will be equal to 50% of the salary established for members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9101.502s">So</a> unless they change the city charter, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9103.427s">They</a> cannot do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9105.129s">And</a> I will say that across the country, school committees getting paid 50 percent of the city council is pretty standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9112.158s">That</a> doesn't make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9113.7s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9114.561s">But</a> it is the norm. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9119.013s">I</a> also tried to find anyone talking about this issue as one of parity between men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9124.414s">I</a> could not find, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find anyone talking about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9130.996s">I</a> did look up some numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9132.136s">So</a> according to the National School Boards Association, 51% of school board members are men, 49% are women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9140.838s">We</a> should note that this is a much higher percentage of women than in other elected bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9146.32s">28%</a> of Congress is women, 33% of state legislatures are women, 32% of city councils are women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9157.825s">Northampton,</a> which is a pretty progressive city, commissioned a study on compensation for elected officials in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9163.108s">That's</a> a little while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9165.769s">The</a> end result was a recommendation that they pay their city councilors $17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9169.111s">That</a> was a raise for both city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9172.052s">That</a> they pay their school committee members $9,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9174.854s">They</a> have less than half the people living in Northampton as we have in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9179.476s">It</a> was 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9180.677s">I</a> don't think that we should look at those specific numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9183.837s">But</a> it is interesting to note that their commission did have a difference in pay between the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9190.221s">I</a> am not stating that this is right, that school committees across the country are paid approximately 50%, but there appears to be nobody except for us here and in Fall River, even discussing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9212.605s">I</a> believe without a doubt that a pay increase for the Medford School Committee is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9217.546s">I</a> personally believe there are many reasons why it is appropriate that pay increases for any elected officials come take effect the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9228.989s">I</a> would like to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9230.309s">It's</a> somewhat long. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9231.269s">I</a> can email it to the clerk, the president, the vice president, or whoever is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9238.775s">If</a> it is possible to vote on it tonight, that would be great, but if not, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9244.06s">My</a> motion is to send the following pro-democracy reforms to study in the Governance Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9250.565s">Salaries</a> for elected officials, public financing of elections, rank choice voting for single elected offices, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, and allowing non-citizen residents to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9264.165s">along</a> with that, a request that the Governance Committee prioritize the salary discussion and come to a recommendation on this issue before December 31st of 2024, so that the City Council can vote on whether to implement those salaries starting January of 2026, which is the beginning of the next electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9283.861s">Also</a> a request that the Governance Committee consider the following factors in their salary recommendations, in addition to any others they deem important, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9293.018s">getting</a> enough people to run so that elections are competitive, enabling less wealthy people to hold elected office, and gender pay parity.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2690.825s">Whew,</a> wow, so much to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2699.076s">First,</a> I want to say that a number of years ago, the Somerville School Committee, the paraprofessionals were asking to have their salaries raised to, I think it was $25,000 a year, which I can tell you in Somerville, nor here is a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2714.89s">I</a> was outraged that the school committee was like, nope, flat out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2722.125s">wouldn't</a> do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2724.006s">And</a> one of the reasons that they gave was that they were talking to other school committees and the other school committees from other cities didn't want Somerville to raise the wage because, oh no, then it would mean that they would be under pressure to raise the wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2739.393s">And</a> I said right there that it was my, I was incredibly disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2745.635s">They</a> should be proud to be the first city to do the right thing for the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.167s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.888s">So,</a> and I want to start off by saying how much I believe that our paraprofessionals, especially, but also our teachers are underpaid for the work that they do, how incredibly important that work is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2770.643s">You</a> know, I'm boggled by the types of industries that get paid twice as much as teachers, genuinely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2778.89s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2780.31s">That</a> is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2781.751s">And</a> I think, unfortunately, the only way that we are going to get the things that we care about in this city to be properly funded is to increase the total budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2791.219s">Because</a> we're not going to steal from affordable housing stuff to pay the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2795.202s">We're</a> not going to steal from the teachers to pay for putting us in line with our climate change goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2802.227s">We're</a> not going to pay for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2803.868s">We're</a> not going to steal from one thing to pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2805.79s">Our</a> roads, everything is underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2809.551s">We</a> are wildly underfunded in Medford and we have to solve that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2814.152s">So</a> I wanna make sure that we don't come into these detailed arguments that are like, oh, well, we can't spend this $60,000 this way because it's gonna come back and fight and compete with the other 70 things that we could spend $60,000 on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2835.039s">So</a> I wanna talk a little bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2838.971s">the</a> value of having a genuine democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2843.734s">I</a> truly believe, and this is something I've spent like seven years working with experts on, studying, training people around the country in how to get a better democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2853.0s">It's</a> very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2855.081s">I</a> know a fair amount about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2856.642s">So</a> when we talk about getting better representation or good representation on a city council or on a school committee, it is not about getting people who are dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2866.283s">It</a> is about getting people who genuinely not only represent but vote in favor of policies that even the scales. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2875.728s">Our</a> government in America at all levels <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2879.955s">overly</a> supports and overly serves people who are wealthy, people who own property, people who are white collar, people who have white collar jobs, people who are overly educated, people who are white. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2898.742s">And</a> when we talk about having a better democracy, it isn't about getting people who are dedicated.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2912.168s">New</a> city councilor, you gotta correct me on these things.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2921.717s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2924.693s">So</a> having run workshops around the country for many years and having, in these workshops, to create these workshops, I studied with experts, mostly in democracy and specifically in democracy at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2938.984s">So</a> city councils, town councils, more city councils than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2943.148s">And</a> I'm just gonna, I pulled up here something that was from one of my workshops so that people understand that this is in, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2952.535s">like</a> a sphere of things you can do to structurally have a better democracy and better meaning we're not only representing home owning wealthy white people in your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2967.492s">that</a> you are properly representing the people who earn less than 50% of, you know, half the people in the city earn less than 50% of the average wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2976.516s">Okay,</a> that's the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2979.597s">So</a> things that you can do to make your city be better represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2985.639s">are</a> public financing of elections, having district awards, making sure you have vote-by-mail or early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2990.54s">I'm</a> not going to read all of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2991.381s">There's</a> like two dozen of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2993.721s">Are</a> your elections on paper ballots? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2995.202s">Is</a> there a hand-counted audit of at least 1%? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2997.522s">And</a> are your elected officials paid a living wage? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3000.363s">So</a> the problem with this idea that it should be a volunteer effort is that there are lots of people, mostly people who earn less than 50%, less than the average wage in your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3014.875s">that</a> they just can't volunteer 20 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3018.757s">Neither</a> they nor their spouse earns enough money that they are able to spend time with their families and live a decent life and pay their bills, their rent, or their groceries, or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3032.686s">It's</a> not about them not being dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3041.513s">do</a> the job if it doesn't pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3044.395s">And</a> I'm going to say, I don't think any of us on the city council, and I don't want to speak for other people, but in most cities, no one on the city council and no one on the school committee falls into those categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3059.564s">And</a> that's why these people are underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3061.745s">So</a> I care a lot about democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3063.867s">And</a> I genuinely believe that the right thing to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3067.905s">is</a> to increase the pay of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3071.266s">Now,</a> that doesn't mean, that being said, right, I also believe that as a city, as an elected city councilor, it is my style to make a bunch of, to be able to pass a lot of things that materially help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3090.612s">Fix</a> the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3093.748s">make</a> sure all of our positions in the school are properly, that we have people who are second language teachers, that we have after school programs for everyone, that we have these things before we do anything that is either for ourselves or cultural. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3111.747s">That</a> is my style. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3113.369s">So</a> I feel incredibly uncomfortable voting on this as the very first thing that comes up in my term as a city councilor, because that is not the way that I want to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3125.78s">That</a> is not the way that I want to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3129.103s">But</a> I want people to understand that my viewpoint on this is not something that I come to in the last month because this <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3137.196s">particular</a> issue came about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3139.078s">This</a> is a viewpoint that I have held for many years, having worked with many experts on how to get your city to properly serve the underserved, which includes the paraprofessionals and the teachers and the other union workers who work here for the city or in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3157.759s">Those</a> are incredibly important to me, and it's important to me that we serve those people first before we serve ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3163.622s">But</a> it is important because the only way you can sustain a city council or a school committee that makes those right decisions is by paying a little bit more so that we can have people on those bodies who come from those backgrounds and not just people who want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3186.57s">to</a> hope to serve those people, but never actually talk to them because we all live in our own bubbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3191.432s">Okay,</a> stop there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3545.302s">I</a> was only going to ask for the motions to be read more slowly before we vote.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3754.139s">Can</a> you clarify the dollar amounts?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8339.947s">I'm</a> a little bothered by the fact that it looks like in both of these proposals, the final landing pay is more than the lowest paid paraprofessional that I don't feel, unless I'm incorrect about that, that's what it looked like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8355.319s">I</a> won't be voting in favor of anything that puts them above a full-time paraprofessional.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8492.16s">This</a> is to put this to the next meeting.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8502.288s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8745.976s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8749.828s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8749.928s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA/2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA.html">City Council 01-09-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=615.714s">I</a> second it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=937.117s">Lawrence</a> Lepore.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2121.533s">I</a> approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2122.193s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2125.314s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3131.142s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3131.642s">I</a> first wanted to really thank President Bears for all the work that went into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3137.544s">It</a> looks like a really excellent framework that we'll all be able to add to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3141.285s">And</a> I especially wanted to highlight how, like, I think a lot about democracy, and to me, that's engaging people in the political process, and also just engaging people in their own ideas for making Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3152.849s">I</a> think that this document, in terms of the transparency that Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3157.47s">It</a> really allows us because especially with the timelines it allows us to communicate with our residents and to engage them in the process right and I understand that this is not in any way finalized but for example, someone who is really concerned about any of those housing home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3174.419s">that</a> I think a lot of folks in Medford are either for or against, that being able to sort of point out what timeline we think that's going to happen on and when they can get engaged, that is crucial in terms of getting people to engage in the process politically, which I'm very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3192.771s">So</a> thank you so much, President Bears, and thanks to everyone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3195.933s">I</a> really look forward to seeing what everyone adds to this framework so that it can truly become a document that we can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3203.365s">with</a> the public as the plan that we see as our ability to engage the public in what we're doing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4758.871s">Hi,</a> yep, I very much agree that this is important, and we need to protect those residents health and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4767.294s">I</a> would love to hear from President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4769.595s">If</a> you happen to know any sort of just a tiny bit of details about <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4774.337s">Obviously,</a> if this is under state regulations and other cities are passing this, there's going to be, you know, places that the Board of Health will go for the kinds of details about how this might affect, like, small local landlords and the ways in which the sort of, you know, is there funding that is available? <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4795.889s">Is</a> there, you know, how is this sort of effectively done? <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4800.091s">I</a> have not looked into how that is done at the state level or at other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4804.234s">if</a> there's a word or two you could speak to on that point.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5491.476s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5492.937s">I</a> read this section of the state code. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5495.538s">I</a> was very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5496.838s">It's</a> something I talked about on the campaign trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5499.84s">You</a> know, this is something that really just gets right at affordable housing in terms of rentals, and it attacks the problem exactly where it exists, by rewarding those rental properties and those landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5513.902s">who</a> are renting below market rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5516.343s">So</a> that is exactly what we want to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5518.685s">I'm</a> pretty excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5521.086s">I</a> also am excited about the fact that it will just by the fact of doing this, you know, most of the people, the landlords who are renting below market rates tend to be local. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5532.252s">Many</a> of them live here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5534.775s">If</a> not right here in our city, then they're in nearby cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5537.777s">And</a> I think being able to target these tax credits for folks who live here is what I wish we could do if we can legally, if we can find a way to do it legally for Medford residents, I would love to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5546.845s">But</a> I'm also very happy that this will target people who are local, a lot of Medford resident landlords, as well as folks who live in nearby cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5555.073s">So</a> I'm excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5556.094s">I'm</a> excited to discuss it on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5557.835s">So</a> thank you for putting this forward.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6145.864s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6146.364s">So</a> where can we, whether we are city councilors or members of the interested public, where can we find the Wellington Circle Study?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7998.858s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8000.814s">Mr.</a> Brown, I want to commend you for being a model resident of Medford because I am so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8006.696s">I</a> mean, I'm pained to hear that you have been trying to get this done for 10 years, but I am so impressed that you, you know, you're not just complaining about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8016.32s">You</a> are talking deeply about the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8018.841s">You</a> have looked into how it could be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8020.562s">You</a> have looked into the proper surface that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8022.844s">You</a> have looked into what other cities have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8024.725s">You</a> have truly looked at what the solutions should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8029.227s">And</a> I am also very happy to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8031.668s">So</a> I will, you know, in conjunction with Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Mulroney. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8039.193s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8039.793s">Like,</a> I'm happy to help in any way I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8042.134s">And</a> I do, I know this is not a simple <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8045.894s">issue.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8046.594s">But</a> I do hope that Medford can become a city that can respond to people like you, to people who come to us with well-thought-out proposals that they have already dug into the solutions for and already done a lot of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8061.523s">Because</a> the point that that has happened, we really need to be able to say yes to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8066.446s">That</a> is how we engage people in the political process when someone, I mean it's a miracle that you're still here 10 years later, because normally when people come and they propose these well thought out solutions, and they're told no or they simply get nothing, they will go away they never come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8085.532s">the</a> best thing our city can do to take these amazing solutions that are provided by people who genuinely care about a specific issue and to find ways to incorporate those into a solution that we can make happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8099.103s">So</a> I'm really hoping that we can do it, not just for your issue, but more broadly for folks in Medford who want to engage in the political process in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8106.428s">Thank</a> you so much.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=343.835s">Well,</a> let us know when you get those that kind of swag that people can buy because I'm sure we'll sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=349.656s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=350.316s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=352.037s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=352.797s">I'm</a> excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=353.277s">I</a> can't wait to eat there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=355.077s">And</a> I think we'll buy ourselves some and then we'll buy some other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=359.198s">So</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=360.138s">Wonderful</a> to talk to you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=362.438s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jyPSYRIy7sk&t=362.779s">Have</a> a good holiday.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=1.346s">Hi,</a> I have Kenya Alfaro here with the Welcome Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=5.793s">Thanks</a> for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=6.514s">Hi,</a> yes, thank you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=9.078s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=10.461s">Yeah,</a> I would love it if you can just tell us a little bit about the Welcome Project and the community that you serve.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=48.195s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=49.896s">Can</a> you tell us a little bit about how those families have been doing during COVID and even now that we're, what are we, nine months into COVID?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=185.26s">And</a> how can people watching this help? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=188.246s">How</a> can they donate or do other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=190.771s">And</a> then where do those donated funds go?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=263.494s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=264.475s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=264.795s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=265.095s">Thank</a> you so much for the work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=267.756s">And</a> thanks for coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDhRmP_86Kw&t=268.576s">It's</a> always a pleasure.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=5.892s">Hey,</a> everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=7.813s">It</a> is great to be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=9.554s">I'm</a> really excited today to be talking to Molly Kivy, who I met while we were knocking on doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=16.999s">She's</a> a resident of the 34th Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=19.841s">And</a> we are going to be talking about unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=22.702s">As</a> I'm sure everyone watching can understand, unemployment is one of those policies that has really kept tens of thousands of families afloat. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=34.03s">It's</a> unbelievably important to people who have been put out of work by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=41.334s">But</a> it also is in some ways sort of keeping our economy going right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=45.797s">So</a> it's a crucially important program that <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=51.166s">I</a> think most people think it's probably running fine, but it actually has some very deep structural problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=57.894s">And</a> I'm really excited to talk to Molly. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=60.077s">And</a> let's go ahead and bring Molly on now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=72.698s">Fabulous.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=74.418s">First,</a> I would love to just ask you a little bit about why this is so important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=79.96s">When</a> I read through your proposals, I see so much work has gone into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=85.001s">It's</a> really incredible and very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=88.982s">And</a> I would love to hear your story about why this is so important to you and why you've decided to spend so much of your time trying to fix unemployment.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=239.196s">Yeah,</a> it's an incredibly important program and it sounds like you, <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=244.887s">because</a> of your upbringing and the cyclical nature of certain jobs, there are jobs where that's the job, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=253.37s">And</a> it's just a crucially important program. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=258.172s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about what are some of the problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=266.354s">And</a> not too much, we can dive in, but if you can kind of summarize some of the problems at first, then we'll dive in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=346.75s">Yeah,</a> when I first heard that from you, I thought that was crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=349.951s">I</a> had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=350.751s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=477.468s">Is</a> that the part where there's like a cap on the amount that, is that that part you're talking about, that there's a cap on the amount that businesses pay?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=515.428s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=516.249s">Yeah,</a> I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=517.23s">That's</a> the fourth one. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=518.391s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=518.852s">And</a> the fifth one?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=593.57s">So</a> let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=594.37s">I</a> don't know if I can remember the five. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=595.891s">Let</a> me try. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=596.471s">So</a> one is it doesn't pay people enough to get by. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=600.173s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=600.894s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=601.114s">Number</a> two is that <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=604.09s">Number</a> two was something about small businesses paying into more than big businesses, but not the cap, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=610.973s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=611.754s">It's</a> a regressive tax structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=613.275s">It's</a> a regressive tax structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=614.735s">It</a> just by its nature, even without the cap, it's a regressive tax structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=618.617s">Number</a> three is that, I forgot this one.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=631.364s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=632.414s">That's</a> crazy, that just doesn't, it punishes businesses that have to lay off workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=639.599s">Which</a> in the end does not do, just as in punishing people for criminal offenses does not in the end lead to people behaving better, same thing with businesses.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=662.168s">Well,</a> that tells you a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=665.25s">Number</a> four is the cap, but they cap the amount that the salary that gets taxed, and then businesses that pay above that salary, that the tax is not applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=677.298s">And</a> the fifth one, which in some senses is a giant one that affects all sorts of things, is that Massachusetts does not, we don't have money in the funds to pay for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=691.624s">And</a> I'm excited to hear you talk about it, because I only know all of this stuff from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=695.565s">But</a> apparently, because we don't meet these standards, we now don't get interest-free loans. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=705.189s">We</a> now have to pay all this money to, I presume, Wall Street banks. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=710.451s">Just</a> to service the loans, I'm being able to pay for the unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=712.972s">So</a> it's really problematic.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=804.147s">were</a> we already not solvent?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=938.227s">Massachusetts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=939.208s">Ah,</a> the Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=939.828s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=940.208s">So</a> that costs Massachusetts $1.4 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=943.23s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=944.131s">And</a> FUTA, just because I know we're going to be talking about FUTA, it stands for the Federal Unemployment?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=960.4s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=961.62s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=962.36s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=963.341s">Well,</a> I don't know if we want to dive into some of these problems individually, or if you want to start talking about solutions, or maybe both. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=973.184s">Maybe</a> start with one of these that you feel like can be solved and how you might solve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=980.906s">I'm</a> going to let you lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=981.866s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1182.911s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about purchase power? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1186.312s">What</a> does it mean, and what is the definition that makes it not working now, and how would we define it differently to make it work?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1284.636s">That</a> sounds like a simple change, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1290.741s">So</a> 50% or 40% of what they're getting paid is not enough if what they're getting paid is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1296.005s">So</a> we want to just increase the percentage of that that they get through unemployment.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1325.134s">Right,</a> it still complies even though we're in a pandemic, we're literally like tens of millions of people have been thrown out of work and there's no way that those people can all find jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1333.856s">Totally</a> impossible no matter how hard they try. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1335.967s">You're</a> suggesting something that would be great in normal times and absolutely necessary for what is happening to people right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1347.835s">Love</a> it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1409.093s">This</a> is something I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1411.614s">I</a> think that should be done way more often is to say, well, what do the other, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1418.284s">50</a> countries most similar to us do, and if they all do something different, then maybe we're, you know, maybe there's something wrong with the way that we're approaching it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1449.804s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1450.505s">Yeah,</a> so someone has a question about, because our last Solidarity Live was about MMT, modern monetary theory, and the fact that our national government does not have the restrictions on spending, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1467.975s">It's</a> not actually spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1468.915s">They're</a> creating, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1469.856s">They're</a> increasing the number when they spend, the national government spends. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1473.762s">You're</a> increasing the number of dollars that exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1477.243s">And</a> so there is no reason at all why the national government can't create a jobs program, do the Green New Deal, pay for Medicare for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1485.344s">All</a> of these things are, there is no how can we pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1488.565s">And</a> so the question is, how does that relate to the Massachusetts budget and the need to have those funds in that trust fund?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1539.798s">And</a> the federal government creates dollars, but the state governments don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1543.42s">So</a> the state governments are just like you or me or a company or your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1548.224s">They</a> can't just create dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1551.246s">They</a> have a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1552.947s">And</a> so their budgets are just as fixed as yours or mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1557.647s">So</a> the trust fund, I'd love to hear more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1563.129s">Let</a> me think about that for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1566.39s">And</a> how you would fix the problems that we have at the Massachusetts trust fund that it's not solvent.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1637.808s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1639.069s">And</a> how do we fix this trust fund problem here in Massachusetts?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1671.185s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1672.106s">And</a> by removing the cap on salaries that are taxed, do you have an idea, a sense of how that would affect the amount of money in the trust fund?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1774.998s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1775.459s">I</a> mean, it makes sense because we're in a huge crisis right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1778.681s">So</a> asking to suddenly make a fund that was insolvent for decades to make it solvent during a <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1786.847s">you</a> know, gigantic crisis where we're doing nothing but pour funds out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1790.77s">Obviously,</a> I think that's too much to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1794.553s">But</a> it sounds like removing the cap would bring in a lot more money.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1848.691s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1851.712s">Yeah,</a> and you said that it's at 15,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1854.113s">Yeah,</a> which is- That's insanely low. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1856.794s">It's</a> insanely low. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1859.775s">Only</a> like the very smallest companies are paying like, you know, the full, I mean, it really is- Full wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1869.679s">Yeah,</a> the full wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1871.377s">And</a> it really makes it clear that only companies, the more you pay your employees, the less and less and less and less and less you pay.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1911.496s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1913.777s">I'm</a> curious what sort of pushback you've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1917.298s">I</a> know that you've been sort of talking to some folks in the State House and trying to get some interest in some of these policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1925.001s">And</a> I don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1928.988s">out</a> anybody by name or anything, but I'm just curious a little bit about sort of what have people been like, oh, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1937.433s">Like,</a> I'm really excited about this part of it or that part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1940.014s">Have</a> people just been not interested? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1942.576s">Is</a> it too much change? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1943.496s">Is</a> it too wonky? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=1944.837s">I</a> mean, I hope nothing's too wonky for people at the state house because that's kind of their job.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2011.24s">OK,</a> so did they tell you why? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2013.797s">I</a> mean, we all know this is what happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2017.198s">But,</a> like, I'm a little surprised that they're, like, just saying it straight out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2021.299s">Like,</a> well, you know, if the giant corporations don't like it, then what?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2053.197s">Because</a> we have lobbying and because they're allowed to just pay people, you know, $100,000 a year to sit, you know, to show up at the, ah, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2062.483s">I'm</a> getting a little aggravated about my whole money in politics thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2066.306s">It</a> sounds like, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2068.767s">The</a> problem is that those are the people in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2071.029s">That</a> is the problem.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2109.149s">It's</a> a terrible way to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2111.33s">Actually,</a> it's people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2113.871s">You're</a> supposed to be representing people.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2208.879s">Speaking</a> of participate, I'm so glad you said that, because great segue. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2212.181s">What</a> can people do? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2215.048s">You</a> have so many great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2216.749s">You</a> have done so much incredible research into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2219.97s">I</a> really encourage anybody, if you're open to it, to call you and talk to you about this, because you have all the data to back it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2228.873s">And</a> I would love for you to just let us know, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2232.594s">How</a> can we help?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2323.851s">Awesome,</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2324.411s">Do</a> you wanna spell your name for folks so they can, and they can look you up on Instagram and Facebook? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2328.472s">M-O-L-L-Y.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2341.858s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2342.918s">Is</a> there anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2343.979s">I</a> mean, I think my sort of wrap up about this is, number one, unemployment is super broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2350.565s">I</a> had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2351.605s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2353.211s">And</a> I'm sure that the budgetary problems are affecting other parts of our state budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2358.674s">We're</a> spending, what did you say, like $60 million a year just on interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2364.657s">That's</a> $60 million a year that we cannot spend on other things.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2384.32s">Okay,</a> so it's actually, it is a separate thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2386.281s">It's</a> not going to affect the rest of the state budget, but it is going to be levied on business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2389.541s">So</a> this is going to hurt the economy and hurt small businesses a lot more than large businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2395.923s">No,</a> it's the worst time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2398.004s">Yeah,</a> but number one, the unemployment is deeply broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2401.864s">Number</a> two, that our legislature, they're just saying it straight out, like special interest rule, <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2413.061s">And</a> if you can't get them on board, tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2415.262s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2420.604s">It's</a> been eye opening, but I think it's, I love your idea that people just, just like, just open up your email or pick up the phone, call your state rep, tell them everything.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2465.852s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2468.474s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2469.395s">Any</a> last words? <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2470.415s">Anything</a> else you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2472.053s">get</a> out before we finish up?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2503.123s">Always</a> a pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2503.903s">Likewise.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2504.844s">Thanks</a> so much for coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2506.484s">I</a> love the work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2507.484s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2508.504s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2511.345s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wHD5nJf-x9I&t=2520.186s">Frank,</a> are we off the air?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=0.512s">Hi,</a> this is Anna Callahan with a post-campaign update. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=4.456s">By</a> the end of my campaign, I had started to think a lot about what I wanted to do if I were elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=11.317s">And</a> when I lost on election night, I realized that all of the things I was the most excited about, engaging new people in the political process, building the movement that we need in order to pass a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, a criminal justice overhaul, and housing for everyone here in Massachusetts, that all of those things were things that I didn't need to be a state rep to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=34.926s">I</a> can do them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=38.809s">There</a> has never been a more important moment in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=43.814s">between</a> the presidential elections and an ongoing pandemic leaving 40 million people unemployed, with a climate crisis and the racism in our society and our criminal justice system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=57.664s">We</a> need to step up our game to make the political process work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=63.208s">And</a> I agree with AOC when she talks about what we need to be doing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=68.351s">She</a> says we have to bring new people into the political process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=72.594s">And</a> I think her words were that we have to do that in every pocket of this country between now and the November elections to save our democracy and even after the elections as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=84.84s">And</a> I couldn't agree more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=86.862s">I</a> had the great privilege of being able to spend every day engaging people in state politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=94.425s">And</a> wow, I really miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=97.83s">loved</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=98.351s">I</a> loved walking outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=99.812s">I</a> loved meeting new people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=101.853s">I</a> loved hearing what matters to people, what issues people care about, and how it affects their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=107.878s">And</a> I really miss dreaming big about what we could have if we all worked together and if our government worked for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=117.445s">So</a> my team and I will be engaging people in the political process right now through conversations about the upcoming election on November 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=127.953s">We</a> are going to be knocking on doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=129.634s">We</a> are going to be hosting Zoom meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=131.935s">I'm</a> most excited about going on walk and talks in the different parts of the district so that we can meet people where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=138.938s">And</a> I hope that you'll join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=140.619s">I</a> really believe that if we build a movement here in this, one of the most progressive districts in one of the most progressive states in the country, that that is the way we can move our issues forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pGEp69VqToo&t=152.124s">So</a> I look forward to seeing you soon.<h2><a href="../2020-10-09_Hxpw4tp48vc/2020-10-09_Hxpw4tp48vc.html">Solidarity LIVE!

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=3.274s">You</a> let me know when we're live. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=6.717s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=7.558s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=9.039s">Good</a> to see everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=10.36s">Thanks</a> for tuning in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=12.041s">This</a> is Solidarity Live, where we talk about the issues that affect people in Medford and Somerville, and how we can work together to solve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=21.288s">Today,</a> we are going to be talking about an issue that affects everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=25.629s">everyone</a> in the United States, everyone in many other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=30.27s">And</a> that is the question of our national debt and our money supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=36.392s">So</a> before, I do have an exciting guest, but before I bring our guest on, I want to have people in the audience just think about a few questions before we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=46.075s">And</a> one is, do you think that our national debt is a problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=50.957s">Is</a> it something that worries you, the size of our national debt? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=55.076s">And</a> if we could reduce our national debt to zero, would that be good? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=57.978s">Is</a> that something that you think would help solve some of our problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=63.04s">And</a> my third question is, who are we borrowing this money from, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=69.344s">If</a> we have national debt, we've borrowed it from someone, we owe it to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=72.926s">Who</a> have we borrowed it from? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=74.107s">And</a> who do we owe it to? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=75.747s">And</a> how do we pay it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=78.192s">These</a> are questions we're going to be talking about in addition to the even more important questions about how a new way of understanding our national debt can help us be able to fund things like a Green New Deal and Medicare for All and other programs that are important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=98.336s">So</a> now I'm going to introduce <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=101.817s">Fadel</a> Kaboob and Frank, if Frank, our producer could bring Fadel on, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=108.447s">First,</a> let me just make sure if I pronounced your name correctly.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=115.606s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=116.246s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=117.648s">So</a> Fadl Kaboob is an associate professor of economics at Denison, and he's also the president of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=126.837s">And</a> Fadl, I would love for you to go ahead and just introduce yourself and your work.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=341.282s">And</a> it's so ingrained in us, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=343.824s">Because</a> we live with it day to day and we have this fear of what might happen if we go into debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=349.57s">We've</a> known people have gone into debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=352.092s">It's</a> a thing that's very difficult for us to think differently.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=780.706s">Can</a> I just pause you for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=782.387s">Yeah,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=783.968s">So</a> I want to go back a little bit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=786.43s">Because</a> I think when we use this term, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=789.051s">spending,</a> like the government is spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=790.973s">I</a> think it's very hard for us, you know, as people who spend money, who earn money, spend money, borrow money, when we talk about the federal government as spending money and borrowing money, I think it's hard for people to understand how it's different for the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=807.128s">So</a> when the federal government, let me just ask this question, when the federal government spends money, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=814.968s">and</a> you say spend into existence, like they're actually creating more dollars, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=821.151s">So</a> they're increasing the money supply, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=823.292s">So</a> it's not like they're spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=825.333s">They're</a> just creating more dollars and giving those new dollars to people or companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=832.476s">Is</a> that accurate?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=905.282s">There</a> doesn't have to be a war either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=906.925s">We</a> can just increase the military budget for no reason at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=911.154s">And</a> that money is created by the federal government because the federal government is the only entity in the world that can create dollars.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=956.461s">And</a> that means that it created more dollars in the economy than it destroyed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=963.104s">So</a> it simply increased the amount of money in the economy.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=996.296s">And</a> the same with the debt, that's also true of the debt, like that the total amount, I've heard Warren Moser talk about this, that like the total amount of the national debt is equivalent to the net amount of dollars in savings in the world.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1165.352s">So</a> is it fair to say that the debt, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1168.275s">I</a> mean, the deficit is what each year, like the yearly difference, right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1180.021s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1180.921s">And</a> so is it fair to say that the debt is the money supply? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1183.422s">I</a> mean, money supply has its own sort of definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1186.904s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1508.481s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1509.879s">So</a> another question, because I know part of what excites me and a lot of other people about this idea is the things that we could do, the things that we could afford, and how it affects those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1524.886s">And</a> I know a lot of people are interested in the question of inflation and how that, once we realize <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1540.248s">that</a> there really is no problem with the federal government creating money, right, spending money or creating money, that we can afford these things and we don't have to say for Medicare for all, we don't have to say how can we pay for that, we never have to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1557.112s">So</a> now the real question becomes inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1560.233s">And</a> so I'd love for you to talk about maybe the jobs guarantee and or Medicare for all and or other programs that we could be spending more on, maybe, you know, college debt and how that kind of intersects with inflation.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1746.476s">Or</a> we don't know what we're doing in the central bank.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1969.368s">And</a> by the way, I'm gonna let you go on in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1972.569s">We</a> do have a question from the audience, so.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=1976.234s">If</a> you want to keep going, then we'll come back.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2328.805s">And</a> this seems like it's related to the inflation deflation problem, that if all the money being spent goes to the 1% who are not going to buy more consumer goods, then it doesn't help <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2342.755s">bring</a> inflation up, which is apparently I didn't know this is what people are trying to do now because their inflation is not for normal consumer goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2351.497s">There</a> isn't enough demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2352.957s">Does</a> that sound right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2734.295s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2735.322s">So,</a> wow, I think we could talk for hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2738.263s">It</a> would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2741.803s">It's</a> such a deep, deep subject, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2746.184s">And</a> I think hard for, you know, when I first learned about it, just wrapping my head around it, it took me hours and hours of listening to all sorts of different MMT people give lectures and reading and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2760.729s">I</a> hope we can do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2763.31s">Let</a> us know how we can help get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2766.972s">We're</a> going to certainly do our best to get the word out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2769.593s">I</a> just want to ask you if you have any final words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2775.396s">We</a> don't have a specific time limit, but we try to keep it under around 45-50 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hxpw4tp48vc&t=2779.277s">What</a> are your thoughts maybe on what are our next steps?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=0.291s">Some</a> people say that I'm a little too honest to be a politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=3.293s">But</a> I've never understood why you wouldn't want to be clear about what you think and what you feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=8.415s">And</a> it's one of the things that I love the most about the culture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=11.657s">People</a> are really open about what they think and what they stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=17.259s">My</a> name's Anna Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=19.04s">I</a> live in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=20.02s">I've</a> been here since 2003. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=20.841s">I</a> live with my husband and my son and several absolutely wonderful housemates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=27.544s">Because</a> really, who could afford the rent here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=30.314s">I</a> was a software engineer until four years ago, when I realized that I just could not sit by any longer, and I became devoted to political activism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=40.417s">I</a> started an organization called The Incorruptibles, and through that I have spent the last few years training people in cities across the country to really build progressive electoral power from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=54.261s">The</a> Massachusetts Statehouse is not a very progressive body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=57.513s">And</a> the more you learn about it, the more it is obvious that it is a dysfunctional and deeply broken institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=65.88s">It</a> is very difficult to find out what is happening at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=69.843s">And</a> it's designed to keep voters in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=72.225s">I</a> want to mobilize the people of Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=74.947s">I</a> want to lift the veil off of the statehouse so that my neighbors can hold me and my fellow state reps accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=80.772s">Our</a> state rep has voted again and again to make sure that that doesn't happen, and it is wasting our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=86.596s">We</a> are in a moment in history when big changes are going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=91.52s">We</a> need a statehouse that is ready to make bold, progressive change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=95.783s">This</a> election is about good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=97.685s">This</a> election is about whether our state rep's votes are secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=100.827s">This</a> election is about whether we as constituents have enough time to organize around legislation before it's already been voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=108.269s">And</a> fundamentally, this election is about the concentration of power in the hands of the speaker that prevents us from passing the no-brainer progressive policies that the people of Massachusetts want, need, and deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=122.332s">We</a> all have progressive values here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=124.853s">We</a> need progressive action.<h2><a href="../2020-07-23_n_9e096pvxo/2020-07-23_n_9e096pvxo.html">Solidarity Live: Discussing Criminal Justice with Caroline Bays</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=0.331s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=0.892s">So</a> first, we're going to talk about how COVID-19 is affecting folks in jails. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=7.738s">And</a> I would love it if you would go ahead and just introduce yourself and how you are sort of related to this topic.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=62.411s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=64.472s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=65.412s">Before</a> we talk a little bit more generally about what's happening, well, you tell me, do you want to talk generally about what's happening in Massachusetts prisons? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=74.854s">Or</a> do you want to go, should we just go straight at what's happening related to COVID-19? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=78.775s">I</a> think let's start with COVID-19 and why it's so dangerous for them at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=83.356s">And</a> then we can broaden it up a little bit after this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=175.614s">Do</a> you mean that the prisoners themselves are spending their own money to buy soap?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=192.52s">So</a> before you go on, I do want to just mention, um, we have someone who's commented on YouTube saying, um, they're hoping to hear about what correctional facilities are doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=204.928s">Um,</a> and so it sounds like one thing that they're doing is they have, they seem to have obtained masks, which, you know, it's so incredibly important for our, like there's a shortage of masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=214.413s">And</a> it's so important for our hospital staff and doctors to be able to have the masks that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=220.881s">And</a> of course, it's important for correctional facilities to have masks as well, but not if they're just wearing them around their neck and using it to, you know, taunt <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=234.147s">The</a> inmates.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=308.157s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=308.677s">So</a> I'm going to jump in. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=310.318s">I</a> can't resist jumping in here because I did spend two nights in jail in 2000 when I was illegally arrested for protesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=320.583s">There</a> were about 71 of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=322.924s">We</a> were illegally strip searched. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=325.706s">The</a> women only were strip searched twice during our time there, and there was a giant lawsuit afterwards and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=331.208s">But</a> I will say that this was in Los Angeles, and I will say that we were <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=336.891s">We</a> were arrested and literally not allowed to wash in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=342.273s">And</a> the police who had arrested us had us leaning up against, like, pushing us against a chain link fence that was, like, covered in grease and oil because it was right directly underneath a freeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=354.537s">And</a> so our hands and our bodies were just, they had all this black grease all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=360.719s">And</a> we were not, there was no, <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=363.801s">ability</a> for us to wash anything at all for like, you know, 30 hours or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=369.858s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=372.975s">And</a> the whole taunting thing, people may not realize how much psychological games are played to inmates by correctional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=387.803s">So</a> the idea that correctional staff are joking about purposefully getting inmates sick with COVID-19, that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=401.372s">you</a> know when this is real psychological <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=405.488s">I</a> mean, it's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=406.629s">That</a> should not be legal for them to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=409.491s">And</a> then I want to, for a second, before we go on, to talk a little bit about how dangerous it is to be in these close quarters with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=420.117s">I</a> mean, we're talking about social distancing, and people who are incarcerated do not have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=428.743s">So</a> can you talk a little bit just about how dangerous it is and if there have been any outbreaks inside of any correctional facilities?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=522.344s">We</a> have another question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=525.748s">Are</a> there ways for people to get involved and support the incarcerated population during this time of crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=531.855s">Canteen</a> money for soap, masks, letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=534.097s">I</a> am sympathetic to those who are in prisons.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=594.484s">And</a> before we go on to the next questions, we do have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=598.527s">You're</a> saying that letters and emails are really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=601.688s">Is</a> there a particular easy way? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=604.53s">I</a> know that a lot of people who are involved in Mamas Mutually Medford and Somerville are, people want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=611.874s">People</a> want to be able to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=613.715s">What's</a> an easy way for people to get involved that way?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=679.87s">And</a> I assume we can't do that right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=683.332s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=684.093s">Yeah,</a> there's no visiting, right.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=739.031s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=740.172s">There</a> is another question, which is, do you know what sort of medical care is available in case someone in prison does get the virus?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=793.017s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=794.599s">So,</a> you know, I've heard, I know that a couple of our city councilors here in Somerville, Ben, you and Kevin and JT Scott, and as well as other people have been talking about releasing certain portions of the prison population. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=809.415s">Certainly</a> the the ones who are oh, what's I'm forgetting the term I I sometimes call it debtors prison, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=815.917s">It's</a> people who their pretrial detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=818.458s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=818.838s">So</a> they they haven't been convicted of anything and they just can't pay bail. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=823.079s">And</a> so they're held in jail.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=851.819s">It</a> is so insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=853.961s">It's</a> really mind-blowing to me that this is true in America today.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=909.678s">Is</a> there some way that we can pressure people? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=913.159s">Is</a> there a way that folks listening here can help with that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=956.478s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=957.96s">Do</a> you want to talk a little bit about, we've talked a lot about COVID-19 and how it's affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=964.265s">Can</a> you talk to us a little bit about what you were working on before COVID-19 and about solitary confinement?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1020.387s">How</a> is that legal?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1061.563s">And</a> by the way, I think you once mentioned to me the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1065.664s">Isn't</a> there a limit under the sort of world human rights? <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1072.546s">Who</a> has a limit that's... Oh, 15 days.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1114.818s">That</a> is totally insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1117.06s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1117.38s">That's</a> horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/n_9e096pvxo&t=1118.2s">Horrifying.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=248.269s">That</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=249.409s">Really</a> needed work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=252.116s">Do</a> you have an idea of how many folks you interact with as a homeless population in need, like on a daily or weekly basis?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=359.362s">Yeah,</a> that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=362.884s">Can</a> you talk about how COVID-19 is affecting the people that you're helping?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=564.362s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=566.875s">Do</a> you have any final thoughts, anything else that you want people to know about what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=573.339s">Oh,</a> you know, I heard on WBUR there was a segment on homeless shelters, and all I remember is hearing that they had gotten enough tests to test an entire homeless shelter, like every single person in the shelter, and that some crazy high percentage of them <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=596.4s">One</a> in three. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=597.481s">Yeah,</a> that's what I remember, but I didn't want to quote it because it seems so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=601.784s">But</a> a lot of them were asymptomatic and they didn't show signs of the disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=606.969s">What</a> do you think that that means?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=675.26s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=676.02s">And</a> so it sounds like the program that you have where you actually house people is the safest for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=682.942s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=683.903s">In</a> addition to being obviously the best for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=687.764s">When</a> you can house people and they can have their own home, it's clearly better for many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/qEyVvR4dS1w&t=691.765s">But</a> here in COVID-19, it's even more crucial.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=273.12s">I</a> think it seems like you've frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=282.711s">So</a> give me one second, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=284.893s">It</a> looks like we had a little problem with Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=291.36s">Hang</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=322.544s">We</a> are just trying to get Kenya Alfaro back on from the Welcome Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=335.131s">I'm</a> going to go ahead and do what I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=349.319s">to</a> get Kenya back on, to get our folks from Tufts Mutual Aid back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=356.522s">They</a> are also, ah, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=359.663s">So</a> it looks like, ah, we have everyone back, amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=363.684s">So</a> sorry about that, I do not know exactly what happened, but I lost all of you and my whole Skype went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=371.667s">So</a> I apologize, thanks everyone for sticking with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=374.648s">So</a> Kenya. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=377.091s">You</a> were talking about food resources and how the city of Somerville has really done some work there to make food resources available to people.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=416.808s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=418.389s">And</a> do you know if folks in that community have been plugging into the Mutual Aid, so the Medford and Somerville Mutual Aid, or in any of the other cities' Mutual Aid projects?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=480.811s">Great,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=482.432s">And</a> you have a particular fund that you administer, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=486.172s">Do</a> you wanna talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=618.077s">I'll</a> just remind people that if you have any questions, you can just put those in the comment box and we can pull those right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=624.66s">In</a> your outreach, you guys must have a lot of languages on hand, I imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=632.064s">When</a> you're calling through people, how many different languages do you have to rely on to reach out to people?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=712.75s">Great,</a> that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=714.132s">And</a> are there ways that people can help? <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=716.054s">I</a> mean, it sounds like people can donate to that fund specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=718.717s">And</a> the fund, I assume, is directly related to COVID, and it started with COVID, and so it really has to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=725.786s">Are</a> there other ways in addition to that that people can help?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=806.839s">Yeah,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=807.939s">It</a> sounds like at one point there was a need for masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=810.622s">I</a> know <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=811.623s">you</a> know, a lot of folks and mamas are excited to make masks, so I don't know if that's something that people still need.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=826.037s">Let's</a> be clear, there's a new law in Somerville saying that when out of your house, you must wear a mask, and there is a fine, up to $300, I think, fine related to that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=902.94s">Great,</a> do you wanna give just a little plug for like how people can find you, how people can donate to the fund or help out in other ways? <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=910.746s">Like</a> specifically, like what's the website and?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=955.641s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=956.101s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=956.962s">Great</a> work that you guys are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=959.584s">Wonderful</a> to have you on and keep us updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/coULKT1cTns&t=962.627s">Let</a> us know as things change, if there are more needs and other ways that people can help.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=0.508s">We</a> now have someone who is from here, but is currently in South Korea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=7.031s">And</a> I don't know how many people listening know about South Korea and the way that they have dealt with COVID, but it's very different from how the US has dealt with COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=19.937s">And</a> so here is Howard Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=23.078s">I'm</a> just gonna pop your name up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=28.092s">And</a> you are live, so Howard, it's great to see you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=34.197s">Thanks</a> for coming on.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=155.169s">When</a> you say you're hearing this news, you mean in America?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=215.332s">So,</a> yeah, what I've heard is that it was, at first, you could only get tested, even if you had symptoms, you could only get tested if you had a known contact, if you'd been in contact with someone who was known to have had COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=227.539s">That</a> was how limited the testing was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=229.46s">And</a> now, then it was if you had symptoms of COVID, they're loosening it up a little bit, but it is still very difficult to get a test.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=275.666s">I</a> was just going to ask if the test results had come back yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=277.647s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=277.928s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=280.309s">Get</a> the test back.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=351.826s">So</a> even though you were tested and your test came back after one day, did they ask you to stay indoors for two weeks or did they just give you two weeks worth of food and then tell you you could go out?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=418.538s">So</a> you had two weeks of staying at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=422.04s">You</a> got tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=423.201s">Your</a> test came back negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=425.302s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=425.462s">And</a> then you were at home for two weeks, maybe because there's some chance that you could have had and it hadn't shown up yet on the test for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=434.44s">you</a> stayed home for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=436.382s">And</a> after that time, now tell us what is your life like?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=469.905s">Now,</a> when you were staying at your parents' house, did they have to stay home?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=480.647s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=523.383s">But</a> restaurants, coffee shops?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=667.832s">Can</a> I ask you, where does South Korea get all these tests? <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=674.537s">We</a> cannot seem to get tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=676.559s">You</a> may not even know this, <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=678.821s">Why</a> is there such a difference in the ability for people in South Korea to access tests than people like in Somerville, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=687.208s">Why</a> can we not access tests here?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=782.575s">I</a> heard about this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=886.578s">Can</a> I ask, does South Korea have a national healthcare system?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1007.691s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1008.791s">It</a> is such an amazing story. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1011.132s">And</a> I'm so glad that you started with the personal story of your own experience living in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1018.875s">And</a> I had not realized that you were here when COVID started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1023.817s">And</a> you decided to go to South Korea knowing that the South Korean reaction to this was going to be much better, was much better, and that you would be both safer <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1035.745s">and</a> more free to go about your normal daily life in South Korea than here?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1099.341s">And</a> now in Somerville, you would be forced to work remotely anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1102.523s">Like</a> you would still be having to work remotely right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1132.923s">But</a> South Korea's response sounds like it's just a lot more sustainable than ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1139.746s">Because</a> you guys are going about mostly about your normal business, but with the testing and tracing program that they have, the contact tracing program, they can contain it very well while most people are kind of going about their daily lives and the economy is not under a huge hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1158.212s">Does</a> that sound about right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1188.949s">Is</a> that crazy? <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1190.21s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1190.57s">We'll</a> have to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1191.45s">I</a> really have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1192.69s">We'll</a> check on that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1194.531s">It</a> might be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1195.191s">I</a> mean, hey, we're in the US, where medical things cost ridiculous amounts of money.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1211.717s">South</a> Korean ones or United States?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1225.024s">We'll</a> get to our experts and we'll ask about that here as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1241.055s">So</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1242.015s">So</a> we have something to look forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1245.077s">We</a> can get life back to normal and keep this thing under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1249.819s">So</a> it has been really eye-opening to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1253.5s">I</a> appreciate you coming on so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1255.501s">And</a> I have to say, it is kind of amazing that your Skype feed is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1261.671s">half</a> a world away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1263.371s">So</a> good job Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1265.112s">Yeah,</a> no kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1268.292s">So</a> yeah, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOkJhjHQMM&t=1269.212s">Do</a> you have any last, any final words before we let you go?

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=0.031s">What</a> is the biggest point that differentiates you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=4.899s">Callahan,</a> from your opponent? <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=9.804s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=10.145s">I</a> think I probably already said it, but I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=12.526s">I</a> think right now, the Massachusetts Democratic Party platform is very progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=19.672s">It</a> is essentially the Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=24.555s">It</a> is very popular in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=27.818s">We</a> have a veto proof super majority of Democrats in the House and Senate and we cannot pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=36.024s">Medicare</a> for all we cannot pass real climate change legislation, we can't we can't pass any of the things that are in that document, and it's because there is a concentration of power in the hands of the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=51.945s">And</a> that is the big difference between. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=54.918s">the</a> two of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=57.179s">Representative</a> Barber voted to end term limits for the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=60.84s">I</a> would vote to have term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=62.581s">She</a> voted to increase the pay for the speaker and the pay for all of the committee chairs and co-chairs that the speaker alone chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=69.963s">I</a> think that the speaker should not be choosing those. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=72.604s">I</a> think they should be chosen by a secret vote for the entire house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=78.826s">She</a> voted against transparency, like making committee votes public. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=84.068s">making</a> committee votes that are public putting them on the website, all of that stuff we need transparency everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=90.173s">In</a> fact, we actually need for our legislature to no longer be exempt from public records law, we are one of only two states in the country where all three branches of government are exempt from public records law, and that is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=104.144s">The</a> lack of transparency, the lack of time for legislators to look at bills, means that we can't organize as activists around those bills either. <a href="https://youtu.be/hofMnXRSWLE&t=113.571s">And</a> this whole situation, the culture, the rules, the financial incentives, prevents us from passing progressive policies, prevents us from passing the Massachusetts Democratic Party platform, and I will work very hard to end that.<h2><a href="../2020-07-09_JLW5PPl1bsQ/2020-07-09_JLW5PPl1bsQ.html">Climate Change - Anna Callahan for MA State Rep</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=0.532s">One</a> thing to realize is that every time we turn around, scientists are saying, oh actually we were wrong, climate change is way worse than we thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=7.86s">So,</a> we need to look at everything through a lens of environmental justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=14.527s">The</a> Green Justice Coalition has the right idea which is to put together <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=19.613s">Marginalized</a> communities of color that are most impacted by climate change with labor and environmental groups, and that is how we develop a Green New Deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=29.621s">We</a> have to commit to sourcing our electricity from 100% renewables by 2035 at the latest. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=37.348s">We</a> have to divest from fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=39.609s">We</a> have to convert government transportation to electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=43.81s">We</a> have to make sure that all new housing is passive housing, is zero emissions housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=50.391s">But</a> more than that, we are eventually going to have to have a plan for how are we going to switch our private transportation to electric? <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=59.433s">How</a> are we going to retrofit all of our housing and commercial buildings so that they are not <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=67.035s">also</a> emitting carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=70.756s">And</a> so it's a very complex problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=73.377s">And</a> again, the way we go about it is through a coalition of groups that really centralizes the voices of the people most impacted by climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=86.36s">And</a> I really want to say that the people of Massachusetts are totally ready for this in every poll, willing to pay extra money for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=93.624s">The</a> legislature is not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=95.765s">We</a> have to get rid of the concentration of power and the stranglehold that the speaker has over the state house, because that's how we can get this done.<h2><a href="../2020-06-20_Es1km9jUMPM/2020-06-20_Es1km9jUMPM.html">Anna Callahan for State Rep -- why I'm running for office</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=20.435s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=21.716s">I</a> am running for state representative in the 34th Middlesex District, which is part Somerville and part Medford.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=58.752s">Yeah,</a> there is something that someone I highly respect said to me a few years ago that really drives everything that I have done for the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=70.379s">She</a> says, if they have the money and we have the people, we cannot win by preaching to the choir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=79.795s">So</a> that to me drives home this point that we're not gonna pass a Green New Deal without a movement behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=87.159s">Not</a> here in Massachusetts, not nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=89.98s">We're</a> not gonna pass Medicare for all without a movement behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=93.162s">We're</a> not gonna get any of the things that we want, need, and deserve, including literally saving our planet and our species from extinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=104.868s">We</a> are not gonna get those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=107.47s">unless</a> we really bring more people, like a lot more people, into the political process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=116.815s">So</a> I've been spending my last four years training people in kind of a different model of political organizing that elects slates of progressives to city councils while building a movement on the ground to support those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=135.351s">And</a> I just concluded that it's about time for me to step in and do the candidates part of that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=154.477s">Yeah,</a> so the model is really quite different from what most people around the country are currently doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=161.821s">And</a> we got this, so I started this organization four years ago, three and a half years ago, called The Incorruptibles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=169.465s">And</a> that's what we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=170.866s">We've</a> been training people around the country in this model. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=174.248s">So</a> the difference between the two models is, here's the old model, probably sound kind of familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=182.292s">You</a> get a bunch of people together, <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=184.773s">You</a> wait until candidates announce that they're running. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=191.057s">You</a> choose the least bad one of the candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=195.22s">And</a> then you do everything that you can to get that person elected, which is where most of the training in this country happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=201.064s">The</a> training is around getting people elected, whether they are great, good, or mediocre. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=207.228s">And</a> then the last step is after that person is elected and they start doing something you don't like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=213.371s">get</a> angry, and start over at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=217.195s">It's</a> not actually a very effective model. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=221.72s">It</a> doesn't lead to sort of lasting change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=224.423s">We're</a> always back at the beginning again trying to elect one more progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=230.728s">The</a> new model involves putting together a coalition that comes up with a single platform and then runs slates of candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=243.351s">And</a> those candidates hopefully are not people who self-select. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=247.512s">When</a> people self-select, they are more likely to be wealthier, more likely to be white, more likely to be male. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=258.568s">But</a> when through your coalition, you are, and the coalition is all of, you know, a lot of working class people, marginalized, vulnerable communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=272.132s">And</a> when you work through that coalition to bring people, to sort of train people up to be candidates, to encourage people to be candidates who might never have thought of being a candidate, then you get a much better diversity of candidates who's more likely to maintain those ties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=294.086s">And</a> then once you run these slates of candidates on a single platform, once they get elected, and this part is really, really different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=303.311s">Everybody</a> talks about holding representatives accountable, and that is an antagonistic relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=310.014s">But</a> the way that this model works, there is an intimate working relationship between the coalition <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=318.397s">and</a> the elected official, where that coalition is really co-governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=322.419s">So</a> they are helping to figure out what is on the agenda, what maybe is missing on the city council meetings, or the state agenda for that cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=334.084s">to</a> strategize together about how we're going to pass policy, to be involved sometimes in writing the policy, and really to work together and get the grassroots out to pass that policy.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=357.571s">I</a> did not create it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=358.651s">So</a> I had the great fortune of working with Gail McLaughlin, who was the mayor of Richmond, California. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=368.594s">And</a> in Richmond, the town of Richmond really had been owned by Chevron for 100 years, to the point that Chevron actually had a desk inside City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=381.197s">And</a> they would pay off every single politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=383.437s">And</a> by pay off, they're donating to their campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=387.258s">So</a> in the early 2000s, some people formed the Rich and Progressive Alliance and they did this whole model and over the course of seven or eight years, they had a majority on the city council plus the mayor and they passed <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=403.524s">most</a> incredible suite of policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=406.325s">They</a> passed the first rent control bill in the state of California in 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=410.027s">They</a> reduced the homicide rate from the second highest homicide rate in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=414.108s">They</a> reduced it by 75%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=415.489s">They</a> got $100 million in new taxes from Chevron. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=419.71s">I</a> mean, I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=420.951s">There's</a> like some amazing, amazing things that they <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=424.652s">continue</a> to do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=425.552s">They're</a> still in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=426.672s">So</a> that does not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=428.293s">They</a> are still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=430.173s">They</a> have a strong coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=432.634s">And</a> so I got to work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=433.874s">I</a> also worked with Jane McAlevey, who is such a powerhouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=440.276s">She's</a> one of the most successful union organizers in the last 40 or 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=446.797s">She</a> gets 95% participation in the unions where she organizes, and it's not because everybody there is pro-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=454.76s">It</a> is because she does the really hard work of convincing people to join the struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=463.58s">And</a> she has done it thousands of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=466.381s">She</a> has perfected this, you know, the sort of convincing conversation, this long relationship where in the end, those people join the struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=474.843s">And</a> so I got to incorporate her ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=476.504s">She's</a> the one who said, if they have the money and we have the people, we'll never win by preaching to the choir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=481.525s">So</a> she has really proven that herself hundreds of times and gotten, you know, her, the unions she works with, <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=491.528s">get</a> amazing wins.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=506.147s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=506.648s">So</a> people who have listened to this podcast will have heard this many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=512.874s">In</a> Massachusetts, there is a combination of a set of rules, financial incentives, and a culture that basically puts all power in the hands of the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=527.673s">You</a> know, AOC talks about the vice grip of pressure that she is under, psychological pressure, social pressure, political pressure, every moment of every day to conform, and that kind of pressure exists at the State House as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=544.237s">Specifically,</a> one of the things that we're trying to change first is transparency, that there is really no way for you or anyone to know how their state rep is voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=557.483s">It's</a> all done secretly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=560.344s">And</a> so most bills, the decision as to whether a bill will move forward or not is done by a very small group of people in a backroom deal, and it is completely undemocratic.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=609.259s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=609.779s">I'm</a> going to give a little bit of a long answer here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=613.579s">I'm</a> going to, I'm going to start with, <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=617.974s">with</a> national politics, only to make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=621.396s">So</a> there was a study done by some Princeton researchers on, they took about 20 years of bills that went through Congress, every single bill, 20 years of Congress, every single bill that entered, that passed, that failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=640.049s">And</a> they basically looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=644.148s">whether</a> how people felt about those bills, how, you know, the top 10% of wage earners felt about those bills, and how the bottom 90% of wage earners felt about those bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=656.236s">And</a> the conclusion of that research study was that it was about 2000 bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=663.841s">So</a> the conclusion of that research study was that <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=667.474s">The</a> top 10% of wage earners pretty much control which bills pass and which bills fail, especially which bills fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=675.436s">Anything</a> that they don't like, they can absolutely make fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=680.097s">The</a> bottom 90% of wage earners, I believe their quote was, the desires of the average American have a minuscule, near zero, statistically insignificant impact on public policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=698.912s">So</a> that is really something to like take some serious pause at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=705.234s">That</a> our Congress serves the wealth, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=710.036s">Full</a> stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=713.497s">And</a> what people say a lot is they talk about money in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=716.738s">It's</a> all money in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=719.259s">And</a> I don't believe that it's all money in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=721.459s">I,</a> like you, I believe that most people enter public office with good intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=729.007s">So</a> now I want to talk a little bit about what life is like for progressive elected officials right after they get elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=738.395s">And</a> this is from my experience providing these training sessions to people around the country, in Oklahoma, in, you know, northern, central, and southern California, in Pennsylvania, in Kansas, in Rhode Island, in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=753.589s">and</a> sometimes having mayors or city councilors attend the workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=761.64s">And</a> these are all, the progressive ones are the ones attending the workshops, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=764.162s">Because</a> we give these workshops through an Our Revolution group, through a DSA chapter, through an indivisible group, through a PDA, Progressive Democrats of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=774.471s">So</a> it's always, we find a group that is interested in the coalition building side of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=781.697s">And</a> then elected officials that are friendly with them sometimes attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=786.983s">So</a> here's what happens when a progressive gets elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=790.844s">They</a> have a whole team of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=793.005s">This</a> is to city council or state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=795.426s">They</a> have a whole team of people working to get them elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=800.487s">And</a> they have this great party on election night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=803.468s">And</a> everybody is really happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=805.809s">And</a> all those volunteers go home and pretty much totally stop interacting with that elected official for six months, eight months, a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=816.77s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=817.31s">They</a> just, they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=822.073s">Meanwhile,</a> the elected official goes to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=826.296s">And</a> while they are at work, they're contacted and asked to have meetings with developers, lobbyists, chamber of commerce, CEOs, the <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=844.332s">As</a> things pass through the city council or through the state house, there are all sorts of consultants that develop, you know, beautiful reports that have all these graphs that are well-researched, that have lots of photos. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=860.095s">And</a> most of those, who's paying for those? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=863.196s">Corporations</a> are paying for those, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=865.837s">Somebody</a> has to pay for those reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=867.937s">That's</a> where these sitting elected officials get their information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=872.353s">because</a> no one else is providing information for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=876.234s">And</a> even their own constituents, I talked to a state rep, actually one of the earlier podcasts, one of the state reps said that if she didn't go out of her way, out of a district of 40,000 people, she would probably hear from the same 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=899.353s">The</a> people who feel like it's their prerogative to contact a state representative are people in general in the top 20% of wage earners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=909.995s">So</a> even your own constituents, that's part of the job, is you have to serve your constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=915.496s">But</a> if you don't try to have some control over who you listen to, you will literally only hear from <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=927.386s">pro</a> corporate, pro wealthy, top 20% people, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=936.713s">That's</a> the nature of the job.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=965.754s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=967.717s">So</a> part of the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=970.28s">is</a> a very specific, deliberate strategy to ensure that the elected official is hearing not only from the sort of grass tops, like the leadership of organizations that either serve or whose members are part of working class communities, but that you're directly listening to vulnerable, marginalized working class people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=999.302s">And</a> here's how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1000.903s">It's</a> not super difficult, but it's time consuming and it's hard work and you have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1006.967s">You</a> start off, and I recommend doing this with others, not by yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1012.23s">So</a> hopefully with an organization that wants to be involved because it's a lot of work and they can help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1018.274s">Step</a> one is really to list who are the underrepresented, marginalized, vulnerable people who live in your city or district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1029.882s">And</a> that's probably gonna include like 30 or 40 demographics, sometimes overlapping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1038.008s">With</a> that list, you then start to make another list, which is who are the individuals or organizations that have access to those people? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1048.195s">Who</a> are the ones that are trusted by those people? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1050.477s">Who</a> are the ones that serve those people in some capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1056.521s">And</a> then you start having one-on-ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1059.578s">and</a> you meet with those folks with the goal of setting up listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1066.325s">So</a> let's say, for example, that you want to meet with, you know, that there is like a Haitian community in your area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1079.017s">And</a> you have done a few one-on-ones, and through talking to those people, you've identified that there is a particular church leader that knows a lot of folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1090.188s">And</a> you meet with them, and they're very excited about the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1094.112s">So</a> then they help you set up a meeting that they bring their people to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1102.072s">with</a> translators if necessary, you know, whatever you need to make happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1105.633s">And</a> ideally, it's at their location, so they feel comfortable, and it's at their timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1112.296s">So</a> if it is at a church, it might be like immediately after the service at the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1119.078s">And</a> it's this the whole meeting is 70% listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1122.019s">So</a> the idea is you ask people how state politics affects their lives, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1128.161s">How</a> many people in this room have <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1131.208s">not</a> gone to the doctor because of cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1134.798s">And</a> then you get their stories, their personal stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1140.393s">After,</a> so you do that throughout for every, you keep doing this and you, and this never stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1146.578s">You</a> can be in office for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1147.839s">Frankly,</a> this is exactly what Bernie does and has always done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1151.742s">I</a> remember reading, I kind of knew this, but I, I remember reading in one of his books and on page 202, one of his books, he says, oh, I, it's May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1161.129s">And</a> I just had my sixth town hall with high school students only of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1168.465s">So</a> he had already done 600 town halls that year, more than one per month, that only included high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1175.107s">And</a> you know, he's also done half a dozen for every other, you know, underrepresented community in his area, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1186.009s">In</a> his state, in his city, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1187.57s">So,</a> so this is the way that you maintain those connections and you hear the stories of how policy is actually affecting people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1198.857s">And</a> the last thing I'll say is that it doesn't quite stop there because those personal stories, like when you're at the meeting, you are engaging, you try to engage those people in the political process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1211.78s">You</a> help them to understand, you can narrow in on some particular policy that they want to change, and then you help them and get them to be activated in something that they can affect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1226.156s">But</a> after that, the personal stories are incredibly effective for motivating other people to action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1232.982s">So</a> those personal stories, you can use them with permission to help everyone else that you have then been involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1243.492s">Everybody</a> from like all the more politically active activist organizations to all of these, you know, more underserved groups that you're meeting with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1253.288s">when</a> they hear that personal story they will be motivated to act on an issue that maybe isn't their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1261.096s">So</a> that's the model.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1286.445s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1288.367s">Movement</a> building is the reason that I'm running. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1292.797s">I</a> think we can do a lot, not just within the district to, you know, I just described it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1300.304s">So,</a> you know, doing all of that work in the district will be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1304.828s">But</a> I think with those connections with people in the district, you also connect with people in other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1314.037s">I'm</a> also running, I mean, you know, you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1318.497s">It</a> would be great if more politicians were doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1320.638s">And</a> that is the entire purpose of the incorruptibles and what I've spent my life doing for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1326.322s">So</a> I really intend to help bring this model to other elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1334.146s">It</a> really is to their best interest, because if you do this model really well, you will, they can run anybody they want against you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1340.83s">They</a> can pour millions of dollars against you and you will win your reelection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1346.675s">So</a> those sorts of, like the long-term goal of being able to, as an elected official, I think I'll be able to get the word out more and get more interest in the model as an elected official than I have been just as a regular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1365.003s">And</a> then, you know, transparency matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1369.485s">The</a> culture at the Statehouse, the rules at the Statehouse, the financial incentives at the Statehouse mean that Massachusetts cannot move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1380.471s">We</a> cannot be a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1382.452s">Our</a> people, the Bay Staters, are ready to lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1387.53s">We</a> are ready to lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1388.571s">We</a> want to lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1390.493s">On</a> environmental stuff, everybody is ready to even spend a little bit more money so that Massachusetts can lead in, you know, really pushing back against climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1406.67s">But</a> we can't do it because of the <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1409.252s">the</a> culture happening, the rules, the financial incentives, essentially the stranglehold that the speaker has over policy that passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Es1km9jUMPM&t=1416.897s">So</a> I will do everything that I can to get democracy at our statehouse.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=105.677s">So</a> can you talk about the Islamic Cultural Center and its mission and, you know, sort of what you do there?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=143.65s">Oh,</a> hey, JT. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=146.753s">You</a> know, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=148.074s">I</a> think I answered the call from you, and I accidentally lost Nicole and Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=156.902s">Let</a> me see if I can grab them. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=158.183s">I</a> was right in the middle of talking to Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=160.454s">Good</a> to see you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=166.196s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=167.116s">Thank</a> you so, so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=169.277s">I</a> am going to grab the two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=171.377s">So</a> hang on everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=173.878s">JT</a> is coming right up. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=177.119s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=189.123s">I'm</a> dialing them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=190.143s">We're</a> going to have them on the line in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=199.726s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=200.786s">Nicole,</a> I am so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=202.926s">We</a> had a Skype kerfuffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=205.867s">So</a> let me go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=208.428s">I</a> don't yet have your video. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=220.043s">I've</a> got JT on here with Nicole's name under it. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=223.326s">Oh,</a> there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=224.146s">Okay,</a> I'm going to switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=225.347s">I'm</a> going to switch out JT. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=227.349s">I'm</a> going to switch in Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=236.195s">All</a> right, we're doing this thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=239.608s">Ah,</a> brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=241.27s">I</a> think we've got everybody on the call now, so that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=244.612s">So,</a> Nicole, so sorry about the interruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=248.074s">If</a> you can talk a little bit about, yeah, you were talking about the mission of the Islamic Cultural Center, providing, you know, sort of spiritual space for them, and if you don't mind picking up from there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=343.138s">Yeah,</a> I mean, we're sort of all in the same boat on that front. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=347.362s">Everybody's</a> programming, doing everything had to be cancelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=350.285s">And</a> it's so great that there is this physical space for the Muslim community in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=360.816s">And</a> I imagine that you, given your role, that you hear from a lot of the Muslim families and the Muslim people in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=368.419s">And</a> I'd love to kind of ask you, how is that community faring during COVID-19?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=388.699s">Which</a> both you and I know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=390.299s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=474.318s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=475.928s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=476.628s">Yeah,</a> I'm sure that is tough to have that going on at the same time.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=519.273s">And</a> I imagine that for people who live alone, it's maybe even more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=524.979s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=528.324s">So,</a> you know, mostly this is about sort of reaching out and hearing from the Muslim community and how you're doing, but I can't resist asking you about your own race. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=539.694s">And</a> I would just love, you know, without spending too much time on it, I would love to kind of hear, you know, why you're running and, you know, just to say, feel free to talk a little bit about your race.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=732.078s">And</a> that just happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=734.221s">For</a> all those families, that just happened.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=782.929s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=783.669s">Hair,</a> hair. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=787.605s">I</a> am totally with you on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=789.248s">And</a> by the way, if anybody wants to comment, ask questions, we'll take those questions live. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=795.638s">So</a> feel free to just comment in the YouTube comment section. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=799.403s">Um,</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=800.804s">So</a> I know candidates are very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=803.365s">Um,</a> if you can stick around, um, and be on at the same time as, uh, like a little bit later as Paola and JT, um, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=812.549s">But</a> I also completely understand if there are other things that you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=816.851s">Um,</a> so, uh, so yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=819.113s">Uh,</a> if, is there any final words that you want to say, talk about in terms of, um, the Muslim community or the work that you're doing, uh, right now under COVID?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=870.645s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=871.785s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=874.387s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=874.847s">I</a> am going to bring in Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=881.264s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=883.206s">One</a> second, let me switch this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=886.289s">Paola,</a> you are live. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=888.631s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=889.652s">So</a> this is Paola Masoli with Mothers Out Front. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=892.515s">Paola,</a> if you can introduce yourself and a little bit about Mothers Out Front, that would be great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=905.441s">We</a> have a little bit of connectivity problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=914.898s">So</a> I don't know what your data reception is like right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=922.023s">Unfortunately,</a> we're getting a lot of sort of connectivity issues, so it's very difficult to understand you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=929.909s">Maybe</a> we can, let's try again in a second or two, or if there's a place near you that you get better data. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=935.753s">Ah,</a> you know... <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=943.445s">I</a> like the idea of doing it without video that maybe we'll get better audio. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=948.05s">Try</a> speaking again. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=954.936s">Unfortunately,</a> we just did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=959.08s">Yeah,</a> we are not able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=963.242s">It's</a> not understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=965.804s">So</a> we had had this idea earlier today that maybe we would just call you on the phone and we won't be able to see your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=976.911s">Or</a> maybe leave your... No, yeah, it's unfortunately just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=988.358s">We</a> might be able to, the video was actually not too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=991.68s">So</a> if you mute your audio, I'm gonna call you on the phone and we will have that play if that sounds good to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1001.428s">So</a> you're welcome to put your video up if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1005.611s">Otherwise,</a> we'll just go.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1014.9s">Great,</a> so we can hear you fine now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1029.585s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1030.445s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1031.765s">Um,</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1033.286s">So</a> I will just leave your name up here, but I'm going to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1038.222s">not</a> have your video on because we don't see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1043.049s">If</a> you want to turn your video on, that's fine, and I'll put you in there over Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1046.975s">So</a> yeah, Paola, go ahead and let us know sort of a little bit about you and about Mothers Out Front.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1154.262s">I</a> know, I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1155.562s">I</a> just wanted, like, because gas, when I think of gas, it's like gasoline for the car.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1273.951s">And</a> the Weymouth Compressor Station, as I understand, this five-year battle to prevent this new infrastructure for fossil fuels coming <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1285.918s">to</a> a not wealthy community in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1292.184s">Because</a> when you build new infrastructure, then the only way to get the money back from that investment is to do more fossil fuel extraction for the next 20 or 30 years.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1399.717s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1400.438s">And</a> can I ask you, I know that you've been particularly involved here in Somerville with the gas, the problem with gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1410.987s">So</a> natural gas, which is not natural, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1413.589s">The</a> methane that is pumped into our houses to supply heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1420.596s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1422.317s">that</a> the infrastructure in Somerville leaks, and in other places as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1428.303s">I</a> know it's a problem in Medford, and it's a problem across the state, that it leaks so much that, and I'm going to let you finish this sentence, how bad is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1437.091s">How</a> bad are these leaks in Somerville and Medford?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1605.784s">Great,</a> and as long as we have those, as long as we have gas flowing through those lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1612.875s">We've</a> got to fix them. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1613.956s">But</a> ideally, we move totally away from fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1619.681s">And</a> then we'll never need to repair those again.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1720.961s">And</a> we're one of the dense, like Somerville is one of the densest cities in the whole New England area. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1726.525s">So</a> the percentage of our housing that is new is small.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1802.396s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1804.417s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1806.63s">you</a> know, the work that you are doing here and that Luggage Out Front is doing all over the country is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1813.973s">I</a> know sort of, you know, uplifting the stories of like, you know, the health stories that have happened to people because of these gas leaks, because of the Weymouth Compressor Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1827.917s">And</a> also the trees, I remember you talking about, you know, these trees that have died and going there and actually testing the ground and finding that it's- <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1836.82s">So,</a> so much more gas in that soil than is allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1845.842s">So,</a> those things are really important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1848.063s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1955.084s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=1955.964s">Are</a> there any ways that people can get involved in Mothers Out Front?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2009.757s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2010.378s">I</a> love that you say more hands on deck because I always talk about it is an all hands on deck moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2016.124s">for</a> climate and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2018.746s">Well,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2020.407s">It's</a> been really great talking to you and hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2022.908s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2024.029s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2024.609s">Hearing</a> more about the work you guys are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2027.991s">So</a> glad that things are moving forward in terms of Somerville and we will keep pushing on the way with the compressor station. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2035.916s">So</a> yeah, thank you so much.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2047.936s">Me</a> too. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2048.897s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2049.317s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2049.977s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2050.838s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2051.518s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2052.419s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2052.879s">Bye-bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2053.399s">And</a> the next guest that we're going to have on is J.T. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2057.261s">Scott,</a> who is a Somerville city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2062.765s">I'm</a> going to remove Paola's name and move that front and put yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2069.329s">I've</a> got you in, JT. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2071.791s">JT,</a> how are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2072.932s">Yeah,</a> we don't have your audio.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2091.99s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2093.218s">Nothing</a> is as it was.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2164.377s">So</a> JT, I didn't even really introduce you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2167.578s">I</a> would love you to talk a little bit about who you are and really we're focusing on COVID-19 and how it's affecting Summerville and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2178.143s">And</a> if you can talk to us about what's happening at the city council now and what you guys are doing around COVID-19.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2213.898s">So</a> we've actually, we're having a little bit of trouble understanding you as well, JT. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2220.581s">Give</a> me just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2225.836s">How</a> is your data? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2241.221s">I</a> hate to say it, but I actually cannot understand you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2246.342s">It's</a> that bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2247.983s">It</a> makes me wonder if maybe it is my data, but I hope it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2253.865s">You</a> think it might be mine? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2256.4s">It</a> might be mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2257.48s">I</a> think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2264.123s">I'm</a> on a 5G network. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2265.784s">That's</a> usually pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2267.224s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2267.665s">I'm</a> actually going to move from my lovely background here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2270.686s">Background</a> will probably, hey, we're all in COVID-19, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2273.527s">So</a> everybody knows that you're at home and things look weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2277.348s">And</a> I'm going to plug right into the internet here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2280.75s">I'm</a> going to hardline it. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2284.538s">I</a> can get my lights to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2286.039s">There</a> we go.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2293.641s">Just</a> one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2295.602s">Oh,</a> and of course, my computer does not have this kind of jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2302.864s">Say</a> another couple things.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2324.399s">We're</a> all facing challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2325.68s">So</a> I am going to ask, I'm going to do something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2332.045s">Can</a> I have one of those? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2333.786s">Because</a> I can't hear through mine.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2339.337s">Okay,</a> so apparently everybody here is the same thing that I hear, which is that folks can hear me fine, but they can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2348.523s">Drat.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2350.344s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2350.924s">Here's</a> what I would love. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2351.965s">Because</a> this worked for Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2356.187s">Your</a> video is actually fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2358.669s">Totally</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2359.089s">Leave</a> your video on. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2360.67s">Mute</a> the audio. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2361.83s">We'll</a> have the audio by phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2363.591s">I</a> think that'll work great. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2379.485s">So</a> I have two numbers for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2380.606s">I'd</a> hate to read them off on, do you end in 3-2 or end in 2-1? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2383.729s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2405.553s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2406.934s">Okay,</a> so we can see you and now we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2410.036s">Wonderful.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2421.123s">The</a> best thing is if you can mute the computer completely, not just yourself, but also mute the computer and then use the phone for audio, that would work great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2505.497s">Well,</a> I'll ask you some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2506.858s">I</a> mean, I know that a lot of great things have been passed in terms of making sure that we're all safe, that the whole shutdown and all of that, and Somerville was very early on in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2520.51s">I</a> would love to look a little bit at the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2526.314s">What</a> is the plan, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2529.895s">How</a> are you guys handling the, do we have enough testing kits in Somerville? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2537.938s">Is</a> there any sort of a tracing plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2539.379s">Or</a> is that something that the state will really take care of? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2541.68s">How</a> does that side of things look from the city perspective?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2660.767s">Well</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2661.527s">Give</a> him a push there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2803.334s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2804.214s">Can</a> I, can I ask you a little question about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2806.695s">Like,</a> I think some of the stuff that Somerville has done amazingly well is to provide aid to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2812.936s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about, um, what, what sort of things are available, like even to people who are listening here, like what they can, how they can, um, look to the city of Somerville for some of their needs during COVID.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=2891.317s">I</a> know, they were the very first, our very first show was someone, one of the founders of Mamas.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3033.944s">So,</a> I could talk to you forever, and I'm wondering if you're okay with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3039.347s">I</a> would love to see if Paula and Nicole are still around. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3046.511s">So,</a> if Paula and Nicole, if you guys are still here, go ahead and turn on your video. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3052.795s">Paula,</a> hopefully we can get you in. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3054.395s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3055.796s">Nicole</a> is... Oh, good. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3057.857s">Let</a> me add Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3060.279s">Ah-ha-ha.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3063.204s">Fantastic.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3080.695s">And</a> I'm going to bring in a couple of seconds for you guys, and then I'll bring Paul in.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3231.096s">We</a> all love Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3231.756s">Who</a> doesn't love Mike?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3243.636s">You</a> know, I've never had four people on. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3248.939s">I</a> don't know how it's going to position people in the frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3253.082s">Let</a> me give it a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3254.103s">I'm</a> going to bring Paula in here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3256.124s">Aha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3257.505s">Hi.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3261.188s">Like</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3261.748s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3263.069s">I'm</a> just going to move the names around. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3264.63s">So</a> JT is over there.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3267.272s">Nicole</a> is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3269.478s">Paola</a> is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3270.659s">Oh,</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3273.3s">Good</a> to see everybody.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3419.933s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3421.174s">It's</a> funny because this is such a listening session. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3423.455s">Every</a> week I'm listening and hearing stories from the district and bringing in experts to figure out how we can solve these together. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3431.637s">So</a> I don't really talk about my race on the show, but now is my opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3434.818s">Thank</a> you, JT. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3437.259s">You</a> know, I'm running because I really believe that we cannot... I think the other side has the money and we have the people, but if that's true, we cannot win if we're preaching to the choir. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3450.768s">I</a> think we will not win a Green New Deal if we don't have a movement behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3454.17s">I</a> think we will not win Medicare for All if we don't have a movement behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3458.793s">I've</a> been training people for four years in a style of... <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3466.85s">build</a> movements through local electoral organizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3470.833s">And</a> I see the primary role of an elected official as a movement builder. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3479.179s">And</a> I think we must have movement builders as elected officials, because that is the only way that we will <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3487.914s">get</a> the policies that we want, need, and deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3491.336s">So</a> I am running to be a movement builder in the district and across the state with some very specific tactics that I learned from some amazing union organizers and other elected officials and other folks, very specific tactics that I've been training people in for years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3512.61s">And</a> I'm excited to do it as an elected official.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3668.623s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3669.202s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3670.964s">I</a> really could stay in this call for a long time, but I believe it or not, you know, candidates have busy schedules and I have a meeting starting now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3970.562s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3971.043s">Thank</a> you all so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3973.164s">It's</a> been wonderful talking to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3974.545s">Thanks</a> so much for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3977.525s">And</a> thanks for tuning in. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3978.569s">We</a> will be back in a couple weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/42F0MIWUWIo&t=3980.696s">Have</a> a good night.<h2><a href="../2020-05-06_n31pl_EctQM/2020-05-06_n31pl_EctQM.html">Solidarity LIVE!  Life as a musician under COVID in the US vs Canada.</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=2.056s">Hello,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=3.838s">Thank</a> you so much for tuning in to Solidarity Live, where we take stories and questions from the community here in Somerville and Medford, and then we bring in experts to talk about those issues, and we also figure out how we can solve these problems together as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=21.635s">So</a> today I'm actually quite excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=23.676s">I'm</a> going to be talking to a musician here in Somerville and the difficulties that you can imagine they have living under COVID, trying to live as a musician in the economic climate that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=39.559s">And</a> we also will have on a musician from Canada. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=42.3s">And</a> so we will talk about the differences there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=45.06s">So</a> I'm going to bring those folks in. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=47.731s">We</a> have with us James Lesuey. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=52.693s">I</a> hope I said that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=53.494s">You'll</a> be able to introduce yourself as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=56.075s">And</a> Kat McCleavey. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=57.835s">So</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=60.056s">You</a> are both live. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=62.057s">And</a> I'm going to go ahead and start with James. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=66.359s">So</a> if you want to just introduce yourself briefly and talk about what has happened in your life since the lockdown started. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=75.623s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=109.709s">Yeah,</a> and when we talked earlier, and by the way, I will just mention to you, it's a little bit awkward on the screen because all three of us are like, one, two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=118.255s">And</a> so you're very narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=120.757s">So</a> you're going to stay kind of in the center of the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=123.679s">But</a> yeah, stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=125.56s">So</a> James, when you and I had spoken earlier, you mentioned that you were doing a lot of music gigs and really kind of living the life of a musician. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=138.569s">But</a> that recently you had taken on the restaurant job because you wanted to be able to save money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=145.635s">You</a> didn't want to just meet your expenses, but you wanted to save. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=148.537s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about that and about the timing of when you took this job as well?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=232.996s">Yeah,</a> so both the music gigs and your restaurant job have really been shut down by the economic climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=242.4s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=242.82s">And</a> you are an opera performance major, is that right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=249.065s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=249.965s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=251.666s">So</a> I am going to... Well, before we switch over to what's happening in Canada, I just want to ask, if it's okay, how are you doing financially? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=265.173s">Can</a> you talk to us about, like, were you able to pay this month's rent? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=270.655s">And</a> how did you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=271.676s">And</a> then are you able to pay next month's rent? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=273.337s">Like,</a> what does it look like for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=274.477s">What</a> does the future look like for you?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=311.208s">The</a> second month- And that's a mutual aid, that's a mutual aid organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=314.29s">So</a> just reaching out to neighbors and people in the community.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=387.951s">Who</a> knows, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=389.032s">So</a> I mean your life is completely up in the air and it must be very stressful and you have no idea where you're gonna be able to pay your bills a couple months down the road.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=402.542s">I</a> am going to go ahead and switch over to Cat McLeavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=408.167s">So</a> you're both still on, but Cat, just introduce yourself and what's happening with you right now, especially since COVID.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=499.159s">They</a> had a little pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=501.217s">You</a> and James are both working musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=505.639s">You</a> both were in the Boston area, both, you know, graduated from music school and working as musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=517.244s">So</a> tell us what happened when the lockdown started and you're in Canada.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=747.293s">And</a> you have any medical issues that you have are covered because Canada essentially has a single-payer national Medicare for all style.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=814.182s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=816.195s">So</a> the other question that I want to bring up for you, James, is you had mentioned to me that you might look for work. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=828.883s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about that and about your concerns around that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=919.395s">We've</a> had, what, 30 million people file for unemployment in America since the start of COVID, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=926.599s">It</a> might be a total of 30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=928.2s">And,</a> you know, I, like, through talking to you and other people who really are facing this choice of, okay, I either get myself a job that is dangerous for my health or <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=949.251s">I</a> have no idea how I'm going to pay my rent and put food on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=952.615s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=954.337s">And</a> I think neither of you have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=956.139s">I</a> could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=956.639s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=956.939s">I</a> didn't ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=960.784s">But</a> for parents who have children they have to feed, it's yet another level of question there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=971.087s">And</a> I do worry that these, you know, the way America is set up, that we let everybody fend for themselves, that this lockdown situation is creating an environment where we allow people with white collar jobs to remain safely ensconced in their apartments, and everyone else has to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=999.675s">basically</a> become an essential worker serving those people and putting themselves in danger or else.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1011.699s">And</a> it doesn't have to be this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1013.459s">So</a> this is actually, this is the second, it's like a new segment on the show called It Doesn't Have To Be This Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1020.559s">You</a> know, I mean, same situation, two musicians, similar life stages, one in America, one in Canada. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1029.745s">It</a> does not have to be this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1033.567s">It</a> doesn't have to be this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1034.568s">Kat,</a> I assume you're not like running around, you know, thinking you're gonna have to get a job as an Amazon worker or a grocery store clerk in order to pay your bills.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1108.818s">And</a> that was because of city policy or national policy?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1148.912s">I</a> remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1152.696s">You</a> know what, though? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1154.297s">I'm</a> guessing that as soon as the lockdown happened, you would have high-tailed it to Canada. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1158.702s">You</a> know, last week, our It Doesn't Have to Be This Way segment... Here, my quotes didn't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1164.067s">The</a> It Doesn't Have to Be This Way segment was... <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1167.65s">It</a> was actually a guy who was living here in Somerville until the lockdowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1172.252s">And</a> two weeks after the lockdowns happened, he got a flight to South Korea because that's where his parents were. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1178.674s">He's</a> like born in America, but his parents are from South Korea and they happened to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1183.356s">And</a> they were like, you got to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1184.996s">And</a> now he's in South Korea. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1186.317s">And</a> guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1188.538s">He,</a> you know, he goes to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1191.039s">People</a> are going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1192.633s">people</a> are going out to restaurants and things, they have testing and contact tracing, they have everything under control, and they are leading normal lives because of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1206.121s">Because</a> their government has their head together. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1211.704s">Oh,</a> man. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1214.306s">So</a> I bet you would have gone.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1219.209s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1220.505s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1222.226s">Boy,</a> I am going to give you guys both an opportunity to say any final words, but I first just want to thank you so, so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1228.088s">James,</a> it's not like we have millions of viewers, but it takes bravery to let your personal story be out there for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1237.332s">And</a> I really, really appreciate you doing this, because there are many people in your shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1243.475s">And</a> personal stories motivate people to action. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1249.93s">And</a> I think it's really important that we get these stories out there so that people understand the gravity and the impact of policy and how much it affects people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1261.777s">So</a> I really, really appreciate you coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1264.099s">And</a> Cat, of course, love you dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1270.498s">We</a> were housemates. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1271.359s">I</a> don't know if people have really fully understood that, but we lived together for a whole year. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1274.521s">She's</a> wonderful, wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1275.802s">And</a> James, I know you're wonderful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1278.483s">We</a> don't have quite the same history. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1283.307s">And</a> so thank you so much, Kat, as well, for being on. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1285.668s">I'm</a> going to let you each say some final words. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1287.95s">Maybe,</a> Kat, why don't you go first?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1342.828s">Thank</a> you, my pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1343.728s">Wonderful</a> to have you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1345.249s">Stay</a> well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1347.511s">And</a> let's, you know, let's all get together and make some serious change because our country is in deep need of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1357.976s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1358.316s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1358.897s">Thanks,</a> everyone, for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1360.057s">We</a> will be signing off, and we will see you next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/n31pl_EctQM&t=1362.659s">Thanks</a> so much.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=0.051s">everyone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=0.511s">Thanks</a> for tuning in to Solidarity Live where we take questions and stories from the community in Somerville and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=9.058s">We</a> bring in experts to talk about those issues and then we work to solve those together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=14.062s">Today</a> I have on someone from the Welcome Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=17.765s">She's</a> going to talk all about everything they do with our immigrant community and a specific fund that she's working with today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=25.631s">And</a> I'm going to bring her right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=27.312s">So</a> this is <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=29.834s">Let</a> me have her join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=34.896s">Great,</a> this is Kenya Alfaro of The Welcome Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=40.819s">Hi,</a> Kenya, you're live.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=44.061s">Hi,</a> how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=45.581s">I'm</a> doing well, as well as I guess you can be right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=49.883s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=52.44s">I</a> would love for you to just tell us a little bit about what the Welcome Project does in general, and then specifically how you're dealing with COVID.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=143.311s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=143.972s">Um,</a> I will mention, I just got a comment from someone saying that there's a little bit of an echo, so I don't know if anybody's not muted or because we have people later in the show who are on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=154.239s">But</a> if you can mute, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=156.381s">Hopefully</a> this problem will resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=160.525s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=160.985s">So</a> it sounds like you guys really have good insight into our immigrant population and how they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=171.374s">And</a> I would love to hear as much as you can how our immigrant community is doing now during COVID.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=229.376s">You're</a> saying food resources are a problem because of just lack of funds, is that right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=273.069s">I</a> think it seems like you've frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=275.432s">Ah,</a> so give me one second, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=284.842s">It</a> looks like we had a little problem with Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=291.329s">Hang</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=322.491s">We</a> are just trying to get Kenya Alfaro back on from the Welcome Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=333.438s">I'm</a> going to go ahead and do what I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=349.268s">to</a> get Kenya back on, to get our folks from Tufts Mutual Aid back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=356.473s">They</a> are also, ah, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=359.615s">So</a> it looks like, ah, we have everyone back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=361.957s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=363.638s">So</a> sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=364.678s">I</a> do not know exactly what happened, but I lost all of you and my whole Skype went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=370.342s">So</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=372.223s">Thanks,</a> everyone, for sticking with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=374.605s">So</a> Kenya. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=377.047s">You</a> were talking about food resources and how the city of Somerville has really done some work there to make food resources available to people.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=416.758s">Right,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=418.34s">And</a> do you know if folks in that community have been plugging into the mutual aid, so the Medford and Somerville mutual aid, or in any of the other cities' mutual aid projects?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=480.8s">Great,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=482.381s">And</a> you have a particular fund that you administer, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=486.003s">Do</a> you want to talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=617.843s">I'll</a> just remind people that if you have any questions, you can just put those in the comment box and we can pull those right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=626.829s">In</a> your outreach, you guys must have a lot of languages on hand, I imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=631.892s">When</a> you're calling through people, how many different languages do you have to rely on to reach out to people?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=712.679s">Great,</a> that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=714.08s">And</a> are there ways that people can help? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=716.002s">I</a> mean, it sounds like people can donate to that fund specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=718.645s">And</a> the fund I assume is like directly related to COVID and it started with COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=724.171s">And</a> so it really has to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=725.733s">Are</a> there other ways in addition to that, that people can help?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=806.78s">Yeah,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=807.881s">It</a> sounds like at one point there was a need for masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=810.563s">I</a> know <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=811.576s">you</a> know, a lot of folks and mamas are excited to make masks, so I don't know if that's something that people still need.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=825.989s">Let's</a> be clear, there's a new law in Somerville saying that when out of your house, you must wear a mask, and there's a fine, up to $300, I think, fine related to that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=902.89s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=903.19s">Do</a> you want to give just a little plug for how people can find you, how people can donate to the fund, or help out in other ways? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=910.863s">Specifically,</a> what's the website?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=955.59s">Wow,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=956.93s">Great</a> work that you guys are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=959.531s">Wonderful</a> to have you on and keep us updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=962.572s">Let</a> us know as things change, if there are more needs and other ways that people can help.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=969.955s">Thank</a> you, great to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=973.756s">So</a> our next guests are from, hang on, we're gonna add, from Tufts Mutual Aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=985.642s">We</a> have, I'm getting closer, here we go, Madeline Clark and <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1000.211s">Nikhil</a> and Nikhil, I'm gonna let you say your name because I think I might get it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1005.572s">And</a> you know what, I hope that you two will introduce Tufts Mutual Aid and introduce yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1012.033s">And</a> somehow my computer is not plugged in, like it's plugged in to my, and my battery's gonna die. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1017.614s">So</a> I'm gonna duck out for just one second in this COVID home studio here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1023.455s">But</a> why don't you go ahead and introduce Tufts Mutual Aid and yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1029.902s">I</a> have you live now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1034.264s">But</a> I think you're muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1035.004s">Ah,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1035.604s">Nikhil,</a> great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1109.379s">So</a> can you tell us some of the stories that you've heard as you've been working with the folks that you're working with? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1117.185s">What</a> do you hear from people? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1122.429s">What's</a> happening in their lives as a result of these changes?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1255.929s">We</a> have a question from Joel Greenberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1259.411s">He</a> says, how much notice were people given to move off campus? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1263.514s">Seems</a> like a huge burden for students and families.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1343.8s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1345.48s">And</a> would you say, I mean, obviously you don't know numbers, but maybe you do, like what percentage of tough students actually had to leave town, like had to find, like were on campus and had to find somewhere else and ended up maybe going home?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1437.252s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1437.532s">And</a> so, you know, it's interesting because when I <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1440.478s">When</a> I first heard of Tufts Mutual Aid, I thought, okay, it's like, you know, the other mutual aid societies helping provide, you know, helping people make sure they're safe, that they can pay their rent, that they can get groceries and things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1455.932s">But</a> it sounds like you are also pretty deeply involved in making sure that students who have to now continue their education, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1465.927s">are</a> able to do that part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1468.729s">So,</a> like, how do you balance those? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1474.313s">Or,</a> you know, what do you feel has been happening for students who have to continue their education, have to do everything online? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1486.061s">Like,</a> how disruptive has that been to their education? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1489.524s">Maybe</a> talk about that side, just the educational aspect of it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1780.761s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1782.262s">So</a> just a last question about the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1787.567s">So</a> the making sure people can get groceries, they can pay for their rent, all of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1794.772s">Have</a> you seen, for the students that remain, are you interfacing at all with mamas, with another different mutual aid? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1803.76s">Is</a> this mostly students helping students? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1806.062s">How</a> are you able to help <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1810.365s">those</a> students who are in the area to be able to sort of afford the changing circumstances that are happening to them now, but specifically like rent, food, the basics?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=1950.77s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2004.799s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2007.061s">All</a> right, how can, what can people do? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2009.163s">I</a> mean, does it like, like it really has been, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2012.128s">the</a> Tufts Mutual Aid is the students helping the students, students who have moved, leaving food, and the graduate students helping in the, you know, so are there ways that other people in the community can be helpful, and what would that be?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2129.791s">And</a> how can people reach you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2130.771s">Is</a> there a website? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2131.512s">Is</a> there an email address people can reach out to? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2134.113s">A</a> phone number? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2134.533s">Anything?</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2278.374s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2279.094s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2279.674s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2280.274s">Thanks</a> both of you for coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2281.955s">It's</a> really great to hear about, you know, this part of our community that we probably don't hear a lot about, you know, outside of the Tufts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2292.518s">really</a> great work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2293.759s">Thank</a> you for for doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2295.879s">And</a> thanks for being on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2301.081s">All</a> right, so our next person, and I'm just gonna click click here for a minute or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2311.405s">Okay,</a> we now have someone who is from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2316.967s">But</a> it's currently in South Korea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2319.979s">And</a> I don't know how many people listening know about South Korea and the way that they have dealt with COVID, but it's very different from how the US has dealt with COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2332.881s">And</a> so here is Howard Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2336.602s">I'm</a> just going to pop your name up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2338.562s">And</a> you are live. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2342.203s">So</a> Howard, it's great to see you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2347.144s">Thanks</a> for coming on.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2468.108s">When</a> you say you're hearing this news, you mean in America?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2528.283s">Yeah,</a> what I've heard is that it was, at first, you could only get tested, even if you had symptoms, you could only get tested if you had a known contact, if you'd been in contact with someone who was known to have had COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2540.489s">That</a> was how limited the testing was, and now, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2543.87s">Then</a> it was if you had symptoms of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2548.752s">They're</a> loosening it up a little bit, but it is still very difficult to get a test.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2588.62s">I</a> was just going to ask if the test results had come back yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2590.84s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2591.0s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2593.261s">Get</a> the test back.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2664.788s">So</a> even though you were tested and your test came back after one day, did they ask you to stay indoors for two weeks or did they just give you two weeks worth of food and then tell you you could go out?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2731.498s">So</a> you had two weeks of staying at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2735.0s">You</a> got tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2736.14s">Your</a> test came back negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2738.241s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2738.421s">And</a> then you were at home for two weeks, maybe because there's some chance that you could have had, and it hadn't shown up yet on the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2746.205s">For</a> whatever reason, you stayed home for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2749.346s">And</a> after that time, now tell us what is your life like?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2782.858s">Now,</a> when you were staying at your parents' house, did they have to stay home?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2793.6s">OK,</a> great.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2836.321s">But</a> restaurants, coffee shops?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2980.769s">Can</a> I ask you, where does South Korea get all these tests? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2987.493s">We</a> cannot seem to get tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2989.494s">You</a> may not even know this, <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=2991.756s">Why</a> is there such a difference in the ability for people in South Korea to access tests than people like in Somerville, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3000.143s">Why</a> can we not access tests here?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3197.653s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3199.515s">Can</a> I ask, does South Korea have a national healthcare system?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3320.646s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3321.746s">It</a> is such an amazing story. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3324.087s">And</a> I'm so glad that you started with the personal story of your own experience living in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3331.81s">And</a> I had not realized that you were here when COVID started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3336.772s">And</a> you decided to go to South Korea knowing that the South Korean reaction to this was going to be much better, was much better, and that you would be both safer <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3348.7s">and</a> more free to go about your normal daily life in South Korea than here?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3412.276s">And</a> now in Somerville, you would be forced to work remotely anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3415.478s">Like</a> you would still be having to work remotely right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3446.898s">But</a> South Korea's response sounds like it's just a lot more sustainable than ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3452.701s">Because</a> you guys are going about mostly about your normal business, but with the testing and tracing program that they have, the contact tracing program, they can contain it very well, while most people are kind of going about their daily lives, and the economy is not under a huge hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3471.167s">Does</a> that sound about right?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3503.145s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3503.525s">We'll</a> have to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3504.405s">I</a> really have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3505.625s">We'll</a> check on that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3507.466s">It</a> might be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3508.146s">I</a> mean, hey, we're in the US where medical things cost ridiculous amounts of money.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3524.672s">South</a> Korean ones or United States?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3537.981s">We'll</a> get to our experts and we'll ask about that here as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3554.01s">So</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3554.97s">So</a> we have something to look forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3558.031s">We</a> can get life back to normal and keep this thing under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3562.752s">So</a> it has been really eye-opening to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3566.453s">I</a> appreciate you coming on so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3568.454s">And</a> I have to say, it is kind of amazing that your Skype feed is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3574.612s">half</a> a world away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3576.314s">So,</a> good job Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3578.075s">Yeah,</a> no kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3581.257s">So</a> yeah, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3582.178s">Do</a> you have any last, any final words before we let you go?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3591.484s">Really,</a> really fascinating to hear about what life is like there for you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3597.468s">And</a> I hope we get there soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3599.77s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7DGFfLK0-RE&t=3600.45s">Great</a> to talk to you.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=243.358s">So</a> that's what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=248.219s">That</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=249.359s">Really</a> needed work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=252.062s">Do</a> you have an idea of how many folks you interact with as a homeless population in need on a daily or weekly basis?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=359.314s">Yeah,</a> that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=362.837s">Can</a> you talk about how COVID-19 is affecting the people that you're helping?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=485.021s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=488.422s">What</a> do you think is the best way for people to be able to help out? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=494.243s">Where</a> can they donate? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=496.643s">Can</a> they volunteer? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=497.604s">Are</a> there other ways that they can help?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=564.308s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=566.764s">Do</a> you have any final thoughts, anything else that you want people to know about what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=573.288s">Oh,</a> you know, I heard on WBUR there was a segment on homeless shelters, and all I remember is hearing that they had gotten enough tests to test an entire homeless shelter, like every single person in the shelter, and that some crazy high percentage of them <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=596.37s">One</a> in three. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=597.431s">Yeah,</a> that's what I remember, but I didn't want to quote it because it seems so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=601.734s">But</a> a lot of them were asymptomatic and they didn't show signs of the disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=606.918s">What</a> do you think that that means?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=675.229s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=675.969s">And</a> so it sounds like the program that you have where you actually house people is the safest for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=682.851s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=683.851s">In</a> addition to being obviously the best for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=687.732s">When</a> you can house people and they can have their own home, it's clearly better for many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=691.713s">But</a> here in COVID-19, it's even more crucial.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=711.145s">Well,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=713.726s">The</a> work you guys do is totally amazing, and I don't envy you the amount of work that you have to do these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=723.148s">So,</a> you know, we will be encouraging people to help you out, to volunteer and donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=727.969s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=730.17s">Yeah,</a> it's really good to have an update, and stay safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=736.311s">Do</a> personal care. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=737.371s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=738.412s">Everything</a> that you need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=741.452s">And</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=742.173s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=743.953s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=744.774s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=746.274s">I'm</a> going to go ahead and bring on David Tissell from the Somerville Community Corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=756.838s">Let</a> me just switch the titles here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=760.92s">Here</a> he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=761.32s">Hey,</a> we've got you on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=763.441s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=763.501s">Hey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=763.961s">Hi,</a> Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=767.83s">Thanks</a> for being on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=769.111s">I</a> would love to hear a little bit about what the Somerville Community Corporation does and your role specifically.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=860.235s">You're</a> getting close.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=872.721s">Yeah,</a> that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=876.106s">I</a> mean, it seems like there's only a certain amount of new construction you can do in the densest city in the whole of New England.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=911.777s">Yeah,</a> that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=914.279s">So</a> I'd love to hear how COVID-19 is affecting your organizing, is affecting your tenants, like what do you see happening?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1057.013s">Is</a> that something new to COVID-19 or is that something that existed before?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1066.571s">So</a> can you talk just a little bit more about that in case there are people listening who might be interested in looking into that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1127.878s">Okay,</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1129.239s">You</a> know, it's funny, shortly before this call, I happened to be talking to my mom who lives in California, and she was saying that Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1143.15s">you</a> know, had very recently given a speech or a talk where he was saying that 10% of Californians are undocumented and that these undocumented workers were the people growing the food, were the people <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1162.074s">delivering</a> the food and other essentials, they were the people working in the grocery stores, that these are the essential workers, and that he was going to ensure that they had medical care, that they were all gonna get unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1177.944s">And</a> I just wanna, I haven't looked into that from a policy, like I don't know what exact policies he passed, because I literally just got off the phone with her, but I'd love to hear from you a little bit about your thoughts on that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1245.579s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1247.74s">Are</a> there other ways that people can get involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1251.831s">can</a> help out in the work that you guys are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1256.133s">Tell</a> us what we can do as far as... Yeah, thanks.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1331.884s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1332.785s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1334.447s">Thank</a> you so much, David. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1335.788s">Great</a> to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1336.568s">Thanks,</a> Hannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1338.35s">And</a> thanks for coming on and talking about the great work that you guys do.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1345.434s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1345.914s">We</a> are going to wrap up this episode with having my sister come on one more time because there are always updates in the medical community and we want to know what is happening <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1368.089s">with</a> our medical personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1369.39s">What</a> is happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1370.17s">How</a> are doctors and nurses doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1373.131s">How</a> are hospitals doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1374.332s">Are</a> they able to cope with the stress of all of the new patients? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1378.033s">Are</a> there enough beds? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1378.754s">Are</a> there enough ventilators? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1380.675s">What</a> are the numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1381.835s">Tell</a> us your updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1385.797s">And</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1386.937s">I</a> asked all these questions, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1388.378s">People</a> who didn't see the episode two weeks ago, please introduce yourself.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1537.323s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1539.375s">That's</a> incredible that all these beds have been built. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1542.337s">It's</a> really amazing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1578.244s">And</a> I know there was a ballot measure recently to limit the number of patients that nurses would have to deal with at a time, and that didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1591.911s">Do</a> you have any sense of whether, I mean, obviously there's no avoiding in a pandemic that people are gonna have more patients, doctors are gonna have more patients, nurses are gonna have more patients, everybody, you know, and some medical health professionals <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1605.218s">are</a> going to get sick and be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1608.221s">So</a> as far as just the medical professionals, are people working crazy hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1615.968s">I</a> know there was some sort of rotation happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1618.531s">How</a> is that working out?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1701.295s">With</a> drive-through testing, how long does it take to get the test results? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1705.216s">Or</a> are you just getting tested and then you get the results later?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1758.032s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1759.913s">How</a> is it going with personal protective equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1762.616s">I</a> know that's something that you see in the news all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1765.498s">There's</a> not enough equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1766.719s">People</a> are having to wear the same mask for many shifts in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1769.642s">Has</a> that changed?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1840.243s">Okay,</a> that is good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1841.823s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1844.104s">I</a> would love to, first let me ask if you have other thoughts, if you have other things that you think people might find interesting?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1885.409s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1886.81s">And</a> I'm just going to go ahead and have you finish up with a reminder, like washing hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1895.119s">What</a> is a reminder of what is the proper, how do we best protect ourselves and others?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=1998.756s">That</a> is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2000.476s">Thanks</a> so much for that tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2001.577s">That</a> is really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2003.157s">Hopefully</a> we'll soon get enough testing that everybody can know whether they have it, whether they had it, if they have been interacting with someone who has it or had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2015.899s">So</a> hopefully we'll be there very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2020.404s">Great,</a> thank you so much for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2022.645s">It's</a> really great to hear about how the medical community is coping and that it seems like it's going okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2027.627s">We're</a> not gonna be totally overwhelmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2029.028s">Yay!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2031.889s">And</a> of course, thank you for being the front lines of this fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2036.351s">It</a> is really, you guys are all the heroes of the coronavirus. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2045.602s">We're</a> glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2047.367s">We're</a> glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2048.169s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2048.891s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2049.754s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2054.533s">I</a> think that is the end of our show this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2057.575s">As</a> I mentioned before, please do send us your stories of how COVID-19 is affecting you, is affecting your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2068.28s">Let</a> us know what sorts of issues we can dig into, what things you're interested in, and we will bring people on to talk about those issues to uplift the stories of what's happening to people in our community and to try and solve things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nqx7ioWHe0&t=2084.468s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2020-04-01_oH-z1fqOxl0/2020-04-01_oH-z1fqOxl0.html">Solidarity LIVE! Medford City Councillor, expert on SNAP, COVID and incarceration.</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=0.031s">everyone,</a> thanks for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2.192s">Here</a> we are on Solidarity Live. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=4.073s">This</a> is our second week. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=6.814s">We're</a> talking about how COVID-19 is affecting Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=13.476s">So</a> I have the great pleasure of having Medford City Councilor Zach Baers here with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=19.75s">Zach,</a> first I would love to have you just introduce yourself and maybe say a little bit about what is happening at the Medford City Council now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=177.609s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=177.91s">So</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=178.57s">One</a> thing that I really want to do in every episode is, in case there are people, probably everybody's gotten the memo, but in case there are people who haven't gotten the memo, just how serious this is and why it's important to what they call social distancing, which I wish they were calling physical distancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=195.003s">I</a> pass people on the street, like I'm walking with my son or something, and we're like more than six feet away, and I'm like, hey, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=204.167s">And</a> some people are really friendly and some people are like, meh. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=207.328s">So</a> physical distancing, why is it really important and what are we facing?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=358.492s">By</a> the way, I just got a comment that says if it's okay for you to mute your own computer, either put in the headphones or mute your own computer screen while you're speaking, that there's a little bit of... Sure.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=374.336s">I</a> have headphones in, so yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=379.274s">If</a> the other, we also have two other folks who are on Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=383.657s">I</a> don't know if it matters if they mute, if, you know, if they're in headphones or mute, that would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=389.942s">That</a> might make a difference.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=392.724s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=393.445s">I</a> bet I can probably mute her if she is not muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=398.228s">Hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=399.73s">It's</a> not as easy as in Zoom, but Caroline, if you're listening, if you could mute, that would be awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=405.174s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=407.592s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=407.852s">And</a> so, you know, one thing I want to emphasize is that the real danger here is the idea that we may overwhelm the hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=416.959s">So</a> that's what, like, big picture-wise, that, I think, is what we're trying to avoid and why social distancing, why it's worth it to, like, literally almost crash our economy temporarily, because if we don't do this, <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=432.292s">you</a> have so many people going to the hospitals that you literally just don't have enough ventilators and beds and doctors to treat them. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=438.876s">And</a> then there's no treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=440.437s">And</a> if there's no treatment, then people simply, they just, a ton of people will die. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=444.179s">So</a> that's kind of the reasoning why it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=447.841s">And</a> if you can, you know, we've talked about this a little bit last week, but if you have some notes of hope for people who may <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=458.107s">realize</a> how bad it is and be at home feeling very down about things, that this maybe won't be forever, like what is your sense of us pulling out of this?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=637.473s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=640.497s">I'm</a> really interested in hearing a little bit more from you about the two sort of avenues that you talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=649.127s">One</a> is direct payments and the other is freezing the economy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=654.653s">So</a> I know <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=656.455s">In</a> Denmark, they're paying every worker 75% of their income, I believe, for the time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=662.54s">Just</a> the government, that's the way that they're handling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=666.444s">But</a> in Boston, there is a new movement for Massachusetts, I believe it's called Housing Guarantee, that's talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=679.485s">in</a> addition to a moratorium on mortgage payments, having some sort of a cancellation of rent for people who are unable to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=688.767s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about either of those? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=692.428s">Talk</a> either about the freezing economy or about the direct payments side?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=789.337s">By</a> the payment stuff, you don't mean direct payments from the government, you mean... Sorry, I mean... Freezing.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=901.565s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=904.366s">Anything</a> else going on at the city level?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1019.439s">Yeah,</a> we've seen that on the mamas list, the Mutual Aid Medford and Centerville, that people are helping with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1025.721s">And</a> they also have a lot of good advice about how to, wearing gloves, washing before you go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1032.623s">And</a> that if you're leaving something in the pantry, that you want to do that safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1037.525s">So</a> that even if you're completely asymptomatic, that you're not leaving something for someone that could potentially infect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1043.827s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1045.627s">So</a> I know that there are a lot of good people who are helping to fill those as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1078.283s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1081.004s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1082.725s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1083.246s">So</a> we actually do have a food insecurity person who's just about to come on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1088.929s">And</a> I wanted to ask if you have any final words for people <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1094.904s">for</a> this week before we go to the next guest.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1124.942s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1125.182s">Do</a> you want to say one more time the website that people can go to for Medford?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1135.87s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1136.671s">Thank</a> you so much for being on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1138.292s">It's</a> great to hear about the great work that you guys are doing there and chat a little bit also about state and federal policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1146.118s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1148.28s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1149.281s">We're</a> going to go ahead and switch to Becca Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1154.506s">Becca,</a> I've got you on screen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1156.648s">I'm</a> going to switch out the name so that you don't look like you're Zack Bares. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1161.932s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1162.753s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1164.635s">So</a> first, I would love for you to introduce yourself before I kind of read the story that led me to invite you on here.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1198.116s">Thanks</a> for all the great work that you are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1201.438s">So</a> I would like to just go ahead and read. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1204.44s">Someone</a> sent an email to the show, and they wanted me to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1210.364s">So</a> this is someone who says, I am a 58-year-old disabled Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1215.227s">My</a> doctor advised me to shelter in place due to my congenital lung disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1219.45s">When</a> attempting to set up an online grocery delivery, I discovered that Massachusetts does not allow SNAP EBT recipients this necessary service. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1227.573s">Why</a> is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1228.513s">This</a> presents a very dangerous choice to high-risk individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1231.715s">Go</a> hungry or expose oneself to a potentially fatal infection. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1235.796s">Please</a> explain.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1388.115s">Yeah,</a> and also you had mentioned when I first asked you about this that the HIP program, you actually can order fresh produce through the HIP program for delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1400.302s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1474.883s">Yeah,</a> that's an amazing program that Massachusetts has. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1478.904s">And</a> can you either, like, do you happen to know the phone number for Project Bread, or is there a website for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1485.288s">Like,</a> where can people find this information?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1517.15s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1519.071s">I'm</a> slightly curious just about the tech issue that you talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1524.293s">So</a> when you're saying that we can't get it here in Massachusetts, I understand the issue with Amazon and Walmart being the two options in the five states that do have it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1537.312s">That's</a> not perfect, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1542.753s">But</a> what's the tech issue between us and getting at least those two who are piloting it in other states to be able to deliver to people in Massachusetts?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1593.651s">Okay,</a> at least we've got HIP here, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1597.132s">Do</a> you have any final thoughts for folks who either may have some, either are on SNAP or maybe aren't on SNAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1606.435s">For</a> example, who's eligible for SNAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1608.796s">And</a> would people now who have lost their jobs, maybe they would be eligible for SNAP and they don't know? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1614.738s">Who</a> can apply?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1705.619s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1707.079s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1707.559s">Well,</a> thank you so much, Becca. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1709.599s">It's</a> been great to have you on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1711.82s">And</a> again, for the work that you do, always. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1715.0s">And</a> I think we are about to start a conversation about incarcerated folks in Massachusetts and how they are dealing with SNAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1723.742s">So</a> thank you, Becca. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1725.042s">We're</a> going to say ciao to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1729.263s">I'm</a> going to invite on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1733.299s">Carolyn</a> Bayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1734.74s">Great,</a> Carolyn, you are live. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1740.084s">I</a> fear that I have a frozen version of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1744.146s">Hang</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1746.968s">Yeah,</a> Carolyn, we might have to reopen our phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1758.176s">You</a> might have to dial in again. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1759.577s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1768.625s">Let</a> me see if I can get Carolyn on the horn here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1771.447s">Meanwhile,</a> I will say you can always send in your stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1776.231s">You</a> can send in your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1777.672s">You</a> can comment on YouTube, and I can see all those comments, so we can bring those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1784.137s">There</a> is Becca again. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1787.119s">Hi,</a> how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1787.74s">I'm</a> going to try and get Carolyn on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1790.142s">Let</a> me call her back. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1800.977s">Aha,</a> she is calling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1815.705s">Pardon</a> me, I have a little bit of an issue with Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1823.01s">Give</a> me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1824.711s">Trying</a> to get Caroline on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1834.537s">Let</a> me, I don't have your video, but I do have your audio. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1840.562s">Ah,</a> I've got you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1842.784s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1845.266s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1845.826s">So</a> first, we're gonna talk about how COVID-19 is affecting folks in jails. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1852.672s">And</a> I would love it if you would go ahead and just introduce yourself and how you are sort of related to this topic.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1908.836s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1909.396s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1910.337s">Before</a> we talk a little bit more generally about what's happening, well, you tell me, do you want to talk generally about what's happening in Massachusetts prisons? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1919.803s">Or</a> do you want to go, should we just go straight at what's happening related to COVID-19? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1924.206s">I</a> think let's start with COVID-19 and why it's so dangerous for them at this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=1928.288s">And</a> then we can broaden it up a little bit after this.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2020.541s">Do</a> you mean that the prisoners themselves are spending their own money to buy soap?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2037.44s">So</a> before you go on, I do want to just mention we have someone who's commented on YouTube saying they're hoping to hear about what correctional facilities are doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2050.223s">And</a> so it sounds like one thing that they're doing is they seem to have obtained masks, which it's so incredibly important for our, like there's a shortage of masks, and it's so important for our hospital staff and doctors to be able to have the masks that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2065.806s">And</a> of course, it's important for correctional facilities to have masks as well, but not if they're just wearing them around their neck and using it to, you know, taunt the inmates.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2153.08s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2153.6s">So</a> I'm going to jump in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2155.481s">I</a> can't resist jumping in here because I did spend two nights in jail in 2000 when I was illegally arrested for protesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2165.524s">There</a> were about 71 of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2167.844s">We</a> were illegally strip searched. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2170.625s">The</a> women only were strip searched twice during our time there, and there was a giant lawsuit afterwards and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2176.127s">But</a> I will say that this was in Los Angeles, and I will say that we were <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2181.828s">we</a> were arrested and literally not allowed to wash in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2187.211s">And</a> the police who had arrested us had us leaning up against, like, pushing us against a chain link fence that was, like, covered in grease and oil because it was right directly underneath a freeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2199.456s">And</a> so our hands and our bodies were just, they had all this black grease all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2205.639s">And</a> we were not, there was no, <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2208.72s">ability</a> for us to wash anything at all for like, you know, 30 hours or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2214.768s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2217.902s">And</a> the whole taunting thing, people may not realize how much psychological games are played to inmates by correctional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2232.727s">So</a> the idea that correctional staff are joking about purposefully getting inmates sick with COVID-19, that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2246.312s">You</a> know, when this is real psychological. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2250.435s">I</a> mean, it's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2251.556s">That</a> should not be legal for them to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2254.418s">And</a> then I want to, for a second, before we go on, to talk a little bit about how dangerous it is to be in these close quarters with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2265.044s">I</a> mean, we're talking about social distancing, and people who are incarcerated do not have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2273.67s">So</a> can you talk a little bit just about how dangerous it is and if there have been any outbreaks inside of any correctional facilities?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2367.272s">We</a> have another question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2370.676s">Are</a> there ways for people to get involved and support the incarcerated population during this time of crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2376.784s">Canteen</a> money for soap, masks, letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2379.026s">I</a> am sympathetic to those who are in prisons.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2439.411s">And</a> before we go on to the next questions, we do have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2443.453s">You're</a> saying that letters and emails are really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2446.614s">Is</a> there a particular easy way? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2449.456s">I</a> know that a lot of people who are involved in Mamas Mutually Medford and Somerville are, people want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2456.819s">People</a> want to be able to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2458.64s">What's</a> an easy way for people to get involved that way?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2524.8s">And</a> I assume we can't do that right now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2528.723s">Visiting,</a> yeah, there's no visiting, right.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2583.958s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2585.099s">There</a> is another question, which is, do you know what sort of medical care is available in case someone in prison does get the virus?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2637.943s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2639.525s">So,</a> you know, I've heard, I know that a couple of our city councilors here in Somerville, Ben, you and Kevin and JT Scott, and as well as other people have been talking about releasing certain portions of the prison population. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2654.358s">Certainly</a> the the ones who are oh, what's I'm forgetting the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2658.4s">I</a> I sometimes call it debtors prison, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2660.861s">It's</a> people who their pretrial detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2663.382s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2663.762s">So</a> they they haven't been convicted of anything and they just can't pay bail. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2668.024s">And</a> so they're held in jail.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2696.743s">It</a> is so insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2698.884s">It's</a> really mind-blowing to me that this is true in America today.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2754.605s">Is</a> there some way that we can pressure people? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2758.086s">Is</a> there a way that folks listening here can help with that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2801.411s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2802.871s">Do</a> you want to talk a little bit about, we've talked a lot about COVID-19 and how it's affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2809.193s">Can</a> you talk to us a little bit about what you were working on before COVID-19 and about solitary confinement?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2865.354s">How</a> is that legal?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2906.491s">And</a> by the way, I think you once mentioned to me the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2910.593s">Isn't</a> there a limit under the sort of world human rights? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2917.475s">Who</a> has a limit that's... Oh, 15 days.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2959.74s">That</a> is totally insane.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2962.301s">That's</a> horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2963.121s">Horrifying.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2978.823s">So,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2979.864s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2983.328s">Well,</a> let's end on a slightly better note than that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2993.104s">Do</a> you have any better notes than that one in terms of the incarcerated population? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=2997.608s">Like,</a> what do you... Is there anything on the horizon? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3000.631s">Are</a> there any bills that you think are happening right now, maybe at the state level, that have a good chance of passing? <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3007.198s">Or,</a> you know, Rachel Rollins, you know, she seems pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3011.562s">And</a> maybe through our elected DAs, we're going to be having some positive movement.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3055.752s">That's</a> exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3057.292s">That</a> is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3058.393s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3059.813s">Thank</a> you so much for coming on today and for talking about this incredibly important, I think, too often overlooked topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3067.435s">And</a> also for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3069.375s">Oh,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3072.536s">It's</a> really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3073.316s">I'm</a> going to actually go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3074.516s">I'm</a> going to see if I can get some mamas folks to <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3080.098s">some</a> momma's folks to start writing letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3081.92s">We</a> have one final comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3086.704s">As</a> the mother of a previously incarcerated, I agree with Caroline when she says the medical care is lax. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3092.409s">Inmates</a> are often not taken seriously and there are longer than average wait times for care. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3099.613s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3100.814s">So</a> medical care in prisons, important topic, especially now. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3107.078s">But</a> yeah, we're going to see if we can get some folks to write some letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3111.1s">And</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3112.921s">Great</a> to talk to you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3116.779s">So</a> just to close this out, you can always, as you can see, we take comments over YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3122.943s">We</a> really want to elevate people's stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3127.245s">So</a> if you have a story, if anything has been happening to you because of COVID-19, if you've been affected by either the health <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3135.449s">crisis</a> that we have or if you have been affected economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3139.792s">We</a> know a lot of people in the district have. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3141.574s">We</a> know there are a lot of students in Medford and Somerville who had to leave school and either are stuck having to pay rent where they're not living or are stuck not having a place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3157.887s">and</a> then having to find places to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3161.63s">So</a> if you have any stories, please send them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3165.954s">We</a> can talk about them anonymously. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3167.395s">We</a> can have you on the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3168.636s">I</a> really believe that good policy is based on <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3173.94s">uh,</a> hearing directly from what's happening to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3178.941s">Um,</a> and so, uh, I also think that we help people understand why policy is necessary by really elevating these stories, um, so that we all understand, uh, how policy affects our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3192.043s">So</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3193.484s">Um,</a> great to have everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3195.964s">And</a> that is the end of today's show. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3197.465s">We</a> will be back next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/oH-z1fqOxl0&t=3199.685s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2020-03-25_GgIhz_QS2tk/2020-03-25_GgIhz_QS2tk.html">Solidarity LIVE!

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=0.552s">So</a> it looks like we are live. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2.514s">I</a> want to say hello to everybody who's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=4.356s">I</a> see that Hannah is a little bit frozen, so I'm going to go ahead and switch her over. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=14.106s">Hey,</a> we've got her. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=16.028s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=17.289s">So</a> I'm Anna Callahan, and I have with me Hannah Friedman. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=24.02s">who</a> has been doing just amazing work with mutual aid Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=30.547s">So</a> fantastic, really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=33.59s">So</a> Hannah, I would love to have you just say a little bit about who you are and how MAMAS, Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville started.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=143.973s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=145.174s">So</a> we're going to talk more about mamas in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=151.658s">I</a> thought we might open up with a couple of public service announcements. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=157.582s">And</a> I don't know if you've had a chance to read these. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=160.444s">There</a> have been some Medium posts that became very popular by a guy named Tomas Pueyo. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=167.709s">I'm</a> not sure that I pronounced that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=169.49s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=172.831s">Oh,</a> and by the way, if you're watching on YouTube, you can just write a question or a comment and then we can see those and we'll answer people as this goes on live. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=183.196s">So</a> in the first Medium post that he made, it's called Coronavirus, Why You Must Act Now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=190.282s">That</a> one is really about how serious this is and the importance of social distancing or what I like to call physical distancing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=200.09s">We</a> need to be physically distant from each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=203.533s">Keeping</a> six feet of space, not touching things other people have touched, just the <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=208.237s">the</a> reality of how incredibly contagious coronavirus is and how important it is that we slow down, we like flatten the curve, as I say, we slow down the number of people who are infected because of the fear of overwhelming our hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=231.336s">So</a> I don't know if you have any thoughts about that.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=241.814s">You</a> seem good, I can hear you.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=266.355s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=266.775s">So</a> I just wanted to kind of start this off in case there are people who don't really understand the magnitude of the crisis that we're in and why people are doing all these measures, like why all the schools have been shut down, why all the restaurants have been shut down, you know, why all of this stuff is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=285.77s">that</a> it really is critical that we not overwhelm our hospitals, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=291.033s">But</a> the other one, and he did a second post after he got many millions of views on that first post, and basically it's talking about what does this look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=301.998s">Do</a> we have to stay indoors, socially isolated from each other for six months or a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=306.761s">For</a> people who are maybe aware of how bad it is and want to not be <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=316.067s">need</a> a ray of hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=317.588s">So</a> the ray of hope is that already in some countries they have flattened the curve and so it's really a question of right now doing everything we can to reduce the number of people who get it at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=334.901s">But</a> you know there was a great video of a doctor talking about what's happening in Taiwan and in Taiwan you know they are <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=345.771s">they</a> are currently kind of going about their daily lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=348.493s">They</a> have tons of tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=350.594s">They</a> have testing for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=352.875s">They</a> have plenty of masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=354.536s">Everyone</a> wears masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=356.477s">As</a> you enter public places like schools or shopping malls, they have little people who have like a little forehead temperature check <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=363.58s">And</a> then if you are quarantined, the government actually calls you at national health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=369.943s">So</a> the national health care system calls you three times a day to ask you about your symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=374.105s">And</a> if you need to go to the hospital, they arrange to have you delivered to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=378.827s">And</a> they pay people to stay home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=381.768s">So,</a> you know, there's a lot of hope there that we are not going to have to live like this forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=387.11s">And</a> if we can just, you know, be good for the next few weeks, we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=395.553s">Every</a> country is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=396.753s">Every</a> region is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=397.553s">But</a> hopefully we can get it under control and have some hope for more normal lives soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=410.852s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=411.793s">So</a> now I want to ask more questions about Mutually Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=417.757s">It's</a> so exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=418.817s">I</a> know you guys have, you have a lot of email lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=422.28s">Can</a> you just talk about sort of what you have available to people and how people are communicating through Mamas?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=531.625s">Yeah,</a> that's awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=534.626s">So</a> I know that we don't wanna, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=539.54s">give</a> it any personal information, but what are the needs that you're hearing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=545.302s">I'm</a> assuming, like, there are people who've lost their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=550.265s">There</a> are people, there are, you know, college students who have been kicked out of the dorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=556.947s">So</a> tell me what are some of the things that you're hearing from people in their needs?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=677.041s">Yeah,</a> definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=679.982s">I</a> want to go ahead and take this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=681.642s">There</a> was someone who posted a need, and for the show we kind of reached out to a few people, and she said she's very happy to have her email that she had sent read on the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=693.745s">So</a> I'm just going to read the very opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=696.446s">My</a> name is... <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=699.627s">So</a> my name is Ivy Ryan and I am a Somerville based actor and teaching artist and I just lost three quarters of my income and I'm scrambling to make it through March and April. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=712.796s">So</a> I think there are all sorts of needs that people are posting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=720.279s">It's</a> really amazing to sort of see what you're talking about, that there are people posting what's going on in their lives, and then there are all sorts of people who are offering to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=731.464s">And</a> I think it's very exciting and really what every community needs, what our community needs, what every community needs.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=799.006s">Absolutely,</a> you know, so thanks for that great segue because I was gonna, I was gonna run by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=804.848s">So</a> Ben, you and Kemp and City Councilor was going to be here tonight and then you know how everything is changing like every five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=811.151s">I</a> feel like in the last week we've been through like a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=815.113s">Things</a> are changing so quickly every day, so he's not able to make it tonight, but he sent over some of the things that he and J.T. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=824.258s">Scott,</a> two Somerville City Councilors, have requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=828.44s">They</a> did a resolution for things that they say the state and national government should do, and I'll just read a few of these off, and I'd love to get your sense about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=838.286s">For</a> workers in small business, including universal paid family and medical leave for all, unexpanded unemployment insurance for all workers, including self-employed, hourly, and gig workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=852.041s">Financial</a> assistance, including regular direct cash payments to all people without means testing for the duration of the crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=858.835s">a</a> public ownership stake of any large corporation receiving a federal bailout, and a prohibition on stock buybacks for any large corporation receiving a bailout. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=869.792s">And</a> I know stock buybacks are this thing that's confusing, not a lot of people understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=875.674s">They</a> were illegal until 1982. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=878.155s">So</a> it is very recently that corporations have been allowed to sort of buy up all of their own stock, which increases the price of their stock, which makes all their shareholders richer, and does nothing for the company except put it in deeper debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=890.379s">So</a> any thoughts on those before I go on to the next two? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=895.957s">Keep</a> going. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=896.498s">Keep</a> going. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=898.761s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=900.223s">Voting</a> rights, including immediate implementation of vote-by-mail policies in all states and territories in order to assure that our democracy functions during this crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=912.604s">And</a> the fourth one is incarcerated people, including taking all steps to avoid COVID-19 infection among incarcerated people, such as releasing all people currently held in pretrial detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=925.871s">A</a> lot of those are people who just don't have the money to pay for cash bail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=930.073s">So</a> sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=933.274s">Prohibition</a> on detaining people for greater than 48 hours without a court order. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=940.528s">without</a> a court order finding a threat to public safety, and immediate clemency and release granted for incarcerated people who do not pose a threat to public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=949.642s">Your</a> thoughts?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=992.22s">Yeah,</a> totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=993.761s">I</a> will say, I think we're going to have a criminal justice person on next week to talk about what's happening inside of jails where, you know, there literally isn't soap. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1005.648s">It's</a> like people are forced to like eat at the same table. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1008.87s">I</a> mean, it's just... <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1011.051s">terrifying,</a> terrifying.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1018.743s">Exactly,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1019.965s">And</a> the number of people who are in jail for like marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1024.467s">a</a> lot of crimes, which is not a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1026.31s">It's</a> like so crazy, so crazy.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1033.099s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1034.24s">Any</a> final words before we go on to invite our local doctor in to chat with us?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1080.597s">Thanks,</a> Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1081.257s">Thank</a> you so much for all the incredible, incredible work that you guys have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1085.319s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1088.159s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1088.46s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1089.14s">We'll</a> see you soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1093.344s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1099.129s">So</a> I am now going to invite in a doctor whose name is Mvanwi Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1104.134s">And</a> yes, it is not an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1105.936s">She</a> is my sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1108.238s">And</a> here she is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1111.281s">Let</a> me switch over the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1112.802s">It's</a> the first time I've done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1114.684s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1117.146s">Mvanwi,</a> hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1119.511s">Hi</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1120.091s">I</a> appear to, unfortunately, you are frozen at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1123.594s">Let</a> me just see if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1126.596s">You're</a> frozen in Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1128.137s">Oh,</a> dear. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1128.718s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1131.76s">We've</a> got your photo, but we cannot see you in Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1135.722s">So</a> let me, do you mind if I just call you back? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1139.485s">That's</a> absolutely fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1140.546s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1141.146s">I'll</a> be right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1141.807s">Let</a> me do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1144.188s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1146.05s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1146.49s">I</a> have lost both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1148.151s">I'm</a> going to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1149.906s">A</a> quick dial in.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1305.937s">Can</a> you give an example of a recommendation that was yesterday or the other day?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1428.762s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1429.863s">And</a> if we only had the testing, then people could get tested and they wouldn't have to.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1472.436s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1477.257s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about other ways that clinics that are still open are protecting both the clinicians and the patients?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1576.179s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1577.159s">And</a> so one thing I also wanted to ask you about, just because I know we've talked about a little bit, is there's some sort of rotation schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1585.822s">So</a> there's specific places where the COVID patients are being sent, and other places where they're not coming in, and then there's a rotation schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1593.705s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1627.279s">Yeah,</a> and is there a rotation of
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1690.604s">It's</a> really incredible the sort of organization that is happening between these different hospitals and different, you know, different sort of corporate entities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1700.949s">So</a> there's, you know, various different organizations that own different clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1705.712s">And</a> so it's really amazing to see that all this coordination happening.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1757.186s">And</a> the idea of flattening the curve is that the action you take today will flatten the curve 10 days from now? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1764.65s">Something</a> like that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1806.045s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1806.545s">And</a> you were mentioning earlier today, I think that we have more hospitals and medical clinics per person than most places or? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1816.808s">Than</a> most places.

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1897.79s">And</a> the good thing about washing your hands is like the virus itself is encased in like a lipid. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1902.194s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1903.835s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1904.296s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1985.412s">I've</a> been in the education field for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1987.833s">Oh,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1989.453s">You</a> can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1992.795s">So</a> I really have two questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=1996.176s">The</a> first one is what it's like to be a teacher during the whole coronavirus craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2000.717s">And</a> then the second one is going to be about the paras and the current contract fight that you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2005.319s">But</a> if you could talk first about what is it like? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2008.74s">You're</a> a teacher, and then all the schools are closed.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2181.816s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2182.537s">And</a> what is your, is, are you, so are you doing things during the day through the public school system that they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2190.3s">Are</a> you doing training? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2190.98s">Are</a> you doing, you know, are you interacting within Zoom calls with the kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2195.022s">Like</a> what's, what's, what's happening day to day?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2276.652s">Yeah,</a> we have a comment from one of the viewers that says, thanks, Daphne. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2281.455s">And</a> the Welcome Project is offering translation services for free to help communicate resources, et cetera.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2300.741s">Good,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2302.361s">Yeah,</a> so I would love to hear from you a little bit more about the paras. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2308.863s">I</a> know you guys are in a contract fight with the city of Somerville for a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2314.304s">And</a> if you can give us a brief sort of rundown of what it is and then sort of what's the state of it now.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2341.348s">Yeah,</a> that's so insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2343.369s">Sorry,</a> that's like so horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2345.45s">It's</a> like I can't even believe it.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2546.358s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2547.799s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2548.499s">It's</a> good to have the update on what's going on with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2553.002s">Oh,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2555.583s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2556.123s">There's</a> lots and lots of us who are on your side. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2560.245s">We</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2562.587s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2563.447s">So</a> yeah, great to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2565.949s">Do</a> you have any final thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2566.97s">By</a> the way, if anybody has questions, we can always throw your questions up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2570.113s">You</a> can just put them in the comments in the YouTube comments section. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2576.358s">So</a> yeah, if you have any final thoughts you want to about just about how can we weather this? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2583.945s">How</a> can parents <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2585.326s">get</a> through this time without child care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2588.787s">How</a> do we do that?
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2697.844s">And</a> by the way, being outdoors, A-OK, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2700.766s">A-OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2701.846s">A-OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2704.228s">This</a> whole stay at home thing doesn't mean you can't go for a walk, go for a bike ride, go to a park, and stay six feet away from the other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2710.992s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2717.456s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2718.325s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2720.006s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2720.487s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2722.148s">Lovely</a> to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2723.129s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2724.09s">Thank</a> you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2724.99s">Good</a> to see you too. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2725.851s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2726.532s">And</a> we'll keep in touch and we'll keep people updated on how the Paris fight is going as well.
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2739.682s">And</a> so that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2741.744s">We're</a> going to go ahead and I will close up just with a reiteration that <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2747.559s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2748.699s">Oh,</a> I have a lot of comments coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2752.681s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2753.141s">This</a> is funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2760.503s">Living</a> in a roommate situation can be tricky in easy times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2763.404s">How</a> do you convince roommates who won't agree to stop having guests over to agree? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2769.946s">Is</a> having one guest in your personal quarters over okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2775.665s">Wow,</a> that's a very interesting question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2780.167s">Who</a> knows who is the best person to answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2782.668s">I</a> have lived with roommates for pretty much my entire adult life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2785.869s">I</a> live in co-ops and my family now lives in co-op and we love our housemates. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2791.791s">But</a> we all sat down and we had the conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2797.048s">Who</a> is going to be invited over? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2798.63s">Who</a> is not going to be invited over? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2801.213s">Where</a> is it okay for us to go out of the house? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2808.131s">real</a> conversations about the sort of danger, the actual danger of what it could be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2815.716s">And</a> not, like I know a lot of people, because it's more dangerous for people who are older, maybe younger folks are thinking like, oh well, even if I get it, it's like a flu, it's not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2826.063s">Like</a> even if you are okay, and even if it is like a regular flu for you, or even if you do not show symptoms, <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2834.768s">So</a> the reason this thing, you know, my sister who was just on was saying that there were 700 and something cases yesterday in Massachusetts and like 1,700 cases today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2846.318s">So</a> more than doubled the number of cases that we saw come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2851.081s">That's</a> because you transmit the disease to anyone that you interact with before you even have any symptoms at all, before you know that you have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2859.688s">For</a> other people, it is really important that you guys have that conversation and talk about like, hey, you know, who is going to come over? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2870.94s">And</a> where are those people going? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2873.202s">And</a> what are those people doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2874.003s">And</a> washing your hands and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2878.626s">I</a> do feel for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2881.948s">Having</a> roommates can be a big blessing, makes you less lonely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2885.99s">But</a> it also, you know, these things to discuss and agree upon are pretty important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2890.833s">So</a> good luck with that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2894.074s">And</a> oh, and we have a comment from someone saying, I would have a conversation with your roommates about not having guests over. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2903.358s">The</a> more closed loop, you could have the better chance of not spreading, less interaction, less spreading. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2909.801s">So</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2912.722s">And</a> then finally, I will put, I don't know how to do it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2917.244s">I'm</a> still new to this thing of broadcasting at the same time as having other people, other speakers on, so using some new software. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2926.427s">But</a> I'm going to put some links to the Tomas Pueyo articles, the Medium articles, <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2936.06s">about</a> why you must act now, so the importance that might be helpful with the roommate discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2941.882s">And</a> then the hammer and the dance, which is a lovely, a really good article that gives you hope that we're not going to be here social distancing forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2949.603s">I</a> also have someone commenting, saying that if it's multiple roommates and having a group conversation and getting everyone on the same page is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2960.526s">And</a> I totally agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2963.217s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2964.418s">It</a> has been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2966.08s">I</a> want to say one of the big goals of doing this, we're going to try and do it every week with different folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2970.945s">We</a> have city councilors from several and Medford that we'll have on the show, and lots of other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2976.23s">And</a> one of the big goals is to hear stories of what's happening in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2983.698s">and</a> to have others in our community be aware of what's happening to the sort of more vulnerable people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2989.9s">So</a> we know that there are folks here who have lost their housing because they were at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=2993.821s">We</a> know there are folks here who have lost their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3000.262s">And</a> so finding ways that we can support each other is what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3006.564s">Thank</a> you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3007.385s">We're</a> going to sign off for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3009.748s">You</a> can always go to AnnaCallahan.com slash getupdates to sign up there to make sure that you hear about future shows that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3018.58s">We'll</a> try and have them once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3019.902s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3020.563s">Bye</a> bye. <a href="https://youtu.be/GgIhz_QS2tk&t=3021.143s">Stay</a> safe.<h2><a href="../2024-10-15_-E-nNnYy-GU/2024-10-15_-E-nNnYy-GU.html">Why you should vote yes on 6, 7, and 8</a></h2>
 <p>[Anna Callahan]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=2.271s">Hi</a> there is Anna Callahan, I'm one of your city Councilors and today I want to talk a little bit about why we have these prop two and a half overrides on the ballot in November and why you should vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=13.52s">So</a> a lot of people may feel that they already pay a lot in taxes, and they want to know where that money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=20.967s">I</a> think that is a fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=22.308s">I</a> think, first, it's important to understand that it costs money to run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=28.493s">So</a> the question is, are we spending just as much as other cities but getting less in services? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=34.779s">Are</a> we spending more money than other cities and somehow wasting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=38.566s">Are</a> we spending less money and not able to meet our expenses? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=45.61s">So</a> in fiscal year 2024, Medford ranks 320th out of 351 municipalities in our operating budget per capita. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=59.306s">Of</a> all of the other 58 cities in Massachusetts, Medford spends less per person than every single one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=67.551s">Our</a> budget is smaller per person than every other city in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=73.113s">Our</a> budget is also smaller than 90% of all towns in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=78.676s">90%</a> of towns spend more per person than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=81.378s">They</a> have a larger budget than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=83.859s">The</a> few that spend less than we do are much smaller than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=88.013s">So</a> we really do not have a budget that is large enough to properly fund our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=97.116s">Our</a> budget is too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=99.877s">I</a> wanna get into a little bit of a detailed discussion of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=105.799s">And</a> this idea, I've heard a lot of people talk about the idea that we should be able to like scrimp and save our way out of this budget crisis, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=116.224s">So</a> let's go ahead and show you a graph that I made. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=121.112s">So</a> this is our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=124.137s">And</a> I want you to just look at the largest expense we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=127.482s">This</a> is our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=129.595s">And</a> I think everyone agrees, no matter what side of this issue of the Prop 2.5 issue you're on, everyone agrees that we need to fund our schools and properly fund them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=140.46s">There</a> was a crisis this year that we did not have enough in the operating budget to properly fund the schools now that the ARPA funds, the city, or sorry, the federal funds that were there for COVID, now that those funds have ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=155.988s">So</a> we were looking for how to find at least three million, maybe five million more dollars to fund the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=161.136s">So</a> we're not taking money out of the school budget, that's for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=166.07s">The</a> second largest one is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=168.692s">Now,</a> insurance is required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=171.975s">Unfortunately,</a> it goes up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=175.218s">It's</a> not something that stays fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=176.76s">It's</a> something that goes up, it increases every year just due to normal inflation and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=185.107s">And</a> it's uncontrollable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=186.208s">There's</a> nothing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=186.949s">We</a> cannot cut out of the insurance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=189.05s">This</a> next one is pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=191.15s">Now,</a> pensions, our contracts, we are required to fulfill by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=196.111s">They</a> also are not staying the same or going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=198.931s">There</a> is an uncontrollable expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=200.872s">We</a> cannot take money out of the pensions budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=204.952s">Next</a> is the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=207.473s">And</a> after that is the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=210.093s">I</a> suspect that no one, no matter what side of the prop two and a half override question you are on, wants us to drastically cut our police and fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=221.428s">After</a> police and fire, the next one is highway, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=226.371s">That's</a> DBW highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=227.212s">That</a> means our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=229.053s">And</a> I do want to get a little bit into roads because I think talking about roads can help people understand why we are in the situation that we are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=238.42s">We</a> had a roads assessment done for the first time in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=244.385s">And</a> that assessment rated our roads one, two, three, four, and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=249.069s">And</a> with one being the best and five being the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=251.692s">A</a> full 49% of our roads rated four or five. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=259.973s">They're</a> the worst two categories of roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=262.254s">Now,</a> you can tell, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=263.374s">You</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=264.334s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=265.074s">We</a> drive on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=265.995s">I</a> bike on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=267.355s">We</a> walked on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=268.836s">And</a> we can all basically, we didn't need an assessment to tell us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=273.517s">But</a> what the assessment can tell us is that it costs between 30 and 50 times as much to repair a category 5 road as it does to repair a category 2 road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=284.66s">Now,</a> if we just always fixed the Category 2 roads to Category 1 roads, if we just always fixed our roads every year, the state Chapter 90 funding, it would cover everything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=297.124s">But</a> when you allow your roads to fall into such disrepair, <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=302.336s">You</a> balloon this road debt, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=304.877s">You</a> balloon the amount of money that's called a backlog, the amount of money it will take to repair your roads, because it costs so much more to repair dilapidated roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=315.362s">It's</a> as if you have a house, and you allow a leak in your roof to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=321.445s">You</a> don't fix it, and you keep letting it get worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=324.426s">That's</a> going to destroy your ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=325.586s">It's</a> going to destroy your hardwood floors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=326.867s">It's</a> going to destroy the ceiling on the next floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=329.168s">It</a> costs more and more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=331.269s">by</a> not repairing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=333.134s">Now,</a> we have underfunded our city for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=337.908s">that</a> we are ballooning these kinds of debt, the amount of capital projects, buildings, fire trucks that need to be replaced, that are long overdue for being replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=351.317s">We</a> have many tens of millions of dollars, $67 million in road debt and many tens of millions of dollars in capital improvement debt because we have underfunded our city, chronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=367.004s">So</a> going back to this, this is roads right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=374.748s">And</a> we do not want to underfund our roads because it just makes the problem so much worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=380.591s">After</a> roads is bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=383.573s">That</a> is debt that we must repay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=386.954s">And</a> again, we can't cut that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=389.576s">It</a> continues to increase, like not increase, but it continues to be something that we have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=396.44s">And</a> then you get to the library facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=399.502s">And</a> there are other much, much, much smaller amounts in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=404.986s">But</a> none of these are going to cover the $3 million that we need to give to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=412.691s">So</a> there is literally nowhere, unless you're willing to cut police and fire, there is nowhere to scrimp and save and find the money that we need to fund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=424.882s">The</a> only way that we are going to get a budget that appropriately funds our schools and our roads is by doing what almost every other city and town in Massachusetts has done, which is to pass a Prop 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=439.369s">And</a> I will also say that the proponents of Prop 2.5 in 1980, they didn't pass it to make it wrong or bad or illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=448.233s">to</a> increase taxes more than two and a half, not increase taxes by two and a half percent, but to increase the total amount, the total tax levy, the total amount of taxes that a city brings in more than two and a half percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=459.036s">They</a> wanted cities to put them on the ballot so that when it was necessary and appropriate, those taxes would in fact go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=468.898s">So</a> I hope that this has been informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=471.319s">I</a> look forward to any kinds of questions that you have and do reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=477.461s">And</a> I hope that everyone will vote yes on six, seven, and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-E-nNnYy-GU&t=480.943s">Thank</a> you.
