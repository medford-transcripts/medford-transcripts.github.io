    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3252.397s">[Callahan]</a>: On Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3257.545s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just want to make sure that we're not sending stuff to legal that we don't need to send to legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3262.186s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding from the building commissioner is that on that we are the appropriate body to make appeals and final decisions when it has already gone through the building department on things like signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3277.85s">[Callahan]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3280.331s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not positive it doesn't need to go to legal, but I think we should not just send everything to legal just to send things to legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8317.903s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8319.925s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I think the most frightening thing to me is that it is very clear that people are being snatched off the street with absolutely no due process at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8334.295s">[Callahan]</a>: So this question of someone who it has now come out is really innocent of anything, even being in this country illegally, who has been deported not to his home country, but to a prison in El Salvador that is renowned around the world for torture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8352.068s">[Callahan]</a>: And this person is not being recalled, even though it has now been made clear that they were not who the government thought that they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8360.897s">[Callahan]</a>: Seeing Rumesa snatched off the street in that video was genuinely, should be frightening for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8373.546s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think we should remember the famous poem from Nazi Germany that says, first they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8383.432s">[Callahan]</a>: Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8387.894s">[Callahan]</a>: Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8391.896s">[Callahan]</a>: And then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8396.858s">[Callahan]</a>: So anyone who feels safe should really just pause and think about what it means for people to be snatched off the street by people who do not have a warrant and are not declaring who they are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8413.196s">[Callahan]</a>: with absolutely no due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8415.699s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that that does not end well for anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8419.304s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone here could be mistaken for someone else and shipped off to a gulag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8428.115s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am very happy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8431.125s">[Callahan]</a>: to be on a city council that is doing everything that we can in this moment to try to protect our residents who are being targeted for a variety of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8442.833s">[Callahan]</a>: But really, that ends with anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8446.556s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10952.642s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10954.204s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize for not being there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10955.645s">[Callahan]</a>: I am sick and I did not want to get anyone all sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10960.392s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to encourage anyone who was not at our last meeting to read my blog post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10965.637s">[Callahan]</a>: I have been interested in the nitty-gritty details of how democracies work, including different voting systems and wards versus districts versus at large and all that stuff for a long, long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10982.913s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you want to know my full thoughts, that's on my blog at annakalahan.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10988.114s">[Callahan]</a>: The short story is that both nationally and internationally, people who study democracy and democratic systems all are pretty much in consensus that single seat first past the post districts, which is what ward or district seats are, are known to be one of the worst at appropriately representing people's political views.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11011.248s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, I want to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11014.509s">[Callahan]</a>: So I mean, I've been for 30 years, probably a person who believes that we that, you know, we're in a hybrid system, but one that is balanced, right, that does not have too many water district seats, and does not have too many at large seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11033.649s">[Callahan]</a>: I know the Charter Study Committee did do a survey, and a lot of people are talking about, you know, what came out of the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11038.99s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to remind us that there were 663 responses to that survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11044.812s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, I really am happy that they did a survey, and I know how hard they worked to get those responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11055.658s">[Callahan]</a>: I will also comment that there never was a question asking how large the wards or district should be, whether we should have districts the same size as Somerville, which would be 4 or wards, which would be 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11068.124s">[Callahan]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11070.785s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm unconvinced that the community, from that particular survey that we can read out of that survey, that what everybody who answered those questions is that they wanted to have eight wards rather than districts the same size as other cities near us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11087.189s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say one thing that we do know is that Medford voted strongly in favor of ranked choice voting in a statewide vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11094.91s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that over 10,000 people voted in that election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11098.955s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we want to know what Medford actually thinks with confidence, we know that Medford wants rank-choice voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11106.477s">[Callahan]</a>: And my concern is that by passing this, we are locking ourselves into a charter that won't allow us to have rank-choice voting for these single-seat first-past-the-post districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11120.04s">[Callahan]</a>: So whether it's wards or districts, we will not be able to have rank-choice voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11124.941s">[Callahan]</a>: If we had rank-choice voting, I would be happy to have eight and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11130.063s">[Callahan]</a>: But the more districts that you have compared to at large, right, the greater percentage of awards you have, the more it is a problem when you have this first-past-the-post single-seat district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11139.591s">[Callahan]</a>: And when I say locking in, my understanding is, and I really hope that we can get a definitive answer to this, that if we pass this charter, that we will not be able to get a home rule charter for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11152.444s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would like two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11155.166s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like, number one, if anyone among the city council can answer the question of who do we need to ask to get a definitive answer about whether passing this charter is locking us out of having a rank choice voting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11174.284s">[Callahan]</a>: a home rule charter that allows for ranked choice voting within the next 10, 20, 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11181.49s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to know who we can ask to definitively answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11185.994s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I would consider all of these amendments and things as long as we have one more week to work on this, as Vice President Collins suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11196.885s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11365.862s">[Callahan]</a>: No, I believe Anthony Wilson did answer my question, but I am interested in the answer, excuse me, to that question as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11371.448s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11934.278s">[Callahan]</a>: I can't hear Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11975.116s">[Callahan]</a>: Anna, can I jump in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11981.782s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, yes, I, I would much prefer, like, I know we haven't yet voted on whether to move this to the city to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11990.309s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, but I would much prefer not to vote on this, that particular motion tonight, but to vote on that at the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12004.442s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I amend can I, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12008.183s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if I can amend Councilor Leming's motion to ask that that be voted on next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12162.703s">[Callahan]</a>: I think I might have, I might have misunderstood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12165.925s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that I was asking Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12169.047s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that we were voting on the removing the mayor from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12173.79s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we were, I thought that was from Lemings and that was the one that I was hoping to move to next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12180.155s">[Callahan]</a>: So I didn't quite understand why you were asking Councilor or Vice President Collins to amend her motion to move to next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12186.919s">[Callahan]</a>: So maybe I misunderstood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12197.736s">[Callahan]</a>: Ah, I did not realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12771.125s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm so sorry, my internet has been in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12773.986s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you, I completely missed the one that we're voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12776.647s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you tell me again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=677.673s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2056.557s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you and I apologize person and don't want anybody else to get what I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2061.262s">[Callahan]</a>: So just a cold, but my question is about whether there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2066.848s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh, is any agreement with the company that provides this information or provides this technology, um, in the contract or, uh, with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2078.941s">[Callahan]</a>: Any partner of theirs, any 3rd party that any information from that is captured by Medford cameras would go to anyone aside from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2151.273s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, and to follow that up with, so it sounds like SenseN and GTEC, if I've got those correct, at some point, each of them has the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2160.919s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you know if SenseN deletes the data once it is transferred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2163.621s">[Callahan]</a>: And do you know if GTEC has any access to the data?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4721.569s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1686.482s">[Callahan]</a>: I concur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1687.342s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think we have to worry too much about consistency between them with something with a change as small as this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1798.211s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1799.752s">[Callahan]</a>: That was like the one that we pulled in from Unfinished Business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2232.109s">[Callahan]</a>: Just one quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2236.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2238.095s">[Callahan]</a>: Sometimes we say the council or council and sometimes we say we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2240.897s">[Callahan]</a>: That's probably fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2247.043s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2247.423s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you look under March 25th, we say council submitted, and later we say the council received, and then later we say we approved and we passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2255.686s">[Callahan]</a>: Should we make it a little bit more consistent and either say the council or we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2281.686s">[Callahan]</a>: I am happy either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2283.167s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I'd ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2332.034s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2333.274s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3338.052s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3339.613s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am going to make a suggestion, which is that we use this not only as an opportunity to get feedback, but as an opportunity to educate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3351.16s">[Callahan]</a>: I found that at one point during<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3356.232s">[Callahan]</a>: the fall, it was incredibly educational for the people that I talked to, to actually see a pie graph of our budget and to understand which of the elements in that pie graph are things that are discretionary and which are things that we cannot change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3369.198s">[Callahan]</a>: And in fact, sometimes like insurance, which is our second budget item, our first is our school district and our second at 15% is insurance, that insurance in fact goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3381.219s">[Callahan]</a>: We can't even keep it at 15% because it goes up by 10% this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3386.264s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would love it if we could include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3390.47s">[Callahan]</a>: a little bit of education along with this and just have like a pie chart that shows our current budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3398.412s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe we can, I think this is the 2024, which is, you know, or 2020, whatever the fiscal year starts in, in, in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3407.154s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I forget, is it the 2025 one, whichever is the current one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3410.755s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3413.792s">[Callahan]</a>: I have one that's colored, but I think what I would want to do is gray out the sections that are not discretionary, just to educate people on what parts of the budget do we actually have any ability to increase or decrease on our own, so that people have some idea of like what our budget actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3433.685s">[Callahan]</a>: Once people see it, I think they often are like, oh, wow, like I had no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3439.433s">[Callahan]</a>: And they stop arguing about things like, you know, all the stuff in there that's like 0.5% of the budget, you know, they're less concerned with how much it costs to do these, you know, incredibly small departments that are very mighty in their ability to help our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3564.376s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3565.097s">[Callahan]</a>: By the way, the Zoom is not responding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3566.578s">[Callahan]</a>: It's covering the whole screen here just so you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3570.34s">[Callahan]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3570.82s">[Callahan]</a>: Zoom is not responding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3571.54s">[Callahan]</a>: It's covering the whole screen so no one can see your screen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3576.964s">[Callahan]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3577.564s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sitting at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3802.988s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just have a question I'm excited to bring up in a public meeting so I can ask my fellow Councilors if anyone wants to work with me on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3811.532s">[Callahan]</a>: Many years ago when I was the president of the board of a 432 person housing association, I did a participatory budgeting measure where I actually invited everyone who lived there to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3833.083s">[Callahan]</a>: basically put in like they got to see the exact budget and they, you know, got to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3840.844s">[Callahan]</a>: make their own adjustments to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3843.845s">[Callahan]</a>: And it was advisory, but it got a lot of interest and it was very educational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3850.829s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wonder if any of my fellow city councilors would be interested in working with me to put together something similar that would allow our residents to really kind of dig into the budget and make their own recommendations as an advisory to our budgetary process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3885.739s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to have a co sponsor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3887.18s">[Callahan]</a>: So if there's one person that can work with me on it I can kind of put it together and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3897.381s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, exactly, like, put together, just somebody that we can put together a motion and then we can chit-chat about, like, how to put together the first draft so that when it comes to committee, we'll be able to... I'm personally happy to step in for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3929.987s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, we're three members of the committee right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3931.789s">[Callahan]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3932.87s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm just looking for somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3934.391s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to know who it is that I can work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3936.293s">[Callahan]</a>: I think having one other co-sponsor and not two because we're all on this committee and it's going to come to this committee I think is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4256.777s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I would just add that the specifics of our city and the fact that we have, we don't have that many like giant apartment buildings, but we have a lot of like duplexes where one or both of those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4273.232s">[Callahan]</a>: are rented out, it is super hard to reach those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4277.176s">[Callahan]</a>: You just can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4278.137s">[Callahan]</a>: It's very, very, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4322.398s">[Callahan]</a>: That one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4549.33s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4550.25s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'll provide, I'll bring my pie chart and I'll gray out the ones that are not, you know, actionable, not discretionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4558.075s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, and we can vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4559.756s">[Callahan]</a>: We like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4560.136s">[Callahan]</a>: I should change colors and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4855.329s">[Callahan]</a>: To schedule our next meeting, this committee's next meeting for two weeks from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2100.665s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2100.885s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2102.426s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, it actually looks like there aren't very many changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2105.687s">[Callahan]</a>: A lot of these are simply a comment saying that it is consistent with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2110.569s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is, you know, 1234567 just on the first page and almost all of the comments on the first page as well as in one of the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2120.372s">[Callahan]</a>: I might be wrong about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2122.233s">[Callahan]</a>: But many of these what look like changes aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2125.314s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wonder, could we go over just the substantive changes first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2130.037s">[Callahan]</a>: Would that be okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3162.8s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3164.041s">[Callahan]</a>: You notice one thing as I'm looking, so just below that, after D before E, all city agents shall comply with any state regulation pertaining to reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare, not otherwise explicitly stated in this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3179.07s">[Callahan]</a>: And the change is all city employees and officials shall comply with any state or federal law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3187.803s">[Callahan]</a>: Clearly, we understand the current state of federal actors and potential for federal law changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3201.245s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wonder, was that state regulation very specific to not include federal regulation when it was originally written?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3208.311s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that something that we specifically want to keep and perhaps leave out federal law silently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3215.877s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I don't think that's going to get us in any trouble just to not include the words or federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3890.605s">[Callahan]</a>: I have something small, and I'm mostly just asking if this language means what I think it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3898.76s">[Callahan]</a>: under the role of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3905.584s">[Callahan]</a>: So the language changed from the police department of the city of Medford shall not to blah, blah, blah, no officer or employee of a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3919.712s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3920.697s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not a lawyer, I'm more of a layperson in terms of legalese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3924.38s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, a law enforcement agent of the Commonwealth is a state police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3929.905s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think what we're trying to say is the Medford Police Department, and the new language does not say that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3988.803s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, why are we writing language for any random city in the Commonwealth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3993.226s">[Callahan]</a>: Like we're Medford, we should only be talking about Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4171.217s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4173.217s">[Callahan]</a>: So my only thing about that is, I think in the city agent definition, it's kind of a little bit more encompassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4179.639s">[Callahan]</a>: It says employee of the city, whether full-time or part-time, regular or seasonal, any intern or volunteer when acting on behalf of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4187.681s">[Callahan]</a>: And I kind of like that definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4189.441s">[Callahan]</a>: And I feel like it's a little bit more encompassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4191.101s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there a reason to not go with that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4193.562s">[Callahan]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4210.052s">[Callahan]</a>: But shorten that, shorten it to that, just the beginning part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4223.887s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I'm of two minds of the contractor part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4227.888s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we might need to check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4229.708s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know what we need to check, but I'm sure that first part, and I think we're all agreed that not the grants and the award, people who got an award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4239.49s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think we're just in the middle section of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2467.952s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2469.033s">[Callahan]</a>: I also support and I'm curious about the idea of having height next to 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2474.195s">[Callahan]</a>: So in that parcel furthest to the east.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2478.297s">[Callahan]</a>: So I mentioned the answer to that question from the planners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2482.399s">[Callahan]</a>: I also want us to look at the parcel furthest to or the parcels furthest to the west.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2487.782s">[Callahan]</a>: When I look at the other map that you provided a number of meetings ago that shows the actual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2494.605s">[Callahan]</a>: Current zoning or not zoning but current like existing buildings that is marked as orange, which says condo conversion two to three family so I'm not sure exactly what buildings exist there at this moment that did not seem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2511.562s">[Callahan]</a>: to go drive with my recollection of what buildings are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2514.484s">[Callahan]</a>: But like understanding what height is there right now would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2518.046s">[Callahan]</a>: It does, you know, that whole section abuts on multiple single family or like currently mostly single family places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2524.95s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm a little bit curious about can we get more height close to 93 and maybe get something on the other side that's a little bit closer to match the residences that are just to the west and north of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2879.201s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm looking at the planning and permitting agenda from the 12th of February, which is an amazing one because it included a lot of maps, and this is one of those maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2888.445s">[Callahan]</a>: It's just the one that shows like every parcel and what exists on that parcel, and it's marked as orange, which is condo conversion duty family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2896.969s">[Callahan]</a>: Not sure why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4044.937s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciated those look at the heights and the shadows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4050.063s">[Callahan]</a>: The one that I was curious about was the Salem Street one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4056.109s">[Callahan]</a>: It does appear that all of the others covered where the shadows would be on the north side for Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4066.681s">[Callahan]</a>: How does it work as we're looking north of Salem Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4071.084s">[Callahan]</a>: When we look at the housing that's north of Salem Street, and there's a road there, how does that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4079.269s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that wasn't covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4080.31s">[Callahan]</a>: Almost everything else, it covers what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4085.834s">[Callahan]</a>: But those buildings, which we're changing on the left side that you're circling right now, what about the housing that is on the other side of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4094.179s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I'm curious about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4149.065s">[Callahan]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4149.946s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4416.201s">[Callahan]</a>: I am just curious that the cemetery lot is zoned as mixed use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5239.735s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5240.215s">[Callahan]</a>: I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5241.836s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that when I looked at one of the Medford Square master plans, it talked about very, very specific types of businesses that we are lacking in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5257.782s">[Callahan]</a>: And I should look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5259.903s">[Callahan]</a>: and go back and recall more exactly which types of businesses those were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5264.365s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think it was things like more restaurants and less insurance companies or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5269.167s">[Callahan]</a>: Not that I want to pick on insurance companies or anything, but more of the places where people go and walk in and less of places where people don't actually have to walk into that store on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5283.753s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I'm curious if that is something that we do with zoning, or if that is something like, is there a micro zoning that you do in a place like Medford squared?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5291.858s">[Callahan]</a>: It took to sort of try to incentivize the kinds of businesses that we want that are to be in the center of the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5298.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Or is that something that we rely upon our generally our planning department and our economic development director and those sorts of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5307.388s">[Callahan]</a>: people if we want to change the percentage of those types of businesses that we have in the square to make it a more vibrant and walkable square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5722.245s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5722.725s">[Callahan]</a>: That's actually incredibly helpful to hear what other communities do and that there is this possibility of, you know, like a economic district supported by a group of, you know, public and private, I suppose, might be a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5738.9s">[Callahan]</a>: name for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5740.001s">[Callahan]</a>: That's great to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5741.121s">[Callahan]</a>: And thanks so much for elaborating on the usefulness of zoning in this particular thing and how we actually do it, which is not through zoning, but really through our staff and our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5751.748s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2758.883s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2759.123s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I'm gonna say something somewhat similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2762.207s">[Callahan]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2764.208s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not our specialty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2766.331s">[Callahan]</a>: We have a building department that it is their specialty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2769.916s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't quite understand why this has come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2775.202s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2777.247s">[Callahan]</a>: at a minimum, like, I don't know if this is the proper process that like, at some point, if we are the appeal authority, we are the final authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2786.57s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2787.951s">[Callahan]</a>: I think having, you know, the someone from the building department here would be incredibly helpful to understand the final issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2796.934s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I have not read any word in this large town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2801.015s">[Callahan]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2804.598s">[Callahan]</a>: On the face of it, I mean, you just want to change the sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2808.24s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems pretty reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2809.741s">[Callahan]</a>: But again, this is not our specialty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2812.403s">[Callahan]</a>: We are not the people who normally do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2815.065s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would at least want to have at least a little someone from the building department chime in to understand why have they not approved this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2823.291s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3185.679s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess my first question is, if this waits a week or two is that gonna be horrible like is there some is there some great urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3408.657s">[Callahan]</a>: for clarifying that we are in fact the appropriate body for this to come to after the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3412.72s">[Callahan]</a>: Given that, I would actually prefer rather than paying the, I don't think we need to pay a legal team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3417.604s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that we want to honestly hear from the building department and whether they show up here or whether, you know, at the thing so we can ask them questions or whether, you know, we can have an understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3427.953s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, I read it and it's like, they just want to change what's on the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3432.156s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, it seems like a no-brainer and I just want to understand from the building department, like, why is it that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3438.315s">[Callahan]</a>: They can't like I've read the legalese, but like I would love to have the building department chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6294.848s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6296.569s">[Callahan]</a>: I definitely agree in the need for us to support to find money to do these, the nexus study so that we can update the linkage fees especially for affordable housing which I think we should do first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6312.278s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm absolutely supportive of that, but I will not vote in favor of selling off public lands, which we'd never get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6320.119s">[Callahan]</a>: when we have $28 million sitting in free cash, let alone the money that is in stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6326.861s">[Callahan]</a>: I cannot understand why we are selling off public lands when we clearly have many times that amount of money in free cash that we do not know what that is planned to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6339.225s">[Callahan]</a>: So I will not vote to sell off public lands at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7046.443s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I completely agree that one-time expenses, just like this nexus fee, is exactly what Free Cash is designed for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7054.546s">[Callahan]</a>: It is what it should be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7056.347s">[Callahan]</a>: We have plenty of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7057.368s">[Callahan]</a>: We should be using free cash for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7058.948s">[Callahan]</a>: Once you sell public lands, it is gone forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7060.889s">[Callahan]</a>: I have yet to see that there has been any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7065.451s">[Callahan]</a>: that we're going to have to sort of brainstorming or real in depth study of what could be done with those parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7072.776s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh it isn't simply that there could be permanently affordable housing on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7076.618s">[Callahan]</a>: There are many other things that can be done with public lands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7079.28s">[Callahan]</a>: Um and II really urge my city Councilors to not rush through to sell public lands when it has not been thought through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7088.146s">[Callahan]</a>: And to urge the mayor to pay for the next study as soon as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1387.497s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1388.737s">[Callahan]</a>: So I do support many of the other items that other folks have brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1392.958s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just going to talk about the two that I put in that have been projects that I have been working on for quite a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1401.88s">[Callahan]</a>: So one of them is about the volunteer tree planting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1406.501s">[Callahan]</a>: I have been working with folks in Trees Medford and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1413.442s">[Callahan]</a>: talking to tons of volunteers about this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1416.283s">[Callahan]</a>: We did have the DPW commissioner come in to the committee to speak about what it would take to get this program off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1427.468s">[Callahan]</a>: And let me just say a little bit about why it's important that, you know, we do lose about twice as many trees as we plant every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1435.291s">[Callahan]</a>: And yes, we live, we, you know, a third of Medford is the fells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1437.872s">[Callahan]</a>: We have lots of trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1438.793s">[Callahan]</a>: I think if you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1439.653s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, live in the kind of northern part of Ward 6, you feel like there's lots and lots of trees, but if you live south of the river, you really, and especially if you've lived there for a long time, I talk to many people who say that they have lived on their street for decades, and it used to be a canopy of trees, and you look now, and it is barren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1464.349s">[Callahan]</a>: This depresses home prices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1466.411s">[Callahan]</a>: It causes us to have heat islands, makes people pay more for heating in the winter, for cooling in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1475.677s">[Callahan]</a>: There's so many reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1477.719s">[Callahan]</a>: It doesn't clean our air from pollution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1479.28s">[Callahan]</a>: There's so many reasons why we need to be replacing these trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1486.705s">[Callahan]</a>: Anecdotally, you can just see on my street, not that my street is any more important than anyone's street, but on my street, you can see these little squares where there used to be a tree planted in front of every house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1498.262s">[Callahan]</a>: And now, on the whole block, there is one remaining tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1502.813s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really believe that with our small budget in Medford, with our small budget and our mighty residents, mighty in their willingness to volunteer, I think that we can solve this problem with very little addition to the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1523.424s">[Callahan]</a>: And we can do it through activating our community and getting people involved in community events, meeting their neighbors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1530.388s">[Callahan]</a>: And the DPW commissioner said that all it would take would be one staffer, like a halftime staffer, who was a volunteer coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1540.936s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's my first request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1543.158s">[Callahan]</a>: My second request is a halftime person involved in housing to run a home sharing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1550.103s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, I've been meeting with our housing person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1553.746s">[Callahan]</a>: and other, you know, many other residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1557.429s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, we've been meeting for months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1559.632s">[Callahan]</a>: We have met with people who run the sort of national home sharing organization that helps people start home sharing programs in their cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1569.901s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll tell you a little bit about the idea behind home sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1573.865s">[Callahan]</a>: In our city, according to our senior center, I hope I am not incorrect if I'm not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1581.891s">[Callahan]</a>: What they said is that we have a larger percentage of seniors, people over 65 than we have ever had in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1590.877s">[Callahan]</a>: And the reality is that many of those people live in houses that have four or five bedrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1597.662s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1598.973s">[Callahan]</a>: As I have talked to seniors, both of the senior center, you know, as I was knocking on doors people that I, you know, interact with some of these folks that I've been meeting with many many seniors here in Medford would like to downsize or they are worried about aging in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1618.468s">[Callahan]</a>: but they either, the rent is getting hard to, sorry, they could use a little bit more financial security or they need a little help around the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1629.31s">[Callahan]</a>: We are not the only city facing this kind of issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1634.751s">[Callahan]</a>: It is really interlocked with our housing crisis because 50 years ago, we had 9,000 more people living in the city with less housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1643.172s">[Callahan]</a>: So our problem is that we have fewer people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1648.593s">[Callahan]</a>: per bedroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1649.894s">[Callahan]</a>: We have one person living in a three-, four-, five-bedroom house, and that isn't how it used to be, and that isn't how it could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1659.315s">[Callahan]</a>: So we can really help both our seniors to help them to age in place help them to be financially comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1666.399s">[Callahan]</a>: And we can also help our housing crisis by helping to solve this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1671.801s">[Callahan]</a>: And what a lot of other cities are doing is they're starting a home sharing program and it's a matchmaking service a very hand holding personalized matchmaking service that ensures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1681.866s">[Callahan]</a>: that older folks who have extra bedrooms can find a person who usually it's some mixture of financial payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1693.275s">[Callahan]</a>: They call them hosts and guests, kind of like Airbnb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1695.356s">[Callahan]</a>: It's a mixture of financial payment and service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1699.019s">[Callahan]</a>: So they can help take out the trash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1701.101s">[Callahan]</a>: They can help do a few things around the house for someone who is older and needs a little bit of help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1707.826s">[Callahan]</a>: I think this program could be really successful in Medford and it could solve a lot of our sort of interlocking problems that we have that are basically because of demographics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1719.411s">[Callahan]</a>: And so that's something that again, I think would be a very big impact for a very small amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1726.495s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3134.894s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3141.495s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess I'm, like, curious if we are suggesting increases in the budget in six places and don't cut the budget anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3149.619s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious, how do we, like, you know, how do we grok that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3155.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Because that doesn't add up to me unless there's, like, obviously the money from the Prop 2.5 is spoken for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3163.466s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3164.866s">[Callahan]</a>: So...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3167.972s">[Callahan]</a>: for level funding, everything, and then we're asking for increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3170.494s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, I'm trying to understand how we get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3346.133s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks Um, just a super quick<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3356.541s">[Callahan]</a>: actually make the decisions about reducing line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3360.023s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think that when we're like we we also can't tell the mayor what to add either, you know, and and so I think this is our opportunity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3373.471s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would just say that I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3376.981s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there is something to be said for us making those thoughts known in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3383.024s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't know, for folks who've been on this city council longer, if this forum is exactly the way to do that or if there are better ways to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3393.308s">[Callahan]</a>: But I do hope that keep everything the same and then add all of these other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3400.371s">[Callahan]</a>: I suspect that is less likely to get us any of those extra things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3407.014s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, this is our opportunity to make these kinds of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3410.836s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's, that's my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3412.477s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3482.358s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, just a super quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3483.539s">[Callahan]</a>: The next study is the linkage fees related one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3608.284s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to add my support for the solicitor, which is already on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3611.686s">[Callahan]</a>: And also this study for the linkage fees, even though it's one time, I would love to see it added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3615.688s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=4012.51s">[Callahan]</a>: I will happily third that with my support, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1897.24s">[Callahan]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1897.72s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just a little curious about the part that's near Magoon Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1903.663s">[Callahan]</a>: And mostly, I apologize, because I was looking for a previous map that you had that showed like the existing heights and structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1912.127s">[Callahan]</a>: And I apologize, I can't find that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1913.968s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm just curious for that urban residential to at the very bottom of the map is that one that's that's, you know, just just north of Bow Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1927.564s">[Callahan]</a>: The furthest south wine red urban residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1933.749s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1935.71s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, the furthest south wine red one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1938.932s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just slightly curious, like whether that is like existing buildings, like similar to existing buildings, or if this is like where we're going to hope for growth because it is close to T-stops down there and Boone Square and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2003.798s">[Callahan]</a>: No, I totally get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2005.239s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm actually just asking about the existing buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2035.426s">[Callahan]</a>: No, I think either way is great because it is close to some of these MTA stations that are not in Medford, but are clearly affecting, we should be building there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2046.268s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just a little bit curious, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2529.434s">[Callahan]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2533.133s">[Callahan]</a>: I know no one ever likes whatever colors you choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2539.018s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, but I do wonder if it would be possible to make the like mixed use and commercial, you know, somehow make them like the neighborhood residential being like yellow, green and red, like all possible primary colors like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2553.53s">[Callahan]</a>: is a little hard for me to tell where is residential versus where is, you know, there's possibility for commercial and I don't know if there's a way to make that slightly easier to grok.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2564.953s">[Callahan]</a>: I have to keep going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2566.653s">[Callahan]</a>: It just doesn't make sense in my brain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2569.634s">[Callahan]</a>: If it's not too much work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=238.528s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=239.569s">[Callahan]</a>: We had a really great meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=241.61s">[Callahan]</a>: We invited the parents of students with disabilities to come and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=246.572s">[Callahan]</a>: We discussed possibilities of how Medford can provide more activities for their children, covered many things between having it through the rec department and having it through more of a citywide effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=259.518s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that was the discussion and we're moving forward with trying to support those children here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15440.183s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15440.483s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to express how excited I am that we are including green score in our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15445.529s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's going to help us meet our climate goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15448.393s">[Callahan]</a>: I live relatively close to Vistacab and it is an absolute tree and greenness desert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15455.3s">[Callahan]</a>: It is an incredibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15457.703s">[Callahan]</a>: this incredible heat island and deeply unpleasant to walk by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15462.728s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that having this and especially the way that we have incorporated into Mystic Avenue and the way that we will be able to incorporate it into all of our zoning is just incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15475.061s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15476.142s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16613.404s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16613.724s">[Callahan]</a>: I have a very simple question, which is on this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16616.726s">[Callahan]</a>: It does say that the facilities assessment is being conducted by Habib Associates, who is an approved on-call house doctor for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16625.71s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just, I will say, found that a little bit confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16629.132s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have an on-call house doctor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16631.593s">[Callahan]</a>: which my understanding from the internet is an actual doctor, like who works for a hospital or an institution, which could be the city, and a doctor is conducting a facilities assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16641.142s">[Callahan]</a>: I just didn't seem to, I was wondering if there's a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17424.117s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not gonna speak on that motion, but I'll speak<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17428.439s">[Callahan]</a>: on the more general topic of the charter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17440.268s">[Callahan]</a>: It is late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17441.709s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize to my fellow city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17443.41s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm going to keep you up for another few minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17445.171s">[Callahan]</a>: I have been very interested in voting systems for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17448.454s">[Callahan]</a>: I studied the mathematics of voting systems while getting my undergraduate degree in math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17453.357s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I think I really want to take this opportunity since I haven't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17457.2s">[Callahan]</a>: previously spoken very much about the charter to talk about why I am in favor of the four districts and five at large system for the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17469.711s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you look at both national and international organizations that study voting systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17475.176s">[Callahan]</a>: It is well understood that multi seat systems are better than single seat systems and within single seat elections that first past the post is one of the worst possible electoral systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17485.947s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm going to catch people up on what these terms mean single seat versus multi seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17491.545s">[Callahan]</a>: So in a single-seat election, people in a localized geographic area, usually called a district or a ward, they only get to vote for one person, who usually is required to live in that ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17501.452s">[Callahan]</a>: And only one person represents those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17503.453s">[Callahan]</a>: So ward representation is single-seat representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17508.056s">[Callahan]</a>: In a multi-seat election, people in a geographic area, like a city or a state, get to vote for multiple people, and multiple people represent them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17516.261s">[Callahan]</a>: So at-large representation is multi-seat representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17521.265s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to talk about the terms proportional representation versus winner-take-all representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17528.491s">[Callahan]</a>: So first, all single-seat elections are by definition winner-take-all elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17532.695s">[Callahan]</a>: But multi-seat elections can be proportional, or they can be winner-take-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17537.519s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you think about how the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries work, and you may not know how they work, but I'm going to tell you how they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17545.845s">[Callahan]</a>: In the Democratic presidential primary, delegates in each state are allocated proportionally to the candidates based on the statewide vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17553.948s">[Callahan]</a>: So if a candidate wins 40% of the vote, that candidate gets 40% of the delegates from that state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17560.87s">[Callahan]</a>: It's proportional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17562.31s">[Callahan]</a>: In most states in the Republican primary, all of a state's delegates are allocated to the candidate who receives the majority of votes in that state's primary election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17573.213s">[Callahan]</a>: Or I think it's actually the plurality of votes in that state's election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17577.657s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you were to get 52% of the vote in that state, you would get 100% of the delegates from that state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17584.222s">[Callahan]</a>: That's called winner-take-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17586.564s">[Callahan]</a>: And the third set of terms I'm going to talk about are first-past-the-post, runoff elections, and rank-choice voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17594.53s">[Callahan]</a>: There are lots of different ways to run a single-seat election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17599.093s">[Callahan]</a>: But these three are the only ones that really we do in America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17601.815s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'll talk about those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17604.336s">[Callahan]</a>: In single seat elections in America, you most often see what's called first past the post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17609.399s">[Callahan]</a>: So everybody votes for one, whoever gets the most votes wins, even if you have five candidates and the highest vote getter only gets 25% of the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17618.424s">[Callahan]</a>: That means the 75% of people who voted for those other four candidates don't get their preferred choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17625.808s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, if you have a runoff election,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17627.767s">[Callahan]</a>: then, and you have five candidates running and one of them, the top voter gets only 25%, then there's a runoff later with the top two vote getters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17638.549s">[Callahan]</a>: And during that runoff, since there's only two, somebody is gonna get over 50% of the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17643.31s">[Callahan]</a>: Ranked choice voting is also called instant runoff voting because voters rank the candidates in their order of preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17651.051s">[Callahan]</a>: And essentially you're asking the voter to tell you their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17654.935s">[Callahan]</a>: took their vote and their runoff vote on the same ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17658.377s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's why it's called instant runoff voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17662.04s">[Callahan]</a>: And so what I'm going to talk about is how groups and researchers who study these different voting systems, what they see as outcomes for these different voting systems, or at least for the one considered to get the best representation and the one considered to get the worst representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17683.015s">[Callahan]</a>: Multi-seat proportional representation is associated with a greater likelihood that each constituent has at least one elected official who agrees with them on policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17692.782s">[Callahan]</a>: It is not possible to gerrymander in this system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17697.466s">[Callahan]</a>: Minority representation tends to improve under proportional multi-seat systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17704.891s">[Callahan]</a>: They tend to be more competitive with more seats in contention per district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17712.178s">[Callahan]</a>: They create space for more than two parties, and they lower polarization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17717.663s">[Callahan]</a>: They tend to have less extremism in the general population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17721.446s">[Callahan]</a>: And the elected officials in multi-seat proportional representation systems tend to be more likely to problem solve with people from other parties or platforms, and they tend to maintain democratic norms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17733.047s">[Callahan]</a>: Winner-take-all elections, which only, sorry, winner-take-all single-seat elections, have a greater likelihood that a constituent's policy beliefs are not represented by their elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17747.333s">[Callahan]</a>: They are susceptible to gerrymandering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17750.795s">[Callahan]</a>: They uniquely disadvantage racial, ethnic, religious, and other political minorities, especially when they are not concentrated geographically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17760.841s">[Callahan]</a>: They also reduce political competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17763.929s">[Callahan]</a>: They create safe zones by creating safe districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17769.15s">[Callahan]</a>: They increase effective polarization, which is also called negative partisanship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17773.594s">[Callahan]</a>: And that means that voters from opposing parties don't just disagree with one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17778.418s">[Callahan]</a>: They actually come to believe that people, voters from the other party are bad people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17784.202s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will say, I've read about this particular thing, negative partisanship, because it is an indication when you have high negative partisanship, it is an indication of a failing democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17796.712s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are beginning to have in America high levels of this effective polarization or negative partisanship, which is not a good sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17807.465s">[Callahan]</a>: They are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17809.895s">[Callahan]</a>: They're high stakes elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17812.397s">[Callahan]</a>: Politicians are worse at problem solving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17816.161s">[Callahan]</a>: They're worse at maintaining democratic norms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17818.243s">[Callahan]</a>: And voters and politicians who lose in win or take all elections are less likely to trust democratic institutions and more likely to resort to violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17829.894s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll just take one quote from one of the organizations that does this kind of research, the organization called Protect Democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17835.999s">[Callahan]</a>: It says, researchers are especially concerned about the use of winner-take-all elections in highly polarized and diverse societies like the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17843.784s">[Callahan]</a>: As one global study of democratization concluded, winner-take-all electoral systems are ill-advised for countries with deep ethnic, regional, religious, or other emotional and polarizing divisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17857.658s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you've fallen asleep because of the wonkiness of all these terms, I'm going to tell you the conclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17865.4s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is the part to really pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17868.921s">[Callahan]</a>: Single-seat, first-past-the-post elections are known, according to experts and researchers, to be among the worst possible methods for getting people appropriately represented in politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17880.484s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm going to rephrase it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17883.604s">[Callahan]</a>: Single-seat first-past-the-post elections, otherwise known as ward or district seats, are, according to most experts, known to be among the worst possible methods for political representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17898.047s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, I'm gonna guess that a lot of progressive heads are spinning around right now because this is not what you hear in progressive circles, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17905.569s">[Callahan]</a>: We've been told that wards are better than at-large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17908.089s">[Callahan]</a>: So why is it that in America, research shows that ward-based is a better system at the city council level, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17918.132s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think there are two important reasons why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17921.893s">[Callahan]</a>: One is the distinction between identity-based representation and policy-based representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17928.294s">[Callahan]</a>: And the other one is historical redlining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17932.176s">[Callahan]</a>: So in America, we have a skewed understanding of what representation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17937.72s">[Callahan]</a>: We think that to be represented, you elect someone similar to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17941.522s">[Callahan]</a>: To have women's issues represented, you elect a woman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17943.923s">[Callahan]</a>: To have black or LGBTQ or immigrant issues represented, you elect someone from one of those groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17949.346s">[Callahan]</a>: If you want to be represented in your city, you elect someone who lives in your ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17953.667s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a fundamentally different understanding from what people in other countries understand to be the essence of representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17960.493s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, I believe, and people in many other countries believe, that true representation politically is when you elect someone who is going to vote the way that you want them to vote on policy, because that is the job that you are electing them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17972.641s">[Callahan]</a>: The argument for wards is based almost entirely on an identity politics viewpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17979.688s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is also why most of the time in cities across America, it is typically Democrats and progressives who want more wards, and Republicans and pro-establishment people who want more at-large representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17991.941s">[Callahan]</a>: Research on wards looks for outcomes based upon identity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=17997.3s">[Callahan]</a>: You have to understand that ward representation research also exists in the reality of American cities that have had historic redlining, meaning that we force minorities to be concentrated in certain districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18013.393s">[Callahan]</a>: From an identity politics perspective, wards hold up pretty well in research in cities that are highly geographically segregated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18022.264s">[Callahan]</a>: people from these historically underrepresented identities are in fact elected more often in these cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18028.31s">[Callahan]</a>: There's not a lot of research on whether it's true from a policy perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18032.794s">[Callahan]</a>: In terms of policy representation, it would be good for more research to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18038.207s">[Callahan]</a>: But it's important to note that when minorities are spread throughout the population, word representation does not even do a good job of bringing in different identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18048.535s">[Callahan]</a>: And in fact, it has shown to be the opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18051.397s">[Callahan]</a>: Multi-seat representation does a better job of electing representatives from minority communities than single-seat districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18058.442s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that's something that's important to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18064.59s">[Callahan]</a>: I think I will go ahead and stop here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18067.732s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are my main reasons why I'm very happy with the idea that we are going to have a nice even mix of award representation and at-large representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18079.159s">[Callahan]</a>: I wrote a blog article for people who want more detail and who want to understand a little bit better and have some insight into what I actually have spent a lot of my time as my day job doing for the last eight years in terms of reinvigorating democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18092.47s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not going to bore you with that here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18093.871s">[Callahan]</a>: It's late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18094.491s">[Callahan]</a>: It's, in fact, not even late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18095.792s">[Callahan]</a>: It's early in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18097.674s">[Callahan]</a>: But you can see my blog for those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18101.136s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to say a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18103.498s">[Callahan]</a>: A final point, one is just that most cities in Massachusetts have larger wards than we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18110.524s">[Callahan]</a>: And there are many cities, I believe Somerville and Lowell are among them, that have wards that are twice our size, which basically means they are wards that are equal to the size of the district in the current city council proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18121.894s">[Callahan]</a>: The other thing I want to say is I find it quite frustrating that the dialogue in the city council meetings has turned into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18129.618s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're for eight wards and three at large, then you are a good and righteous and virtuous person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18134.201s">[Callahan]</a>: But if you vote for four districts and five at large, then you're an evil, power-hungry, and dishonest person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18140.305s">[Callahan]</a>: And I want to mark this as that rhetoric<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18145.188s">[Callahan]</a>: is exactly the kind of polarization that we have come to in America, because we don't have very good electoral systems, and we have this, you know, effective political of a negative partisanship problem, right, this is what these things lead to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18161.201s">[Callahan]</a>: I am hoping that we can all try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18164.384s">[Callahan]</a>: to understand that we don't need to accuse others of being evil and bad, and hopefully also understand that the difference between—these are both hybrid systems—the difference between 8 and 3 and 4 and 5 is not a gigantic difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18179.631s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally think that 4 and 5 is in fact better representation for all the reasons that I said, and I would love it if we can, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18187.659s">[Callahan]</a>: try and tone down a little bit the rhetoric that paints people as being bad people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18194.203s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18195.584s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18730.166s">[Callahan]</a>: It's about number of constituents per councilor, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1027.805s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2079.022s">[Callahan]</a>: Hey there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2079.922s">[Callahan]</a>: So thanks so much for all the work that you've done and all the folks you've talked to and everything that's, you know, I know there's a lot going into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2087.326s">[Callahan]</a>: I had a question as I'm looking over the roles, powers and duties, and please tell me if I'm misreading this, but it does look like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2097.373s">[Callahan]</a>: The, the four essential roles are all related to Medford specifically and I just know from some of the folks I've talked to that they felt that their hands were tied and they were told they were not allowed to discuss human rights, anywhere outside the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2114.515s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just, I wanted to raise that and see what you think as the person working on this document, if you've had those kinds of discussions, you know, maybe I'm wrong and that's, you know, that's not what this does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2126.241s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would just love to get your feedback on that, just Councilor Tang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2192.636s">[Callahan]</a>: I was actually just thinking, instead of deleting the words in Medford, I think it is appropriate that it be about Medford, but I think maybe there could be a, you know, letter E or something that is, you know, sort of, I don't know how to phrase this, but like an outlet for discussion of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2215.07s">[Callahan]</a>: human rights issues that affect the people of Medford, even if those issues are not occurring in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2222.017s">[Callahan]</a>: Because there are, you know, I mean, look, just thinking about the, you know, the great desire here in Medford for a ceasefire earlier last year, that there were many families here who were directly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2236.113s">[Callahan]</a>: affected, directly affected by what was happening abroad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2240.217s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think at least the ability for them to discuss those things and to be a place where people in Medford can go to raise issues of human rights that are affecting them personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2254.129s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know how to phrase it, but I think having that as, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2258.995s">[Callahan]</a>: one thing that they are explicitly allowed to discuss, I think might be a benefit, but I'm open to people's opinions as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2289.162s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2291.983s">[Callahan]</a>: And I did have one other question if I may, and that's about the question of whether the city solicitor is the council or the commission has access to other council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2305.366s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I'm inclined without hearing more about it, I'm sort of inclined to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2314.622s">[Callahan]</a>: say that it probably should be the city solicitor or the council of the city because they are a commission of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2322.186s">[Callahan]</a>: But I would be interested in understanding a little bit more at least of how that would be paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2326.828s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, anyone can go and find another lawyer that they happen to know or get some advice from somebody else, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2334.452s">[Callahan]</a>: But if we're talking about it being like paid legal counsel, I would wanna have some idea of where that funding is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2553.024s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you mind telling me where that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2554.204s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm looking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2568.072s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2714.965s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks, I just wanted to chime in and thank Faringer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2718.547s">[Callahan]</a>: I read that whole part and I believe that you're quite correct that that we're already covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2724.191s">[Callahan]</a>: So Councilor Tseng, no need to add anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2728.133s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that language covers, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4790.376s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I feel similarly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4792.458s">[Callahan]</a>: I suspect that if we do strike that first sentence, then the mayor will have an opinion and, you know, we can like strike it as a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4801.866s">[Callahan]</a>: But if the mayor comes back, I'm not concerned that this will ever be used to say that they cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4810.554s">[Callahan]</a>: use some other legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4811.794s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the fact that we have discussed it here and that we are saying it is our intention that that second sentence means that they are allowed to seek other counsel, I think is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4824.898s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not, I'm not concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4826.498s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think either way is probably fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4828.539s">[Callahan]</a>: And even if we send it to the mayor with only one sentence, only the second sentence, she may send it back with the first one added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4833.84s">[Callahan]</a>: So, which I think would also be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4836.941s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4884.773s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, no, that was that was not intentional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5058.84s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you mind rereading the motion back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5060.76s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5363.53s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5364.691s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to give my own little bit of report back on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5368.093s">[Callahan]</a>: I think my take on it was slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5372.175s">[Callahan]</a>: I did, you know, the first interaction I had with someone after the official hour was over was someone who said that she felt that the whole tone was very angry and that she, you know, felt uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5386.364s">[Callahan]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5389.473s">[Callahan]</a>: being a person who has done other listening sessions, you know, with other groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5394.417s">[Callahan]</a>: I know we have all done some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5396.098s">[Callahan]</a>: But my hope is that for the next one that I attend, I will be more facilitating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5403.503s">[Callahan]</a>: I will come with, you know, some visuals on topics that can be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5411.208s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think that when one or two<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5413.53s">[Callahan]</a>: people dominate the conversation with angry rhetoric, it makes it very difficult for other people to discuss the things that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5423.113s">[Callahan]</a>: And I felt that the conversation that started the second the hour was over were actually conversations that were not pet projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5432.296s">[Callahan]</a>: These were the real<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5434.117s">[Callahan]</a>: things that people are concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5435.978s">[Callahan]</a>: I heard people talk about their need for housing as a senior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5439.54s">[Callahan]</a>: The things that I heard over and over and over at the doors that to me are the primary issues that did not get discussed during that hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5449.924s">[Callahan]</a>: It was things like the lack of transportation for elderly people, that there used to be something called Megan Transport, and there used to be other ways that they could get around the city, but those things are not there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5460.169s">[Callahan]</a>: So they, you know, were wondering what we can do about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5463.711s">[Callahan]</a>: And then some talked about housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5465.913s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, as I mentioned, some of the things that I'm working on, the home sharing, bringing home sharing, matching service to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5475.839s">[Callahan]</a>: And I talked about co-housing, and I talked about, you know, other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5480.303s">[Callahan]</a>: Like the RFP and how the hope is that that will have a lot of smaller units that older people can move into because they talked about wanting to downsize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5488.993s">[Callahan]</a>: So these were the conversations that I think are the, the more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5496.446s">[Callahan]</a>: general ones that many, many seniors want to talk about, and the ones that we ended up talking about for an hour were more the pet projects of like, my street has a pothole in this one place, and I want to know about that pothole, or I want to continue talking about Salem Street, when we already have public forums for talking about the Salem Street zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5517.58s">[Callahan]</a>: That should be something, it's fine if somebody wants to bring it up and talk about it for three minutes, but that shouldn't dominate the conversation at these listening sessions because it prevents us from hearing from the nine-tenths of people who are in attendance who aren't there for that particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5534.457s">[Callahan]</a>: We already have forums for talking about that particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5537.2s">[Callahan]</a>: My plan is that I will be facilitating more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5542.164s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I did take some of these issues and following up with city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5548.77s">[Callahan]</a>: I talked to the economic development director and talking about the RFP, talking about parking near the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5559.198s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll be following up with the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5561.82s">[Callahan]</a>: I followed up with DPW as well with some more general questions about when do they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5570.488s">[Callahan]</a>: plans that they post on the website, like the engineering department actually posted last year, two different plans, like a crack ceiling plan and I believe like a pothole filling plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5580.714s">[Callahan]</a>: And just when were we gonna be able to see those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5583.775s">[Callahan]</a>: Because people do wanna know when these things are going, like which streets are gonna be done next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5589.678s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I was kind of looking for a timeline for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5592.86s">[Callahan]</a>: And just generally following up with city staff on some of the specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5599.104s">[Callahan]</a>: that were coming up during that session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5601.846s">[Callahan]</a>: So I do think it was a good session, but I think that we can do better in terms of our ability to make sure that residents who are showing up at these feel comfortable, that they don't feel like it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5614.515s">[Callahan]</a>: Like they are shut out by a small group that has a particular agenda, but that we are actively asking questions about the things we have an idea that, you know, seniors care about or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5629.946s">[Callahan]</a>: any listening session that it might be, whether it's like parents or folks at West Medford Community Center, or no matter who it is, we might have some facilitated questions where we are asking people, hey, we'd love to know your opinion about, you know, housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5644.269s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, how is housing going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5645.069s">[Callahan]</a>: We want to know your opinion about transportation around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5646.79s">[Callahan]</a>: We want to know your opinion, you know, about, like, how is this affecting you in your life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5651.311s">[Callahan]</a>: So, thank you so much for letting me give a little bit of a longer report back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5656.867s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited that we're doing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5658.468s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think the more of them we do, the better we'll get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5662.089s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm really excited to make them places where residents feel comfortable and welcomed and that they are, their input is, you know, that they can also give input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5672.452s">[Callahan]</a>: And we have kind of a step up, step back, understanding that these are for everyone to contribute equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5679.874s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5680.835s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6002.539s">[Callahan]</a>: Hey, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6003.58s">[Callahan]</a>: I am going to yes and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6006.141s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited about what Councilor Lazzaro was saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6010.043s">[Callahan]</a>: And as often happens with me, I didn't mention that, yes, of course, we also will listen to concerns that people come with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6021.068s">[Callahan]</a>: I think maybe we either have the first half or the second half of the listening session dedicated to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6028.552s">[Callahan]</a>: so that there's a specific time that is like, hey, we're going to ask you questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6033.695s">[Callahan]</a>: And then there's a time that's like, hey, you ask us questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6037.918s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think it's rare that elected officials do the part that I'm talking about, where they're actively asking people, hey, I actually want to know how housing is affecting your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6055.138s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's a piece that I think is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6058.42s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would love to have that piece added to what I think what we have been doing, which is more of an office hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6065.002s">[Callahan]</a>: Office hours is like anybody can show up and they ask you whatever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6069.744s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think the listening session part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6072.265s">[Callahan]</a>: which to me is like finding out from like asking targeted questions and hoping that everyone there can talk about their own experience to give you a picture of how our policies are affecting people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6085.84s">[Callahan]</a>: That is a part that I would love to add as a yes and thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6546.149s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, it's coverage both both sides, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6548.65s">[Callahan]</a>: So it covers the city side and then also the resident side of of the pipes that they determine are lead, which is probably far fewer than we think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6604.484s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, neither.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6605.024s">[Callahan]</a>: It's the city is going to do all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6607.666s">[Callahan]</a>: And the city pays for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6843.252s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually really appreciated that it was formatted properly because it made it look so much more professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6848.515s">[Callahan]</a>: I did read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6849.816s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually thought it was fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6850.957s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm good on the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6853.618s">[Callahan]</a>: I will happily vote in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6968.37s">[Callahan]</a>: Which might I add was the thing that I proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6975.09s">[Callahan]</a>: dearly similar to the things I proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6988.418s">[Callahan]</a>: They were super mad until someone on the other side proposed it and then they loved it, exactly as I said in that council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6996.282s">[Callahan]</a>: You remember I was like, I was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6999.952s">[Callahan]</a>: Never mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7001.233s">[Callahan]</a>: I said what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7001.893s">[Callahan]</a>: And now I said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7172.796s">[Callahan]</a>: I move to approve with edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7175.637s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7226.662s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3574.53s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3575.191s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just want to give my kind of perspective on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3580.973s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, if this were coming into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3585.314s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3592.083s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3593.544s">[Callahan]</a>: So if this were coming into, because I was not on the governance committee, if this were coming into this body, whether it was eight and three or five and four, four and five, I guess, either way, I would vote in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3606.971s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that we want a combination of more localized members as well as at-large members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3616.716s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is what I am for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3620.151s">[Callahan]</a>: So either way, whichever of those it was, I would be voting in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3625.055s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it is also fair to say that the survey that the study committee did included a question about combination of wards and at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3641.23s">[Callahan]</a>: It did not ever ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3643.927s">[Callahan]</a>: whether that should be four districts or eight wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3649.159s">[Callahan]</a>: A little odd because they are recommending four<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3653.401s">[Callahan]</a>: for school committee and eight for city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3656.183s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems like maybe you include that in your survey so that you can get that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3663.27s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally don't believe that we have any idea how many people in Medford would prefer the eight wards versus how many people in Medford would prefer four districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3673.119s">[Callahan]</a>: I think I can look at the numbers right now, people who want a combination of wards and at large, and you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3682.498s">[Callahan]</a>: I get it that ward in Medford means a very specific thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3686.339s">[Callahan]</a>: I think our wards in Medford are quite small compared to a lot of the other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3691.701s">[Callahan]</a>: So combination of some sort of localized and at large is 60% of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3696.263s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is what we are voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3700.904s">[Callahan]</a>: To stay as is, meaning all at large, 18% of people think we should stay all at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3706.466s">[Callahan]</a>: 17% of people think we should be all wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3713.749s">[Callahan]</a>: you have approximately the same number of people who think it should stay like 20%, 20% almost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3718.591s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like 18%, 17% say that it should be all at large, 17% say it should be all ward, and 60% say it should be a combination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3727.514s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there's a decent argument to say that something that is near half and half is maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3738.327s">[Callahan]</a>: something that people in Medford want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3741.268s">[Callahan]</a>: It's unfortunate that we really have no idea whether the community would prefer eight or four, because that was never asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3750.19s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to push back a little bit on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3752.271s">[Callahan]</a>: We know absolutely certainly that everyone in Medford wants eight words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3756.312s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that that question was ever asked or answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3760.893s">[Callahan]</a>: And, uh, yeah, like I said, I would be in favor of mixed whether it was eight or four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3766.98s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I think going to a slightly larger council is good too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3769.923s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so that's just my position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4722.432s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4722.832s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually wanted to bring up a totally different topic, the topic of ranked choice voting for single seat elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4731.119s">[Callahan]</a>: So that would be any districts or wards as well as the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4736.484s">[Callahan]</a>: And I apologize that I did not attend the final<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4742.844s">[Callahan]</a>: and I don't know whether this was discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4746.645s">[Callahan]</a>: I was not on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4747.726s">[Callahan]</a>: I did try to attend the other two meetings, but I would love to raise the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4753.749s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, and here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4755.97s">[Callahan]</a>: From folks about the topic of ranked choice voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6751.841s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11857.347s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11857.667s">[Callahan]</a>: So I have downloaded from the state of Massachusetts, a database that includes the sizes of all wards and precincts of every city and town in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11871.275s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will say it looks like most cities, and of course we're only looking at cities because towns have a totally different government structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11881.901s">[Callahan]</a>: So we're only looking at cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11892.167s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, this database includes all towns and cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11894.789s">[Callahan]</a>: All municipalities in all of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11903.986s">[Callahan]</a>: sadly, this particular database, I wish I'd done this before, because I would have marked them as cities or towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11907.967s">[Callahan]</a>: So this particular database does not in fact tell me which ones are cities, which ones are towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11913.848s">[Callahan]</a>: But as I am looking through it, I've gone up through letter N, and I have not yet found any cities that have wards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11930.59s">[Callahan]</a>: as small as our wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11932.37s">[Callahan]</a>: So far, everything looks about twice as large, one and a half times as large, three times as large in terms of population, just the population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11943.833s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I mean, look at Chelsea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11945.633s">[Callahan]</a>: And some of these are considerably smaller cities than we are in population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11950.834s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that really matters, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11952.675s">[Callahan]</a>: But it looks like Chelsea's are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11959.184s">[Callahan]</a>: twice the size of ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11964.048s">[Callahan]</a>: Chicopee actually would be similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11971.155s">[Callahan]</a>: Everett, we're looking one and a half times, not quite one and a half times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11980.983s">[Callahan]</a>: Somerville are twice the size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11983.566s">[Callahan]</a>: Fall River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11987.476s">[Callahan]</a>: more than one and a half times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11991.499s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just looking, I understand that people want local representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11997.302s">[Callahan]</a>: And I understand that we are unusual in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12001.525s">[Callahan]</a>: And I made the argument last time that in other states, we are not at all unusual in terms of the representation that we have, either the current representation that we have in terms of being at large, because all over the country, that still is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12018.148s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think the point I'm trying to make is the argument that we should definitely be wards, because that is just like all the other Massachusetts cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12032.475s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, I would love to dig a little bit more into this database.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12035.676s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not sort of trying to understand at a glance, like, am I making sure we're looking at, I think all of those I mentioned are cities and not towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12045.902s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would want to double check that those are in fact the ones that are, that the size of the wards are as listed, the things that are listed as wards, though they each have like a person per ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12061.415s">[Callahan]</a>: But it does look like our wards are smaller than most cities wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12067.74s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12222.637s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, I gotta correct myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12223.957s">[Callahan]</a>: Chicopee would be smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12226.618s">[Callahan]</a>: And I haven't dug deeply into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=12228.879s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is really just kind of trying to get a sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1413.781s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1414.822s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I appreciate so much that you're here again, I was there at the library with you and I was with, you know, with one of your very first meetings with Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1423.549s">[Callahan]</a>: I, I really have heard from you guys very clearly that this is not about just rec programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1430.995s">[Callahan]</a>: I loved the way that you phrased it about it including restaurants and places of worship and meetings and events, live entertainment, holidays, employment, the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1440.719s">[Callahan]</a>: There's so many things that we could be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1444.2s">[Callahan]</a>: My volunteer team has found a volunteer who is a specialist in special ed, both in her work and in her education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1452.803s">[Callahan]</a>: And what I'm hoping we can do is set up a meeting where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1460.224s">[Callahan]</a>: the group and this volunteer and I can all meet together because I believe that she has volunteered to do 20 to 40 hours over the next few months, and budget season is coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1474.551s">[Callahan]</a>: So if she can pull on all these threads and find out and do the legwork that the mayor is gonna want to hear,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1483.375s">[Callahan]</a>: about what this is actually going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1487.66s">[Callahan]</a>: She can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1488.641s">[Callahan]</a>: She wants to volunteer to do that, then we'll be able to have something that is much more concrete for the mayor to approve of in budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1497.751s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is where I think this volunteer is going to be really incredibly helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1503.157s">[Callahan]</a>: is to hear all of the ways, all of the ideas that you guys have and the ways that Medford could be like this, you know, the inclusion specialist that you want to be housed somewhere in the city, the ways that that person could bring these kinds of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1520.555s">[Callahan]</a>: And that way, she can do the legwork<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1523.077s">[Callahan]</a>: to ensure that the mayor feels comfortable with funding this position and also where in the budget and where this person should be housed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1532.62s">[Callahan]</a>: I think having that volunteer do that legwork before budget season is the way that we're gonna be able to have this placed in the best place that you guys feel comfortable with it being funded in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1554.518s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, I think my suggestion has been that we meet with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1560.103s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, I would love to see her here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1563.085s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if she's coming tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1565.287s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we need to have like a deeper, like her hearing this meeting would be great, but having a deeper discussion where she can really dig in and ask tons of questions to you guys, that's going to be a lot deeper than this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1577.717s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1583.851s">[Callahan]</a>: But let's set up a meeting where I can be there, she can be there, we can make sure that we get this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1588.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3339.9s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3340.92s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks for all this work that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3342.961s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm hoping, can you give us a little bit more of the big picture?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3345.962s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I know that we have like 125 year old water lines throughout the city and it's hundreds of millions of dollars for us to replace them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3354.365s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you fit this into the context of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3356.045s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that this is a specific APA project that has a deadline, but give us a little bit of context in terms of how does it fit into our sort of longer term plans to replace these aging pipes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3454.158s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it safe to say that like, this is just the very end of like the sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3459.822s">[Callahan]</a>: roots or tree branches or whatever you want to call it, of the water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3462.924s">[Callahan]</a>: So at this point, because of the deadline and the funding, we're going to be working at the ends of the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3470.368s">[Callahan]</a>: And that after that, when that deadline is no longer pressing, that we will move on to working to the rest of the aging water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3829.163s">[Callahan]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3833.241s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks, just one super quick question, and I think you already said it, but if you can repeat, when would this work be completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3841.326s">[Callahan]</a>: Approximately, do we have any ideas?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.106s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.867s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm specifically thinking of some constituents who have reached out to me and like begged me for any sort of resources that they can do that they can possibly get for replacing their lines because they know they have lead in their water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3886.265s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you have any thoughts on should they just pay to do it themselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3891.228s">[Callahan]</a>: If they replace their part, but then the other part isn't replaced, is that then possibly going to be worse?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3897.692s">[Callahan]</a>: What should they do, given that they're concerned right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4002.861s">[Callahan]</a>: It's so incredibly helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4007.543s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4379.263s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4381.506s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, I wish there were much more that we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4385.011s">[Callahan]</a>: It is really, I believe, quite ridiculous that we cannot actually get this without a home rule petition, which is almost certainly going to be denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4394.083s">[Callahan]</a>: We should be getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4397.5s">[Callahan]</a>: real estate taxes from these large institutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4401.564s">[Callahan]</a>: A master plan is really small potatoes, and it is quite frustrating that we have to do a homeown petition, and it is unlikely to be approved, but I am certainly in favor of this homeown petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4412.674s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4413.876s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4091.055s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted a super quick clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4092.797s">[Callahan]</a>: It sounds like you're saying that if we don't do anything differently, and this is a UR1, but there's a lot of single family homes, they will not be able to build an ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4105.208s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to have a little check in, maybe I missed it, but that we can, in fact, write something into the zoning to ensure that they will be able to do an ADU by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4143.423s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're not like allowing ADUs in all the single family places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4147.264s">[Callahan]</a>: But if there happens to be a single family home in a, you know, zoned something that's not single family, that they're not then not allowed to do the same thing all the other single families are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4155.246s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5639.473s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5641.214s">[Callahan]</a>: So I so appreciate you looking into this and especially into where they these small commercial districts already exist in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5650.878s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say as we have gone through this whole zoning process, I think the thing I am most excited about is what I have been calling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5659.121s">[Callahan]</a>: community mixed use, which I think is exactly what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5662.783s">[Callahan]</a>: The idea, and I phrased it as, you know, within a half mile of every home, having a corner where people can go and there would be a space that was co-working by day, community events by night, there would be a cafe, there could be a bookstore, you know, a small grocery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5683.535s">[Callahan]</a>: So all of these things, and I love the reframing that I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5688.337s">[Callahan]</a>: a five minute walk to an ice cream shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5691.341s">[Callahan]</a>: Everyone should be five minutes from ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5693.063s">[Callahan]</a>: So these things I think to me are what I'm the most excited is to really bring walkability and the neighborhood feeling and the idea that you're going to get to know your neighbors in this specific place that really is designed for you to meet the people who live<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5709.901s">[Callahan]</a>: on your block, two blocks over near you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5714.464s">[Callahan]</a>: And in part, what I am really hoping for is as I talk to people who have lived in Medford for a very long time, one of the things that they don't like about the changes that are happening is that they have known their neighbors their whole lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5732.396s">[Callahan]</a>: And they really feel this break with the people who are new here who aren't getting to know their neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5739.24s">[Callahan]</a>: That that is, is troublesome and, and I personally agree as someone who has moved often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5746.366s">[Callahan]</a>: I wish that I knew my neighbors better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5748.608s">[Callahan]</a>: I wish there was somewhere that I could go I mean for me it's Colette bakery, because, you know, we pass it every day that we go to school and so we stop in and we know people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5757.415s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think everyone should have a place, whether they have lived here for 50 years, or whether they just moved here, they should be able to walk somewhere that they will have an opportunity to get to know their neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5770.88s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is very exciting to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5773.061s">[Callahan]</a>: And among the uses, I would love for us to consider children's and teens activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5780.024s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I think that is also something that I hear often from residents is that we don't have enough activities for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5787.649s">[Callahan]</a>: And if there were something that were walkable, especially teenagers, that's like a great opportunity to have something where teenagers can go and hang out, it's a safe space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5800.517s">[Callahan]</a>: where they're a few blocks from home, they're very close by, and yet it's also designed for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5806.021s">[Callahan]</a>: So those are the kinds of considerations that I'm thinking of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5809.123s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm hoping, I apologize if this was already sent out, but I got the full color maps of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5817.75s">[Callahan]</a>: the proposed zoning and the existing use, but I didn't get the map of this one that has these existing commercial spots in the neighborhoods, and I would love to have that if that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6416.588s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6417.288s">[Callahan]</a>: And I did want to just respond quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6419.29s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the reason why this is one of the more major changes that is happening in the residential zoning is this very specific spot, because it was single family too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6430.46s">[Callahan]</a>: And now we are changing it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6433.467s">[Callahan]</a>: urban residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6435.208s">[Callahan]</a>: And the reason is because there's a brand new T stop that, you know, 10 years ago, did we even know 10 years ago that it was going to come to there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6444.03s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe around 10 years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6445.83s">[Callahan]</a>: We hoped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6446.47s">[Callahan]</a>: But the zoning is 37 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6449.471s">[Callahan]</a>: So like 37 years ago when this zoning was written, that T stop was not even a twinkling in the eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6457.153s">[Callahan]</a>: of the person who ended up planning the T stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6460.455s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is why this particular neighborhood is seeing such a change is because it really is right where that T stop is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6468.039s">[Callahan]</a>: And the whole rest of the city is going to see much less change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6471.862s">[Callahan]</a>: So I do understand that this, you know, for folks who live in this neighborhood, you know, we may want to have more discussions and really talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6480.407s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is also why I was, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6482.988s">[Callahan]</a>: wanted to deeply ask these questions about like I want to make sure that single family homes, people who only have single family homes in this particular neighborhood are able to do with their homes, what every other single family homeowner can do in Medford, that I think is very important that they be able to do, you know, an ad you that they be able to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6505.332s">[Callahan]</a>: put on a porch or whatever it is that they want to do to their single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6509.053s">[Callahan]</a>: I do not want people to, I think we already have too much turnover in this city, you know, because of the skyrocketing housing prices and the pressure on people to, you know, sell and move somewhere cheaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6522.999s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to make sure that the folks who currently live here is the people that we're serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6527.9s">[Callahan]</a>: But this is this one neighborhood is going to be the spot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6532.002s">[Callahan]</a>: that looks like in the zoning in terms of the residential neighborhoods does get the most change, and it is purely because of that T-stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1338.39s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1339.631s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I really want to thank Councilor Lazzaro, of course, for bringing this forward and working with residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1345.074s">[Callahan]</a>: I do want to thank the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1346.675s">[Callahan]</a>: Their letter is incredibly well thought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1350.798s">[Callahan]</a>: The requests they have made are well thought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1354.2s">[Callahan]</a>: They have gotten many, many, many signatures for people signing on to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1361.884s">[Callahan]</a>: So they've done a lot of organizing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1363.746s">[Callahan]</a>: I think, and I completely agree with Councilor Lazzaro that it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1368.068s">[Callahan]</a>: incredibly frustrating that deaths, injuries, accidents continue to happen, and we do not have the ability to have the control that our residents would like us to have over these roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1387.517s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, even just in the question of like whether signage is put up saying what the speed limit is the correct speed limit so you know even small things small requests go unanswered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1397.404s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to ask a little bit of a procedural question I hope it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1402.548s">[Callahan]</a>: This is by no means to not say that this is an important topic but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1408.69s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it actually allowed for motions to be put in remembrances, and I'm only wondering because I think there may be people in the community who would want to know about this and might want to speak on this topic but they wouldn't look in remembrances for promotions that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1424.696s">[Callahan]</a>: And my only suggestion, like I've been thinking about whether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1429.338s">[Callahan]</a>: It would be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1430.398s">[Callahan]</a>: I know there's been an email thread with more data about the state roads and accidents happening there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1438.083s">[Callahan]</a>: There is data online that we can see about injuries, deaths, accidents happening on the state roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1445.868s">[Callahan]</a>: That data is available to us online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1449.29s">[Callahan]</a>: And I was wondering if we might think about putting this either in a committee to then go to City Council, but having Todd Blake, who's our traffic guy or anyone else that that folks think is the appropriate person to talk to us about navigating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1468.557s">[Callahan]</a>: our relationship with DCR and what we can maybe provide, is there anything that we can do to push DCR to take action more quickly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1478.988s">[Callahan]</a>: So I guess there's, like, should we move this to committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1483.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Can these motions be done in a remembrance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1486.817s">[Callahan]</a>: And then...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1488.739s">[Callahan]</a>: I had one other suggestion, which is wondering if city councilors can sign on to this letter, if that would be more impactful for us also to sign on to the letter to maybe send to our state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1148.021s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan, sorry, I'm still working on the mics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1152.649s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't have a motion exactly but I would, I think it's probably easiest to just keep it in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1158.394s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think there's current urgency because of the state that we live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1162.778s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would, I would say we just keep it in this committee and then we take it up next month when we've got the legal review and go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1313.644s">[Callahan]</a>: As long as we have finished and everyone has spoken, I would move that we adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1765.142s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1765.402s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a little bit more of a general question about this whole section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1771.423s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just, I do have a question for the chair of the study committee who I so appreciate being here in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1779.845s">[Callahan]</a>: I didn't see any survey questions about strong mayor versus weak mayor or about the strength of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1786.847s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding is we have one of the strongest mayoral sort of systems in the whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1794.649s">[Callahan]</a>: and country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1796.09s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm just curious if there was discussion among the community that you heard how much of the, you know, whether this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1810.143s">[Callahan]</a>: was talked about on the commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1814.005s">[Callahan]</a>: And specifically, I'm really talking about appointments, both department heads, as well as boards of commissions, the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1822.749s">[Callahan]</a>: And it just comes up in here because of the ability of the mayor to veto<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1829.552s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, anything coming out of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1831.293s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm just curious kind of how the sort of strong Mayor Week Mayor fit into the discussions both internally within the committee as well as more broadly within the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2965.208s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks, I didn't mean to interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2967.309s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a super quick question about we did pass a budget ordinance and I know that the charter basically is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2975.96s">[Callahan]</a>: that takes precedence over ordinances in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2978.981s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm curious how you might see this piece of the charter and the ordinance that we passed as interacting with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2986.403s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, you may not know about the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2987.704s">[Callahan]</a>: The ordinance basically lays out a timeline for when the mayor will provide certain information and different meetings that the state council will have with department heads to understand their individual budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2999.007s">[Callahan]</a>: So it has this more details, and I don't really know if the actual dates are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=3006.585s">[Callahan]</a>: probably not identical to these, but I'm just curious if you have an understanding of how that, would that ordinance kind of be washed away or would that ordinance just be assumed to be fine unless it's specifically against the charter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=485.963s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, but to me, that is a little, like, I would not get from that what I think you mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=490.964s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=491.184s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=491.864s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm happy to, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=492.404s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, that sounds like when you push this off to the other, whereas we're still discussing it internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=498.066s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just be, if you want to probably say no decisions have been made yet, I would say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=506.707s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, a little more direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=767.78s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=768.021s">[Callahan]</a>: Just two minor edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=769.642s">[Callahan]</a>: The first is under planning and permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=771.864s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that we just found out today at planning and permitting that they're not going to be, the CDB is not going to be talking about Salem Street on February 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=785.175s">[Callahan]</a>: They pushed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=785.876s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=786.736s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just don't want to put February 5th because I'm pretty sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=790.344s">[Callahan]</a>: they are not talking about it on February 5th, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=794.667s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=796.428s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the second one, and this is very minor, but under public works, the last sentence, we also heard from the commissioner and city engineer on the possibility of, the city engineer did not chime in and had nothing to say, so we just removed the city engineer part of that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=813.339s">[Callahan]</a>: The city engineer was really there to talk about the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=820.593s">[Callahan]</a>: So the last sentence should read, we also heard from the commissioner on the possibility of, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1640.442s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, these are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1641.703s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the fact that you're for each one of these, you're asking, does staff have the capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1647.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you see any ethical concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1649.649s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, these are, these are great questions to ask to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1653.352s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just ask the mayor's office as well, what other data aside from these she thinks would be interesting, or might be helpful to the to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1665.2s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I don't know if the health department has data that would be interesting or helpful to the community to understand over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1670.382s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, you know, there are maybe other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1673.003s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, you know, we have our housing department is incredibly small, not even a department, but you know, with housing data that we have over time, like there are other things that might be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1683.826s">[Callahan]</a>: And so just adding that one question to the mayor's office would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1686.987s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1950.078s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1951.338s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, I so appreciate you bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1954.781s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think that that's a real concern given the skeletal nature of many of our departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1961.366s">[Callahan]</a>: And I guess what I would say is staff capacity is a question people can answer many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1966.57s">[Callahan]</a>: People could say, well, if you pass it, we have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1968.852s">[Callahan]</a>: So yes, you have the staff capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1970.013s">[Callahan]</a>: They could say, no, we don't have the staff capacity because we're already at our max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1975.245s">[Callahan]</a>: even if it's five minutes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1976.986s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think adding a question of a rough cost estimate would be more helpful because that would, some people might say, yeah, that'll, you know, it would take me two hours to do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1991.274s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1992.014s">[Callahan]</a>: And another person might be like, yeah, that's gonna be like five hours a week for the next six months, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1997.237s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think having an idea<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1999.498s">[Callahan]</a>: of what each department thinks might be the cost to putting it up for the first time and or keeping it maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2005.902s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that would be helpful information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2544.697s">[Callahan]</a>: For the amendment, can we send it to the mayor first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2551.517s">[Callahan]</a>: Wait, give the mayor a heads up before we send it to the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2554.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2556.166s">[Callahan]</a>: My assumption was that it was going to go to the mayor first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2560.215s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I jump in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2584.02s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2601.449s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=7.698s">[Callahan]</a>: Make sure you go to ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1960.67s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1961.971s">[Callahan]</a>: I, myself, am very excited that we're going to have some meetings about zoning that are not in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1967.695s">[Callahan]</a>: Going out, you know, where the people are, places that people feel more comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1972.618s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1973.919s">[Callahan]</a>: I get that we are under-resourced, but I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's push for us to really do more and to do our best effort to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1988.069s">[Callahan]</a>: all this information out to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1991.59s">[Callahan]</a>: And that being said, I do want to make a comment that we have been, am I correct, 37 years without zoning changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2002.993s">[Callahan]</a>: Over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2004.693s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's closer to 40, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2007.214s">[Callahan]</a>: Close to 40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2011.492s">[Callahan]</a>: Not deciding to not change anything is a decision, and the world changes and the demographics of our city changes and coven happens and you know things happen in the world the.com bust in the 2000s happened and, you know, things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2026.88s">[Callahan]</a>: change in the world and in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2029.542s">[Callahan]</a>: And the choice for the city council to not change the zoning is a choice, as much as a change is a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2037.107s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally have talked to many people who, you know, have been wanting a lot of the changes, zoning and legislative that we have, you know, on our governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2047.983s">[Callahan]</a>: have said to me, I've lived here for 30 years and I have wanted these things to happen for 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2052.987s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought they would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2054.688s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm so excited that finally some of these things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2058.55s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think, you know, it's just important to remember that while change is hard, the whole world changes and zoning needs to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2068.037s">[Callahan]</a>: A lot of the zoning things that we are doing is bringing things to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2072.44s">[Callahan]</a>: the current non-conforming structures that exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2076.321s">[Callahan]</a>: So in many places, we're not, you know, yes, we are changing many things, but there are places where we're simply trying to reflect what actually currently exists because what's built there is not conforming to this old zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2090.763s">[Callahan]</a>: And on that note, I did have just one small request that in some of our educational materials, I don't know whether it be the videos or just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2100.865s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, infographics that we create or in the writing or whatever that might be, I think it's important for people to be able to see very simply what the old zoning said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2112.24s">[Callahan]</a>: what currently exists and is non-conforming, and what the new zoning says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2118.123s">[Callahan]</a>: And if people are especially concerned about heights and about density.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2122.426s">[Callahan]</a>: So in very simple, as much as we can have incredibly simple ways of describing, here's the old zoning, here's the new zoning, and here's what is currently built, and why you can see that in these places, we're actually not changing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2136.994s">[Callahan]</a>: We're literally, we're changing the zoning, but we're only making it meet what exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2140.616s">[Callahan]</a>: and in these other places where we are changing the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2144.038s">[Callahan]</a>: I think those, you know, as much as we can simplify it for people, that would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2149.142s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4561.79s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4563.271s">[Callahan]</a>: So I know that in the first proposal, then it was amended by President Bears, and I just wanted to kind of note that in the amended, sorry, in the proposal two, there are, interestingly, there is a part of the northern part of West Medford that even in the before amended proposal one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4588.103s">[Callahan]</a>: was Neighborhood Residential 1, which was nothing but single-unit dwelling plus ADU and historic conversion, amended to be a larger portion that was only gonna be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4602.712s">[Callahan]</a>: And now in Proposal 2, it's actually Neighborhood Residential 2, and so it allows two units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4608.075s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that portion, and when I look at the reality, there are no two-unit dwellings there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4614.219s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4616.04s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want us to be careful that places, and I think this was the intention, President Bears, of the proposal that you made, which I was supportive of, please correct me if I'm wrong, but that in single-family areas that were single-family that are in fact single-family, there are no two units currently built there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4642.084s">[Callahan]</a>: That I think I certainly felt that adding a to use and historic conversion was the right amount of change for those areas and I believe there are two areas, one is the northern part of North Medford and the other one is a triangle in Lawrence estates, but that both of those cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4660.279s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would be totally like every resident there is like, yeah, let's have two fellows here but my guess is that that's probably not going to be the reaction that we get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4669.456s">[Callahan]</a>: So, that would be my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4672.981s">[Callahan]</a>: inclination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4674.282s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't know if other councillors would be supportive of that, but I think that was kind of what President Bears's amendment was going towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4683.227s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wonder if we could, you know, come to some sort of agreement on whether we think that that's a good idea to roll it back, especially the northern west Medford part, roll it back to neighborhood residential planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4703.077s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4703.838s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you look at the difference between the proposed neighborhood residential districts version 1 and the amended proposal 1, and I believe that is President Bearsar's amendment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4720.227s">[Callahan]</a>: in both of those, the very northern part of West Medford, that thing that goes way up by the lakes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4729.352s">[Callahan]</a>: In both of those, it is neighborhood residential one, both in the original and also in the amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4736.495s">[Callahan]</a>: And if you now look at proposal two, that I believe is neighborhood residential two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4861.622s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I could make a motion, but I don't know if a motion is really necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4865.304s">[Callahan]</a>: I feel like if there's some consensus on this committee, then we can trust our Innocence Associates planners to do a slight revision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5032.127s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5032.687s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I make a suggestion then that if a councilor wants to propose something that maybe we say, are there any objections to, then we don't have to vote or anything and people don't have to every single person chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5043.293s">[Callahan]</a>: It's a little bit simpler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5045.974s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will make the first one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5047.375s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say, are there any objections to the very northernmost part of West Bedford as it goes up Grove Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5058.493s">[Callahan]</a>: Somewhere in there, there being a boundary between Neighborhood Residential 1 and Neighborhood Residential 2, currently it's all Neighborhood Residential 2, let the furthest north part be Residential 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5071.429s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think we can kind of look at the original proposal before the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5077.525s">[Callahan]</a>: that that may be a good place to look at for the differential between one and two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5082.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Any objections to them making a change like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=820.844s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I found them in order pending, tiny, tiny corrections that I sent to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=930.723s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=931.023s">[Callahan]</a>: At the Public Works Committee, we had Commissioner Tim McGivern and our engineer Omar Tella to give us an update on the roads, both their conditions, as well as how they are going to be spending the new $500,000 per year from the overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=947.989s">[Callahan]</a>: And we also discussed the potential of having volunteer residents helping to plant city trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2251.932s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2252.713s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I do want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing forward a number of ideas that I think are really pertinent to what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2260.48s">[Callahan]</a>: I know it's quite difficult to get information out to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2265.305s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, I do hope that we can do a better job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2271.07s">[Callahan]</a>: of informing people on a topic that is as important as these overrides and the way that it's going to affect their taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2280.732s">[Callahan]</a>: There are a number of things in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2281.773s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanna state where I am on these various different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2285.734s">[Callahan]</a>: The listening and education sessions, I think are fantastic idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2288.614s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm always a fan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2289.575s">[Callahan]</a>: I would love to be at them and help as much as I am able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2293.235s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe as I think Vice President Collins<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2300.277s">[Callahan]</a>: mentioned that we have maxed out our ability to the statewide exemptions for our seniors, veterans, disabled, and other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2311.919s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that we are already at the max, but I think asking our state representatives what else, what more we can do is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2320.46s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm personally in favor of the homeowner exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2323.321s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that not everyone on the council is, or at least I don't want to guarantee that everyone on the council is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2329.862s">[Callahan]</a>: I think looking into that and beginning that discussion now so that we are in time to be able to make that decision later in the year is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2340.047s">[Callahan]</a>: Absolutely getting information about the abatement process as quickly as possible in every means possible would be fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2348.972s">[Callahan]</a>: Any grants and fees that can be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2351.454s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I certainly am in favor of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2354.337s">[Callahan]</a>: So, that is where I said I am in favor of both this proposal as well as the proposal so I will vote for both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5142.353s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5143.473s">[Callahan]</a>: In addition to amending this, I assume it's what you're suggesting that we amended to send it to a governance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5152.057s">[Callahan]</a>: I wonder if we could also do a friendly amendment to just add in language saying we urge our fellow councilors to not place other items of discussion before these hearings from business leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5169.145s">[Callahan]</a>: Business people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5172.042s">[Callahan]</a>: because a lot of the problem it sounds like is that we just, you know, we take things out of order and then we end up accidentally pushing these things until 11 o'clock at night when really let's not do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5705.401s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5708.797s">[Callahan]</a>: I absolutely so appreciated our former messenger, Lera Lepore, who's a wonderful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5717.904s">[Callahan]</a>: I do hope that we can update the messenger role a little bit given<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5724.62s">[Callahan]</a>: know, the digital age and that we may not need the exact services that were in his job description before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5731.507s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say that if the city is going to hire a staff person for the city council, if the city council has a staff person, I would hope that some of their time might be dedicated to constituent services, which I think in, you know, most cities that is one of the first staff that is hired for a city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5750.485s">[Callahan]</a>: in, you know, there are certain cities, Cambridge and other cities, where every city councilor has a staff person who basically does constituent services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5757.591s">[Callahan]</a>: I think constituent services are incredibly important to the number of emails that we receive with people who have questions, you know, that really are questions for the administration of us, you know, sending them to the right administrative person in the, you know, in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5773.505s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm hoping that either<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5777.408s">[Callahan]</a>: the messenger position can be one that can do a little bit of that kind of work and less driving around to deliver us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5788.415s">[Callahan]</a>: As much as I enjoyed having the paper copies of the agendas delivered to my door, I hope that maybe some of that time can be used for constituent services and that we can just kind of look at that role and update it for the 21st century.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5801.604s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6638.71s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6639.451s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I want to thank you for all of the meetings that you attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6642.733s">[Callahan]</a>: You're one of our most engaged residents here in Bedford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6645.956s">[Callahan]</a>: And the fact that you happen not to be at that meeting is completely understandable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6651.0s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm glad that you're here asking this question, because most residents don't, in fact, go and look back at the committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6657.905s">[Callahan]</a>: But they may, in fact, come and look at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6662.069s">[Callahan]</a>: And you asked some questions that I asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6664.05s">[Callahan]</a>: So I specifically asked Commissioner McIvern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6665.932s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, I can go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6666.832s">[Callahan]</a>: No, no, not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6668.033s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, I think it's important that we do discuss these things here at the official regular City Council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6673.555s">[Callahan]</a>: I did ask about resurfacing because I know with roads, you can save a lot of money by doing that kind of repair in between, and so I asked if maybe we would be able to save money in the future by doing these kinds of intermediary repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6685.92s">[Callahan]</a>: He said, as President Bears noted, that unfortunately, because of the nature of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6692.682s">[Callahan]</a>: playing tennis, that it might affect the way the ball bounces that might cause people to sprain ankles, that doing those kinds of repairs doesn't actually work on the kind of surface also as noted that the underlying, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6709.173s">[Callahan]</a>: structure just needs to be repaired at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6712.195s">[Callahan]</a>: And then importantly, I think also Councilor Scarpelli noted, if I may, to let me know if I'm wrong, that the high school uses this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6722.264s">[Callahan]</a>: Like it is a very used tennis courts that really, Medford really would suffer if we did without.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6729.71s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I appreciate your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8137.658s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, I don't have a memorized who's microphone or who's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8145.964s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8146.805s">[Callahan]</a>: So as a general rule, I'm often hesitant for the city to sell off its owned property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8155.351s">[Callahan]</a>: And this particular proposal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8158.593s">[Callahan]</a>: I have quite a few questions about, we have a newly formed affordable housing trust, it is looking into community land trusts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8167.002s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems like city properties where housing can be built are perfect candidates for community land trust, you know, land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8176.071s">[Callahan]</a>: I am like the language in this seems vaguely to point toward the funding probably being used for portable housing but not necessarily it says for general municipal purposes and or for the purpose of disposition on such terms and conditions as in the best interest of the city like these to me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8199.143s">[Callahan]</a>: what we are doing is handing over to the mayor the ability to sell a city property with no conditions, and I am not comfortable with that, with the way that this is worded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8208.266s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would have a lot of questions about how the Affordable Housing Trust fits into this, why there is a rush when the Affordable Housing Trust is probably not really prepared to deal with land right now because they're in the early stages, and we don't yet have a community land trust, why we are now suddenly desperately selling something that has not been used since 1950,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8229.171s">[Callahan]</a>: So I have quite a few questions, and I don't believe I will be prepared to vote in favor of this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8736.187s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, just a hypothetical question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8739.649s">[Callahan]</a>: Looking down the line, if, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8742.933s">[Callahan]</a>: this land were not to be sold and were to be, is it possible for the city to transfer ownership of this land to the Affordable Housing Trust or to a community land trust, should we have one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1841.181s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, and I so appreciate the, first of all, the work from the commission and also the Collins Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1848.606s">[Callahan]</a>: I am not a member of this committee, so thank you so much for allowing me to ask a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1855.49s">[Callahan]</a>: This is on the same exact point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1857.191s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that, for example, when we were working to try and reduce the rodent population, that the person sponsoring a piece of legislation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1868.43s">[Callahan]</a>: was communicating with the staff in order to understand best how we can help the staff through the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1874.971s">[Callahan]</a>: The staff needed an ordinance to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1876.932s">[Callahan]</a>: And so working together with staff to understand how we can best tailor the ordinance to meet the needs of the staff, that to me, like, I'm 100% in favor of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1891.825s">[Callahan]</a>: nor shall any member of the city council give orders or direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1894.967s">[Callahan]</a>: Absolutely, I 100% agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1899.229s">[Callahan]</a>: It just says, you know, the city council shall contact only solely through the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1904.072s">[Callahan]</a>: And it seems like getting information on how to craft ordinances to best meet the needs of staff, that's, I just wanna make sure, again, we're all asking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1918.259s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1919.399s">[Callahan]</a>: I just specifically, I mean, I wasn't the sponsor of rodent control, but I know how much, you know, that was something staff needed and that the sponsor of that ordinance needed to just hear from and worked with staff members to craft it carefully so that it met the needs of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1936.866s">[Callahan]</a>: So those kinds of things I think are important that we are able to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1941.967s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.165s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.525s">[Callahan]</a>: I just had one quick question, which I think Councilor Bears may have just answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4410.547s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not clear to me who is on the committee or who puts people on the committee, but it sounds like what Councilor Bears is suggesting is that it says, this review shall be made by a special committee to be established by a vote of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4424.371s">[Callahan]</a>: So that would be the council that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4426.864s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to understand what that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.026s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6464.553s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6467.214s">[Callahan]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6469.831s">[Callahan]</a>: So I definitely am in favor of having a hybrid system that has some wards or districts and some at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6482.416s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, whether it is four districts, eight wards, each of our wards has two parts, that would be 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6491.2s">[Callahan]</a>: That to me is not as much of the question in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6496.656s">[Callahan]</a>: do we have boards or districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6498.317s">[Callahan]</a>: If we have four districts, we have eight wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6500.257s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, we are still using, like forming these more local elected offices, which I am in favor of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6512.721s">[Callahan]</a>: I do definitely appreciate a lot of what President Bears has said about first past the post, single district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6521.084s">[Callahan]</a>: Those genuinely are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6524.971s">[Callahan]</a>: not the greatest way to elect people, not necessarily the best representation of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6533.474s">[Callahan]</a>: They also lead to long incumbencies because it is far more difficult to oust an incumbent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6546.558s">[Callahan]</a>: I was very curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6548.219s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that in Massachusetts, we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6552.715s">[Callahan]</a>: We are a little bit of an outlier currently, especially with seven at large, but also in terms of the number of city councilors that we have for the size of our population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6564.802s">[Callahan]</a>: And I was really curious to look outside of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6569.325s">[Callahan]</a>: And if I could share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6582.077s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6583.418s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry that this is so small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6586.661s">[Callahan]</a>: And this should only be, hang on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6593.406s">[Callahan]</a>: I only wanna share that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6594.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me see if I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6600.613s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the one I picked, but it didn't, oh, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6602.374s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6612.922s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, so what I did was I went ahead and I looked at other states and other cities, and I mean, I literally just went to Chattopiti, and I asked Chattopiti, please give me 10 cities in New England that are around 60,000 population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6635.668s">[Callahan]</a>: And I said, please give me 10 cities in the South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6637.829s">[Callahan]</a>: I said, please give me 10 cities in the West, 10 cities in the Midwest, and I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6643.05s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, you know, there was no picking of which cities these were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6647.633s">[Callahan]</a>: These are, I believe, a quite random sampling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6652.076s">[Callahan]</a>: And they're all, you know, somewhere around 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6655.378s">[Callahan]</a>: And I looked just to have an understanding of other states and other cities that aren't Massachusetts, and how many city councilors they have per population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6670.047s">[Callahan]</a>: So there's a range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6672.783s">[Callahan]</a>: I think population per city council ranges from about 4,000 to about 15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6679.347s">[Callahan]</a>: There's a lot of, you know, there's a big range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6684.469s">[Callahan]</a>: There's a large, there's wards or districts, and there's a lot of hybrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6690.312s">[Callahan]</a>: There are a few that are purely wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6693.474s">[Callahan]</a>: And what I thought was interesting is that at the number seven, and this has, I think it ended up with 48,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6701.589s">[Callahan]</a>: because there was one that was 99,000, I got rid of that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6705.572s">[Callahan]</a>: So there's 48 listed here and we just so happen in population per city councilor to rank 24th, which is exactly in the center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6715.839s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, this is a pretty random sampling of cities that are close to 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6722.084s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just wanted to sort of provide that as what I think is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6727.621s">[Callahan]</a>: know, looking, it includes some in Massachusetts as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6732.245s">[Callahan]</a>: And Massachusetts does tend to have far larger city councils per population than other states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6741.033s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe we want to be more like other cities, maybe we think that other states and cities in the country also understand how to do a democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6750.182s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6752.045s">[Callahan]</a>: have an opinion either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6753.246s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that Massachusetts is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6756.248s">[Callahan]</a>: The way we do things is necessarily better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6758.27s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think the way other states do it is necessarily better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6761.312s">[Callahan]</a>: But I just thought it was interesting to kind of take a look at a random sampling of cities across the country that have approximately our population and what their size of city council is and also what their sort of composition is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6774.662s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just wanted to provide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6775.523s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7970.535s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7972.596s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to note first that I independently also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7980.312s">[Callahan]</a>: came up with a thought of what Councilor Leming suggested, which was for the four districts plus five at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7986.115s">[Callahan]</a>: So I thought it was amusing that you independently came up with that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7989.637s">[Callahan]</a>: I also am fine with a larger city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7996.641s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I just wanted to say that I'm not on this committee, and I so appreciate the opportunity to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8005.526s">[Callahan]</a>: I will not be able to vote today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8007.007s">[Callahan]</a>: I do actually have another appointment, and so I will be leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8011.971s">[Callahan]</a>: But thank you all so much for your incredibly thoughtful comments and proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8023.241s">[Callahan]</a>: I, for one, genuinely believe that everyone here is doing their absolute best to come up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8034.242s">[Callahan]</a>: what is going to be the best for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8038.544s">[Callahan]</a>: Not slightly better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8041.085s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are, I think we should listen to what councilors say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8046.948s">[Callahan]</a>: We should take what they say as what they mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8051.031s">[Callahan]</a>: And I certainly, when I do have an opportunity to vote in the city council meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8058.8s">[Callahan]</a>: I will be voting for the thing that I believe is the best possible charter that we can have for the best representation in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8067.883s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1577.742s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1578.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1579.103s">[Callahan]</a>: Great to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1580.623s">[Callahan]</a>: I am curious, just because of the information I know about our roads, that once they get past a certain deterioration rate, then they become a lot more expensive to repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1591.209s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm curious about tennis courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1594.15s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there that kind of a lifecycle where they should be repaired within a certain number of years, and then it becomes more expensive, only noticing that this is the most expensive item on our list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1604.236s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm curious if that's something that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1606.797s">[Callahan]</a>: could pay less for in the future by repairing them earlier?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1693.403s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3575.567s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much for the work that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3576.768s">[Callahan]</a>: It's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3578.429s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted a quick, for the record, for folks listening, can you let us know what 100% of AMI is in Bedford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3587.777s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3588.397s">[Callahan]</a>: I know it's area median.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3589.318s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just going to look it up, and then I was like, maybe the public should know, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3592.02s">[Callahan]</a>: But off the top of your head, nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3610.096s">[Callahan]</a>: I was looking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3610.576s">[Callahan]</a>: I didn't find it instantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3611.737s">[Callahan]</a>: So, We don't have to stop the meeting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3621.364s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just, I just thought it'd be interesting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3623.245s">[Callahan]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3623.825s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1.863s">[Callahan]</a>: Test 1-2, test 1-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=89.03s">[Callahan]</a>: We're ready to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=90.731s">[Callahan]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=91.011s">[Callahan]</a>: Welcome to the Public Works and Facilities Committee of January 21st, 2025, taking place at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=97.935s">[Callahan]</a>: in the City Council Chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=100.096s">[Callahan]</a>: Today, we will cover two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=102.237s">[Callahan]</a>: One is paper number 24-492, Resolution to Receive an Update on Roads, and the other one is 24-493, Resolution to Establish a Volunteer Tree Planting Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=112.643s">[Callahan]</a>: Before we go on, Mr. Clerk, would you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=131.002s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=133.985s">[Callahan]</a>: Then we might as well move on to our first paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=138.288s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is the resolution to receive an update on the roads, whereas it has been more than six months since the city council was last updated on our roads, and whereas during the election of November 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=148.775s">[Callahan]</a>: The voters of Medford considered a budget override provision in Question 7 providing funds for, among other purposes, quote, fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works, $500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, unquote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=166.454s">[Callahan]</a>: and that ballot question was successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=168.536s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite engineer Owen Wartella and DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting that is today to talk about the state of the roads and the plan moving forward, given the outcome of the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=184.708s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much to Commissioner McGibbon and Engineer Wartella for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=190.275s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to go ahead and pass the floor to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=193.819s">[Callahan]</a>: And if you can give us an update on the roads, especially given the new budget, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=441.336s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me see if there are any questions from the city council members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=449.56s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=451.061s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you help me with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=464.73s">[Callahan]</a>: on the left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=466.34s">[Callahan]</a>: We're trying to click the green one and nothing's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=688.397s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I don't actually have one other question before we go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1765.553s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1767.394s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to put in one last comment just because I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1773.208s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, a lot of this, we do this for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1776.189s">[Callahan]</a>: We do this not just for us to understand because we're obviously involved in budget considerations, but we do this for people who are listening to be able to really understand what is happening with our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1787.35s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to put this in a little bit of context that when we did our first roads assessment in, am I correct that it was 2019?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1793.371s">[Callahan]</a>: 2021 was the first one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.452s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.572s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1796.972s">[Callahan]</a>: Then when we did the first roads assessment in 2021,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1802.691s">[Callahan]</a>: At by that time, we are roads already were quite degraded in that 49% of our roads were in the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1813.492s">[Callahan]</a>: category four and five of the five, one being the best and five being the worst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1819.395s">[Callahan]</a>: So we found ourselves, you guys are in a situation where you're trying to dig us out of a hole that has come from the past and from the fact that maybe they didn't have the information because there was no roads assessment, maybe utilities were not being kept track of and so they,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1842.245s">[Callahan]</a>: No one was preventing the degrading that they were doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1845.866s">[Callahan]</a>: And for who knows what other reason, not enough funding or whatever else, that we found ourselves at the first roads assessment in 2021 with roads that are quite degraded, and now trying to dig ourselves out when just to stay at the same level would cost $5 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1864.988s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you say that's relatively accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1870.373s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1870.974s">[Callahan]</a>: Five would be just able to begin improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1876.379s">[Callahan]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1876.539s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1877.039s">[Callahan]</a>: So just for people to understand sort of the context of where we are in terms of this roads update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1882.885s">[Callahan]</a>: So, wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1884.466s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1885.407s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1886.168s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me go to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1969.313s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1969.774s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just want to see if you have any last things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1971.776s">[Callahan]</a>: I know we do have another agenda item that I'm hoping to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1974.319s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there anything else you'd want to add about roads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1988.876s">[Callahan]</a>: Starts with a single step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1990.136s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1990.357s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1991.717s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we can, I would love to move on to 24-493, which is the resolution to establish a volunteer tree planting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2000.0s">[Callahan]</a>: Whereas Medford loses an estimated 500 or more trees each year and plants less than 250 trees each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2006.383s">[Callahan]</a>: And whereas the cost of planting city trees is primarily in the labor to plant the trees rather than the cost of the sapling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2012.585s">[Callahan]</a>: and whereas Medford only has one full-time staff member dedicated to our trees, the tree warden, and whereas Medford currently contracts out for tree planting, which is more expensive than planting with an in-house crew, and whereas trees are a vital part of fighting climate change, help cool buildings and streets in summer, and add to the beauty of our city, and whereas Medford has many residents who want to volunteer to plant city trees, therefore, be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting, that is today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2040.4s">[Callahan]</a>: to begin discussing the possibility of allowing Medford residents to volunteer to help plant city trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2047.222s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a project near and dear to my heart that I talked about a lot as I was campaigning a year ago last summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2056.465s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would love to just open the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2061.647s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate Commissioner McIvern that you are open to discussing this possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2068.544s">[Callahan]</a>: There are other cities in Massachusetts that do allow residents to help volunteer to help plant city trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2078.247s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would love to hear your thoughts about whether this is a project that we could start looking into here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2085.769s">[Callahan]</a>: I know a lot of residents who are actually excited to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2088.45s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you can give us a little bit of sort of your opening thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2145.122s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2145.943s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you tell me a few, I have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2150.025s">[Callahan]</a>: What season is the best for tree planting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2176.002s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2178.104s">[Callahan]</a>: So a couple other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2184.207s">[Callahan]</a>: How comfortable would you feel with a volunteer, volunteer coordinator, or do we need to wait for a budget item to come and put a halftime person in the budget before you would feel comfortable with a position like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2232.054s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me go ahead and go to councilors for any questions or comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2236.698s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2442.204s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2442.685s">[Callahan]</a>: A couple other questions, if you've thought a little bit about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2449.031s">[Callahan]</a>: Aside from a volunteer coordinator, do you see any kind of structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2451.573s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, how would this fit in with the tree warden or with anything else in the DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2455.938s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, what would you imagine to be like a structurally, how would it work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2507.676s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2512.349s">[Callahan]</a>: Any other, I can think of a bunch of next steps that I will, by the way, I have talked to Chief Medford about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2519.096s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I think I have some other next steps for me personally that I want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2522.639s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you see other next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2525.522s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I'm thinking like a pilot, like we get something in the budget and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2532.297s">[Callahan]</a>: figure out like a place where we could do a pilot project where we can do one or two tree plantings in a particular neighborhood and you know work through the warden and the volunteer coordinator and really have a first project to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2545.985s">[Callahan]</a>: Just curious if you see sort of other sort of next steps that we would do in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2624.347s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2625.927s">[Callahan]</a>: Are there any other questions either from councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2628.508s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, from councillors first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2633.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Are there any questions from the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2641.031s">[Callahan]</a>: I see one and I don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2648.173s">[Callahan]</a>: Amanda Bowe, we have asked you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2715.748s">[Callahan]</a>: That is so exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2717.571s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2718.473s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate you bringing that to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2720.537s">[Callahan]</a>: You're going to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2723.442s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2730.389s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2730.95s">[Callahan]</a>: On that note, I believe we are at the end of this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2736.095s">[Callahan]</a>: I so again, super appreciate that you're open to the idea, really looking forward to moving this forward either through the administration with a part time volunteer coordinator or with a nonprofit, but potentially working with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2750.531s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, the Mr. Graber Water Association or some other nonprofit, and of course with Trees Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2755.795s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much, Trees Medford, for the work that you have done in previous years on this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2761.959s">[Callahan]</a>: And with that being said, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2778.209s">[Callahan]</a>: with a motion to adjourn from Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2781.291s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2785.914s">[Callahan]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2791.818s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2794.32s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, do we need to call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2796.001s">[Callahan]</a>: We don't need to call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2797.302s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2798.102s">[Callahan]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2798.782s">[Callahan]</a>: And all opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2799.903s">[Callahan]</a>: We have three in favor, one opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2804.066s">[Callahan]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2805.027s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2742.186s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2743.167s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I'll say that given the garbled nature of the Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2747.008s">[Callahan]</a>: call and the complicated nature of the request, I definitely need that reread because I did not understand what that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2755.552s">[Callahan]</a>: I had a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2757.053s">[Callahan]</a>: Number one, I'm really excited about the idea of historic conversions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2760.555s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's wonderful, like not changing the exterior of the building but allowing for it to become maybe, you know, a five-bedroom becomes a two-bedroom and a three-bedroom is such a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2772.285s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I wanted to ask a little bit about the NR2 and NR3 areas that used to be single-family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2780.028s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm specifically thinking about, as I look at the map, like Lawrence Estates and those parts of West Medford that were single-family, single-family one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2791.492s">[Callahan]</a>: And curious, because you did mention that you're trying to get it to reflect what's currently there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2798.394s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you think that in those areas, the two-unit and three-unit allowance under these new zoning neighborhoods, is that reflective or is that going to be a significant change in those two areas, the Lawrence Estates and the West Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3062.909s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, no, mostly I was kind of, what I was looking at, and thanks for pointing out this particular map, because now I can actually see it for myself and zoom in on it, but like in that Lawrence Estates especially, it really does look like it's currently mostly single family, and we are, you know, upping it by one and two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3084.62s">[Callahan]</a>: potentially like, you know, one and two levels more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3089.043s">[Callahan]</a>: So, just, I just wanted to know how much change was suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3096.287s">[Callahan]</a>: I had a question that is perhaps a silly one, but I was curious when I look at the, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3103.243s">[Callahan]</a>: sort of diagram, the very last page that has the two and a half stories and the three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3108.246s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know that I see that architecture all over the place and like the two and a half story looks, you know, a certain way and the three story looks very like blocky and cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3119.815s">[Callahan]</a>: how much does it, that half story matter to like not blocking people's view or not blocking people's sunlight or not blocking other things because like as an architectural piece and for the amount of extra space people get in their homes, like it, I don't know, to me seems like that might be nicer actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3140.165s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm just like, this is a, I'm totally not an architecture person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3143.507s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm just curious more than anything, not making a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3321.613s">[Callahan]</a>: Does a half story, does a two and a half or three and a half limit encourage pitched roofs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3648.956s">[Callahan]</a>: What mic number are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3652.659s">[Callahan]</a>: Go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3653.119s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3654.44s">[Callahan]</a>: So what I heard Zach say is the opposite of what I wrote down that you read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3660.265s">[Callahan]</a>: So my understanding is that now the lightest yellow and the northern parts of Lawrence Estates and the middle part of West Medford would all include two-unit dwellings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3671.274s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I heard, Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3672.555s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I heard in the rereading of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3676.482s">[Callahan]</a>: thing and I am concerned because I think that's I'm not really comfortable if that's what we're doing is making every like two unit everywhere like that's I believe president bears please step in and correct me I think it's the opposite I think it's that yeah I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that this is an increment too far and each shade should go down one increment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3697.423s">[Callahan]</a>: That is, I feel much more comfortable about that, but I'm a little concerned about the wording because to me, the wording said the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3725.267s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3726.168s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm much more comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3840.12s">[Callahan]</a>: We got a lively debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3841.001s">[Callahan]</a>: This is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3842.461s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am in favor of sex change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3845.683s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'll just let you know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3848.104s">[Callahan]</a>: I think, like, I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are allowing for historic conversions and ADUs by right throughout what is currently considered single family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3861.871s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, that is enough change in those areas that I do not feel like we need to move further than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3868.875s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3870.157s">[Callahan]</a>: we will get pushback from the community is my concern that, you know, that's a little bit like those areas of Lawrence Estates and West Medford that already that is, I think, excellent and just the right amount of change that we're going to allow that doesn't really change a character of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3890.795s">[Callahan]</a>: I think once we're allowing two units, that for me, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3898.82s">[Callahan]</a>: belongs more in the areas that were on this new map considered neighborhood residential three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3911.13s">[Callahan]</a>: And that also will be a change for much of those places, but I'm comfortable with that level of change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3917.235s">[Callahan]</a>: So I feel quite good, and I think better than the current<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3923.499s">[Callahan]</a>: suggestion, given that I do understand that because of some of the existing housing that is there, because you guys plotted this very carefully, that the boundaries are going to adjust a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3935.101s">[Callahan]</a>: But to me, this feels more comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3937.882s">[Callahan]</a>: And it also does mean, because of the ADUs and the historic conversions by right, that we are allowing more housing throughout the city, but just in a way that I think feels more comfortable to the residents of the single-family, current single-family one areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4141.177s">[Callahan]</a>: Three out of five is a quorum, isn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2425.472s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2426.592s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate all the information you provided for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2429.353s">[Callahan]</a>: This is enough information that I all the information that I need to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2433.134s">[Callahan]</a>: I very much appreciate a number of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2435.575s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, that you've been looking into state and federal grants to make sure that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2441.357s">[Callahan]</a>: get as much as we can from other sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2444.46s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate the balancing that you're trying to do between our goals, like, for example, our clinicals, but also with our limited budget and really trying to do the best that we can there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2456.011s">[Callahan]</a>: And most of all, this, I think, is an example, and I feel like this has been true<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2464.398s">[Callahan]</a>: Most of the times that I've interacted with this administration is that that you really are understanding that there are times when delaying a project actually leads to it costing far, far more than it would have if we had just fixed it in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2482.347s">[Callahan]</a>: So I very much appreciate that level of financial responsibility where you're saying, no, we do need to fix this now, because if we don't, then it will be more expensive for the city in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2493.131s">[Callahan]</a>: So I very much appreciate those things and all the information you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2496.833s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2095.523s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2096.744s">[Callahan]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2097.945s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, I appreciate the time of these parents, you know, having heard a lot of their stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2104.531s">[Callahan]</a>: And as you will all hear today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2106.312s">[Callahan]</a>: I think, you know, it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2111.136s">[Callahan]</a>: They are in a situation of really needing to be supported and needing to be supported in their own city and not to have to drive like long distances to get to somewhere that they can get the support they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2124.021s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited to work with them as parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2127.862s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope also that we can find someone in the community who is not one of these parents to like help us to really sort of move forward on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2137.425s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited to work with the administration, and to really be creative in thinking about the ways that we can support them as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2149.255s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, we've been in these discussions so we've been in this administration already with these discussions so we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2155.5s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm really excited to hear from them, and excited to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2160.004s">[Callahan]</a>: get them what they need quickly and in the long term, making sure that that's something that is going to be, you know, a long term thing in the city of Medford that they can count on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2173.89s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4663.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4664.269s">[Callahan]</a>: If anyone is curious about more information on this project, we just had a meeting at six o'clock that you can find online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4672.172s">[Callahan]</a>: And, and they provided a ton of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4675.974s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think we all feel like quite informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4680.076s">[Callahan]</a>: including all of the different state and federal grants that they've been looking into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4683.577s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate all the planning that has gone into this, the amount that they are balancing our goals, including things like climate goals and everything else with our limited budget and our desire to make sure that we are, you know, spending what we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4701.181s">[Callahan]</a>: need to spend in the most financially responsible way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4704.363s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate what Councilor Tseng just said, which is that often if you wait and defer projects, it in fact costs the city far more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4713.609s">[Callahan]</a>: So I appreciate that they are trying to look to the future and do these repairs now rather than waiting any longer and having it be more costly in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4723.835s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will be voting yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4724.916s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5542.083s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5543.045s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a quick point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5544.406s">[Callahan]</a>: It is my understanding that the chief of police was invited to participate in the discussion around these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5549.814s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5582.959s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13992.643s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13993.403s">[Callahan]</a>: I was actually just hoping you could read back the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13999.065s">[Callahan]</a>: I was hoping to write an amendment while other people were speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14002.227s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14002.487s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14738.58s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14738.921s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14739.481s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to see if I could make a friendly amendment to the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14743.181s">[Callahan]</a>: I have sent the amendment to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14745.822s">[Callahan]</a>: The amendment is that we request that the administration work with the building department and other public safety departments to alleviate concerns about after hours building inspector availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14759.761s">[Callahan]</a>: This really is the job of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14763.222s">[Callahan]</a>: And I appreciate that we've had quite a public forum here for folks to speak and really for us to understand what these issues are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14775.146s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think the appropriate move here is to both get information and also to encourage the administration to make sure that these issues are covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15389.713s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15391.494s">[Callahan]</a>: I was very sad that the porch closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15393.976s">[Callahan]</a>: I went there many times and I would love to hear your 30 second elevator pitch for your vision for what you're creating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15912.489s">[Callahan]</a>: Many other cities do have a hard stop in their rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15915.552s">[Callahan]</a>: So they will have, as Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins mentioned, that they will have something in their rules that says at X time, everything is tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=353.153s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=699.909s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=700.289s">[Callahan]</a>: I also just wanted to say that very few cities do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=703.591s">[Callahan]</a>: Very few cities have a document where you can actually see what are the goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=708.695s">[Callahan]</a>: What is the, not just a pure value statement vision, but what are the actual policies that we're trying to pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=715.72s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to thank whoever came up with this idea, because I think it's really brilliant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=720.243s">[Callahan]</a>: And to be able to have it visible to the public, and then we go over it in public meetings, I think is crucial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=726.367s">[Callahan]</a>: And like you said, great for transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=727.988s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you to everyone who put it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1275.262s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I said they just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1277.683s">[Callahan]</a>: What is the appropriate next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1279.203s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think it's a huge rush, but I would love to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1283.344s">[Callahan]</a>: So it sounds like you're going to check in with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1286.084s">[Callahan]</a>: Just was curious about what the next step is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1338.684s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, and it sounds like you're willing to at least just ping them and see what the update is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1748.072s">[Callahan]</a>: because I have not gotten the briefing that you have from the assessor, I am very curious and I just want to make sure that for myself I also agree that it is, you know, if I, like to me, if I think that it might be something that might help some folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1764.489s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm just curious, is the assessor the right person to talk to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1768.434s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1769.09s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, how can I understand a little bit more about it just to kind of get my own sense of what it is that that state law is in fact offering to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1799.069s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be lovely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1800.75s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2037.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2039.495s">[Callahan]</a>: So pardon me if I forgot I was up late last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2043.096s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just wanted to ask, I think the mayor was going to provide us with a little bit more of a long-term capital spending plan now that we have the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2054.159s">[Callahan]</a>: Did that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2055.159s">[Callahan]</a>: Are we still waiting for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2057.54s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that something we expect in that administrative finance committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2074.724s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2356.857s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2357.978s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm absolutely in favor of us checking in and making sure that that money is spent well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2362.72s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2365.785s">[Callahan]</a>: Clearly, the mayor and the administration knew that there was a possibility that the overrides would pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2371.209s">[Callahan]</a>: They knew about this 1.75 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2372.751s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sure that they had a plan for how to spend that money in case those got passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2380.697s">[Callahan]</a>: But again, I appreciate it, and I think we should look into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2383.659s">[Callahan]</a>: But I doubt very much that we lost that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3238.373s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3238.993s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a good reminder for some of the things that I said I would work on that I should maybe move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3243.716s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3246.718s">[Callahan]</a>: I also wanted to ask, I'm going to guess because it wasn't on this list at the beginning of the year, but we did discuss getting, and we also got a little bit more information from the assessors on the possibility of a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3261.527s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm just curious what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3264.309s">[Callahan]</a>: what committee that would be discussed in, if we decide to, you know, to have a discussion around the information that's provided?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3509.846s">[Callahan]</a>: I welcome anyone who has traffic related or roads related or sidewalk related, anything to ask that it go into the public works and facilities committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3521.17s">[Callahan]</a>: I would be happy to take those in my committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3522.59s">[Callahan]</a>: So if that seems like the appropriate place, then I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4105.205s">[Callahan]</a>: The fat cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4106.045s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, the fat rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4112.688s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4113.989s">[Callahan]</a>: So I know that one thing that is a top topic for people in our city to talk about and to complain about is roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4124.618s">[Callahan]</a>: For perfectly good reason, we got into a hole because the roads and sidewalks were not properly updated for many, many, many, many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4134.767s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are doing our best as a city to dig ourselves out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4138.67s">[Callahan]</a>: I think my plan, so we had one, we had the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4141.462s">[Callahan]</a>: DBW commissioner, as well as the lead engineer, come to a meeting in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4145.985s">[Callahan]</a>: They will be coming to another meeting, which I thought was going to be in December, but it turns out it's going to be in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4151.85s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think my goal is to have them come in twice a year, just to give updates to the public, have a public meeting with them there, being able to report, see how we're doing in terms of getting our roads back from the brink and really getting us on that uptake where every year our average road<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4171.184s">[Callahan]</a>: rating is getting better instead of getting worse, which has been happening for a long time in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4177.706s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's kind of my plan on that one, is to have them come in a couple of times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4180.867s">[Callahan]</a>: I know Councilor Bears has also asked for some information from our building commissioner and some others on city facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4190.01s">[Callahan]</a>: So I will check in with President Bears about that, and perhaps we can have one where we have an update<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4197.052s">[Callahan]</a>: on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4199.453s">[Callahan]</a>: We have the public restrooms and parks and squares that has come into our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4203.614s">[Callahan]</a>: We're working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4206.715s">[Callahan]</a>: Lead ordinance, clearly with the notifications that came out from the city about lead pipes, I think it is more on people's minds than it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4214.898s">[Callahan]</a>: It is something that has always been important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4218.739s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I hope that in the new year, we do start working on this lead ordinance, which we have not yet given a paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4227.523s">[Callahan]</a>: There is also a home rule petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4233.145s">[Callahan]</a>: Vice President Collins, do you want to give us a tiny update on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4265.551s">[Callahan]</a>: it will likely go on the back burner when we discuss these projects at a committee meeting in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4271.718s">[Callahan]</a>: Public utility accountability, I will say when I have spoken to staff, they are actually doing a really excellent job compared to prior years and prior administrations on holding our public utilities accountable and forcing them to do road repair and sidewalk repair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4289.056s">[Callahan]</a>: as much as we are legally allowed to force them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4292.962s">[Callahan]</a>: So, we can maybe also get an update on that from the DPW commissioner when they when they come into our committee to talk about roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4304.041s">[Callahan]</a>: The Tree Planting Volunteer Network is something that I talked about a lot on the campaign trail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4309.505s">[Callahan]</a>: It's probably my absolute favorite policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4311.407s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4312.467s">[Callahan]</a>: And at our next public works meeting in January, the public works commissioner will be, sorry, DPW commissioner will be having our first discussion about how to implement this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4327.738s">[Callahan]</a>: This is basically allowing residents, because most of the cost of planting trees in the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4332.943s">[Callahan]</a>: replacing, we lose far more trees than we replace, so we're losing trees every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4340.482s">[Callahan]</a>: And for sure, the major cost of that is labor and not the price of the tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4346.923s">[Callahan]</a>: So the goal is to allow residents to volunteer, to work together with training, with appropriate trees, with the appropriate depth, doing it all the right way, but to allow residents to plant city trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4364.148s">[Callahan]</a>: So it does sound like that is something that the administration is amenable to, and I'm really looking forward to our first conversation about that in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4373.676s">[Callahan]</a>: And aside from that, we are just, you know, reviewing other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4378.42s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm looking forward to 2025 and us getting some of those things done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4382.804s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4772.704s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just going to say it's been a pleasure to be working with you all in this first year, my first year of being an elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4779.27s">[Callahan]</a>: I appreciate all the support that everyone has given in just understanding how things work and whom to talk to for information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4787.356s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really appreciate the way that we've been working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4790.839s">[Callahan]</a>: Also appreciate the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4792.02s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Clerk, for all the work that you do for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4796.944s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, and thanks to everyone who is tuning in, whether it's live or after the fact to any city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4805.033s">[Callahan]</a>: We appreciate your participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4807.095s">[Callahan]</a>: We appreciate you keeping up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4809.357s">[Callahan]</a>: Appreciate the emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4810.298s">[Callahan]</a>: We appreciate all the communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4811.82s">[Callahan]</a>: And please do reach out and let us know what we can do for you in the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Callahan]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1999.701s">[Callahan]</a>: Steal my thunder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2000.621s">[Callahan]</a>: I basically was going to see if you had, like, how short is your short version of your presentation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2004.823s">[Callahan]</a>: And if there's something you can give that's five minutes or less that can really give us an overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2009.965s">[Callahan]</a>: And as well, if you can also give us a little bit of an understanding of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2016.669s">[Callahan]</a>: exactly how important the timing is and whether getting something, you know, obviously this is a process, it would not be approved tonight, it has three readings, whether us bringing it forward tonight is crucial to the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2030.463s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4133.615s">[Callahan]</a>: Real quick, this was something that I have dealt with a lot being a renter, living in a lot of different houses, all of which I led when my child was under six years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4143.101s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do think that it's crucially important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4147.364s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm very excited that Medford is incentivizing people and giving people this opportunity to get those fixed and providing a little bit of help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4154.708s">[Callahan]</a>: I also understand that this is simply<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4157.85s">[Callahan]</a>: putting it in place so that it can be used by the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4162.133s">[Callahan]</a>: Obviously, that'll depend on how many applications come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4164.575s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm very happy to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5177.962s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually would make a motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5179.903s">[Callahan]</a>: I would sever it into five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5181.203s">[Callahan]</a>: Perhaps we can do that after public discussion or whatever before or after either one is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5186.504s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think there's one that's about the essentially lines two and four, which are the cost of terminating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5194.246s">[Callahan]</a>: Then the one in the middle, that line three,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5198.207s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh inviting all communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5199.708s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's a a separate one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5202.209s">[Callahan]</a>: Um there's a question of the bond rating is a third.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5205.651s">[Callahan]</a>: The question of the private investigators is the fourth and the question of the drug testing is a fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5210.313s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be my suggestion to sever it into those five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6828.433s">[Callahan]</a>: comment was actually from earlier just to explain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6831.915s">[Callahan]</a>: To the person who's asking us to respond that like actually, I think I at least for one Councilor was really hoping to hear from the public first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6839.539s">[Callahan]</a>: I did not want to interrupt and put in my own comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6842.441s">[Callahan]</a>: I really wanted to hear a little bit more about what people had gone through and experienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6846.703s">[Callahan]</a>: That was why I was not responding to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6849.264s">[Callahan]</a>: I also do hope that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6853.386s">[Callahan]</a>: Are we going to sever before we discuss each one or are we going to sever at the very last second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6858.968s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it might be easier to sever and then discuss each piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7737.067s">[Callahan]</a>: My mic is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7738.027s">[Callahan]</a>: Does that mean I am allowed to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7745.172s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just say that I, I think rule 21 is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7749.25s">[Callahan]</a>: very unhealthy for us to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7752.132s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that we should use it incredibly sparingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7755.634s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that a financial paper is in fact one that moves funding, and we are not doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7760.137s">[Callahan]</a>: This does not actually move any funding anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7763.319s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, classifying this as a finance paper with regards to Rule 21 really makes Rule 21 far more broad than I am comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7774.405s">[Callahan]</a>: I did not think that was what, like, I don't read rule 21 as saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7779.888s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, I think a ton of people have come here to hear our thoughts on this and to hear us make, you know, either move this forward or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7787.793s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think it is, it's not really the best, I think, for anyone if we do not allow this discussion to have a conclusion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7964.88s">[Callahan]</a>: It's her motion to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7965.96s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you please repeat exactly how you want to sever it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8086.642s">[Callahan]</a>: The reason I had split it into five was because the first and third sentences, their cost associated with terminating school superintendent's contract and anticipated costs of superintendent search committee and interim appointment, those to me seem to go together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8101.951s">[Callahan]</a>: Asking for any and all communications, corresponding meeting minutes, I may have a very different opinion of that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8108.054s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8110.435s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8820.785s">[Callahan]</a>: I would be in favor of something that was not exactly this, but that requested from the administration to understand what is our policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8830.471s">[Callahan]</a>: What is the reason which we are doing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8832.212s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, for me, both of these last two paragraphs are, I will say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8839.184s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope we have a really good reason if we are doing either of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8844.867s">[Callahan]</a>: I looked a little bit into different state laws, in different states, different state laws on drug testing, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8856.632s">[Callahan]</a>: And it has to be only under certain circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8863.436s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think for me, I really want to have an explanation of what our policy is as a city for both of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8874.289s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we are doing either of these, what the reasoning is behind it, I don't think that I am completely ready to vote yes on this before I have more information, a flat-out cease and desist, although it does, like, I mean, hearing the language, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8896.714s">[Callahan]</a>: may seem attractive, but before I have more information, I'm not willing to vote yes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8900.918s">[Callahan]</a>: I would vote yes if this were amended to say we want to know a full policy, we want to understand, you know, when this is used, and then the cost as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8936.186s">[Callahan]</a>: let me do my best to request that the city administration provide its policy regarding the use of private investigators with regards to any city all any or all its city employees and then I'm okay with the second sentence be it further resolved that the city administration report back with the identified line items in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.175s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9054.955s">[Callahan]</a>: If I may, I have to say, I am overall, whenever I have looked into specific questions, things like how much free cash we get at the end of the budget year, and whether that is something that is viewed by the state of Massachusetts, by bond agencies, et cetera, as is that something positive or negative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9080.942s">[Callahan]</a>: There are other things that I have looked into that the city has done that have been questions about what the city is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9086.725s">[Callahan]</a>: And when I've looked into very specific things like those, I am usually, I find that what, or for example, the other one is like creating capital stabilization funds, these sorts of things, I have found that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9105.928s">[Callahan]</a>: the city administration is actually doing things that are considered, in those two cases, considered best practice by the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9116.018s">[Callahan]</a>: And that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9123.135s">[Callahan]</a>: I, if, if we were a city council where I genuinely believed that the mayor or the administration were doing something that I disagreed with, even if it were the purview of the mayor, I, as a city Councilor, I would feel comfortable making a motion that says the city council does not agree with X, Y, Z practice if that were the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9146.014s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so I just want to make it clear that I don't think that we as a city council are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9151.918s">[Callahan]</a>: in any way trapped against saying what we believe our opinion of what the administration should be doing is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9158.602s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that we can say the same thing to Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9160.423s">[Callahan]</a>: We can't control Tufts, but we sure can say we wish Tufts were doing something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9164.606s">[Callahan]</a>: We would like Tufts to do something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9166.047s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we can say that to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9169.769s">[Callahan]</a>: So a slight disagreement, I think, with my fellow Councilor, or maybe not, but if I was understanding you correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9177.293s">[Callahan]</a>: I just think I don't have the information, and I really want to have a lot more information before I make any kind of decision on something that would say something so strongly worded as that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9192.616s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm happy that I think we're going to get a wording change, and we'll be able to get a little more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9328.42s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually, to be honest, I would like to know what our drug policy testing is for all city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9370.741s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think that the reasons for these particular tests, I would be interested in that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9386.021s">[Callahan]</a>: I honestly I think that we might because of the reading that I did on drug testing in different states in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9395.806s">[Callahan]</a>: There are certain, there are only certain times that it can be done, it is not at the whim of the mayor or anyone else in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9403.809s">[Callahan]</a>: there, you know, it falls into certain categories where it is legal and then other categories where it is not legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9409.714s">[Callahan]</a>: So I imagine that we will, we will get an answer that at least will fall into like some vague category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9415.418s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would be happy with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9601.856s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanna have some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9604.758s">[Callahan]</a>: Um the requested meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9607.28s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I'm assuming this is a meeting between the administration and the fire department that you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9614.326s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, can you be a little bit more clear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9639.115s">[Callahan]</a>: So you're asking that the meeting with the council also include the fire chief and the union leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9649.923s">[Callahan]</a>: But that if there needs to be an executive session, we would have that without those folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10387.976s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10389.137s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10390.557s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see where the zoning board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10392.718s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm on page six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10401.323s">[Callahan]</a>: They're not in the pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10403.764s">[Callahan]</a>: My computer is dead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10404.725s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10417.833s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I see page six, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10419.434s">[Callahan]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10877.465s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10878.525s">[Callahan]</a>: The one change I would additionally like to make is I am hoping, I know that we have not had a chance yet to discuss co-living, which as far as I understand it is really just people who are not related to each other living, renting an apartment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10893.753s">[Callahan]</a>: And I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the fact that that is disallowed in certain sections of MSTICAV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10899.355s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm hoping that we can just remove that definition and everywhere it appears for this particular approval tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10906.217s">[Callahan]</a>: And that'll give us time to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10908.878s">[Callahan]</a>: And we can always add that definition later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10910.439s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think it's going to delay anything or be problematic to simply remove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10914.9s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'd love to ask you your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10916.581s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you think that we could just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11918.615s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11919.215s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to say how much I appreciated the comment about our values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11922.957s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's always really important to discuss our values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11926.699s">[Callahan]</a>: And I agree that in the comprehensive plan, it really is sort of filled with that kind of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11932.482s">[Callahan]</a>: And you can read about what people in the community, what values other folks who live here wanted to bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11938.746s">[Callahan]</a>: I know for myself, one of my highest values is a sense of community and vibrancy and people being able to walk to a place that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11948.271s">[Callahan]</a>: meet with their neighbors and really love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11950.573s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's something I'm always thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11952.354s">[Callahan]</a>: I know for Mystic Ave, it really is not a place that people just love to walk down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11959.92s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's something that we've really been trying to work on is to make Mystic Ave something that serves us as a community and as residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11970.409s">[Callahan]</a>: But another underlying thing that we understand that people want is there to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11977.034s">[Callahan]</a>: more new growth right so that new growth is both going to be commercial businesses moving in it's also going to be about new housing that brings in new revenue to the city they both bring in revenue to the city so I think those are among the many different things as well as well as you know we have these new green score that is going to bring more places which I think were mentioned about like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12000.836s">[Callahan]</a>: where young and old people can, you know, spend time together where there's trees, where there's benches to sit on and places to, you know, to chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12008.741s">[Callahan]</a>: We're going to be incentivizing that from developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12011.182s">[Callahan]</a>: So these are all things that I think we have, we have brought forward as, as values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12016.566s">[Callahan]</a>: Each of us individually has values, but we also have some values that came out of the comprehensive plan that we are trying to make happen through the zoning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12024.671s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much for asking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13837.287s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I also not inclined to agree with any sort of waiving of three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13841.272s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the three readings are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13842.613s">[Callahan]</a>: Also, there were a lot of changes that just came in recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13845.176s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think, you know, I'm comfortable passing it for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13849.701s">[Callahan]</a>: It'll, you know, give me a chance to go through line by line every single change that was made, which I know was recommended by KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13857.433s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would be perfectly fine if we want to make an official request that in between our first reading and the third reading that we ask the police chief to come to a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13873.771s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think it's a different request when it's past first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13878.674s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we want to make a request that he show up to a committee meeting where we can discuss this and any reservations he has, I would be open to that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13896.844s">[Callahan]</a>: So we get it in between.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13902.048s">[Callahan]</a>: Ah, yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15747.716s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just going to suggest that maybe public comment at this meeting is not the best, like given that late hour and everything else is maybe not exactly when we want to be line by lining, you know, specific wording and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15761.943s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, the sponsors of the legislation working with, you know, like between now and third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15768.826s">[Callahan]</a>: Does that make sense that that might be a better way to make edits that may be doing it right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20675.023s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I would simply request that we do the same thing we did for the last thing, which is just remove strike table abuse regulations line eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=994.602s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=995.222s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, clearly this is going to be part of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=999.385s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sure that the language is pretty clear based on it being in the ordinance, but it does like on first reading external from the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1011.332s">[Callahan]</a>: there is this question of like, could it be used to say that residents who have their own video footage cannot use it in a criminal investigation for criminal proceeding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1022.977s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if it's like, that would be a question for a lawyer as to whether to specifically say any video footage or other data recorded or obtained by the city, by a city entity, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1036.384s">[Callahan]</a>: By a municipal entity, illegally or in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1040.1s">[Callahan]</a>: like just adding in to be very clear that we're only talking about video footage or other data obtained by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1234.879s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, just a super quick follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1236.843s">[Callahan]</a>: Was this previously part of the language that was sent to the legal before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1246.235s">[Callahan]</a>: Has this language passed through legal at least once, the stuff we're adding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1262.504s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that makes me feel more comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1264.105s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1264.325s">[Callahan]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1264.525s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2843.046s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2844.908s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, this ordinance seems very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2849.452s">[Callahan]</a>: I do appreciate all the work that has been put in, both by the former administration of police chief, as well as by the activists, by Councilor Tseng, and everyone else who was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2861.503s">[Callahan]</a>: The one thing I noticed as I read through it is it is very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2865.446s">[Callahan]</a>: It has a lot of details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2868.789s">[Callahan]</a>: things that as a person who is not an expert in police ICE integration, you know, I am not an expert in whether these things are boilerplate or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2883.359s">[Callahan]</a>: So my main question is just, and I would love to hear either from Councilor Tseng or from the ACLU, just about whether there are details in here that are Medford specific,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2899.731s">[Callahan]</a>: if these are pretty standard boilerplate that have been passed in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2904.514s">[Callahan]</a>: And then my final question would simply be to ask if this has been run by KP Law or if that's maybe our next step, just to see sort of what the next, in terms of the legalese, because I don't, being not super expert on this, there are lots and lots of details in here that I have not had a chance to research each one individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3421.999s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a super quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3424.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Did we this year maximize tax deferrals for seniors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3426.741s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that had already been done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3502.832s">[Callahan]</a>: Leave it as it's too confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3504.592s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, we don't need the super hyper detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3506.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3529.89s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like, let's just have like a footnote or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3599.901s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3601.242s">[Callahan]</a>: I am super happy if we want to do these because maybe these are even more interesting to some people than other things, but like the Bedford Donuts Cafe, the Demets Donuts, the Buns House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3614.287s">[Callahan]</a>: That might actually be really interesting to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3616.228s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought we were not including them, but I'm happy if we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3957.83s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just a little update, which is that the session that was supposed to be on the 7th got postponed, so that's going to be in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3965.254s">[Callahan]</a>: January the, do you remember the date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3968.415s">[Callahan]</a>: I can look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3969.676s">[Callahan]</a>: The 4th or something, and because we changed the date, weren't sure if you could make it, but we just want to make sure there's going to be a second City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3989.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, it is going to be the 4th at 1030, which is a Saturday, January 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3994.524s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you're available, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3996.005s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're not available, then chair Leming, if you don't mind helping us to make sure that somebody can make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4008.533s">[Callahan]</a>: And our community liaison, Stacey Moore, will be helping with outreach for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4012.594s">[Callahan]</a>: But it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4013.714s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the West Medford, we rescheduled because they misunderstood who was doing outreach for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4021.616s">[Callahan]</a>: And then once we were like, no, actually, it should be the venue that does outreach, and they said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4027.638s">[Callahan]</a>: We're going to do it in January, which gives us enough time to fill the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4031.7s">[Callahan]</a>: So we can expect there to be 20 or more people, which I think is going to be probably our largest so far, which will be very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=832.232s">[Callahan]</a>: mechanical problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=833.913s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=834.633s">[Callahan]</a>: I have a nephew who got into rowing in high school that all through college had changed his life, the sheer amount of time and dedication and, you know, muscles that you got to put in to be, to do rowing and teamwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=851.382s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's an incredible achievement for you to reach the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=854.984s">[Callahan]</a>: It is an incredible achievement for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=858.265s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm just so proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=859.806s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited for you to be here and thanks each and every one of you for all the work that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1321.101s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1322.322s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, it was an excellent time to see a game on Thanksgiving day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1327.066s">[Callahan]</a>: It was fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1328.107s">[Callahan]</a>: Really great to see some touchdowns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1330.268s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say as a total band geek that I was sad that I missed the marching band, but it was okay to see a wonderful winning game and an excellent game of football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1342.338s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1925.339s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1926.059s">[Callahan]</a>: As previously stated, I am a band geek.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1929.501s">[Callahan]</a>: I did marching band all through high school and college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1933.182s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the way that the marching band supports the football team and the sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1939.424s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, all of the work that people put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1941.285s">[Callahan]</a>: I really appreciate what Councilor Lazzaro said about kids being able to find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1946.747s">[Callahan]</a>: an activity and a community in which they feel they can really be themselves and express themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1952.871s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm so happy that we have not just a marching band, but an amazing marching band that is, you know, really striving and pushing itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1959.876s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm really excited and I congratulate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1963.238s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm super proud of what they bring to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1965.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3279.437s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3280.477s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the idea of having a catch all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3282.818s">[Callahan]</a>: I was going to ask that we specifically mention South Border Road because there are a number of residents on the upper part of governors who have for many years been complaining about the safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3292.361s">[Callahan]</a>: They're really concerned about their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3295.743s">[Callahan]</a>: You know lots of very fast traffic because of South Border Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3299.104s">[Callahan]</a>: So I hope we can leave some specific mention of things as well as having a catch all and I would love to have South Border Road specifically called out in this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3309.65s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=271.188s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, now it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=272.009s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2680.967s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2683.068s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, looking at this over the weekend with some of my volunteers like going like going through Google Maps and doing street view and looking very specifically like at an individual blocks like it's it's really impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2694.915s">[Callahan]</a>: What you've done to sort of preserve the neighborhood as well as really help us get to the point where we are able to develop in a way that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2704.44s">[Callahan]</a>: that just amplifies what we have and doesn't overdo it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2708.945s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really appreciate your attention to detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2711.288s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually have one very tiny question that is sort of not specifically related to Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2720.157s">[Callahan]</a>: I just, I'm curious because I noticed that there is co-living that is allowed, and I noticed this also in the Mystic Ave when it came through City Council to go to CDB, that co-living was disallowed on Mystic Ave, and here there's places where multiple dwelling is allowed and yet co-living is not allowed, like in Mixed Use 1 and Mixed Use 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2741.804s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, and perhaps this is a conversation I can have with someone, you know, maybe after the meeting, but, um, to, like, my understanding of co-living is that it is explicitly making it okay for people who are not related by family, um, to rent together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2760.339s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would be curious as to why we would have rental properties where that was disallowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2765.483s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so I, that's, maybe there's some nuance that I'm not understanding, um, and if,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2770.687s">[Callahan]</a>: talking about it after is more appropriate, that's totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2773.588s">[Callahan]</a>: I just was curious about that small detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2776.908s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2868.449s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2868.729s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2869.189s">[Callahan]</a>: I think talking afterwards is probably appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2871.891s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just say co-housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2873.411s">[Callahan]</a>: That is what I think co-housing is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2875.052s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think co-living, according to the definition that we wrote, is a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2878.073s">[Callahan]</a>: So let's talk about it after the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2880.294s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2881.074s">[Callahan]</a>: Sounds perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4142.145s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4142.665s">[Callahan]</a>: Just one incredibly short for anyone who heard us talk about co-living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4146.988s">[Callahan]</a>: I want people to be reassured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4148.809s">[Callahan]</a>: Co-living literally does not mean anything outside of a normal rental apartment being rented by people who are not related to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4155.754s">[Callahan]</a>: That's literally it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4156.574s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not congregate housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4158.055s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4159.376s">[Callahan]</a>: It's incredibly simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4160.637s">[Callahan]</a>: It's really adding nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4163.099s">[Callahan]</a>: And if you want me to explain to you why we are putting it in the zoning, I'm happy to explain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4168.482s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, why we're trying to differentiate between that and other kinds of housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4171.524s">[Callahan]</a>: But it's nothing changing, nothing new in that particular definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4176.067s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2719.759s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2723.721s">[Callahan]</a>: As everyone has already said, thank you so much for all your work so far this season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2727.662s">[Callahan]</a>: There's a lot going on for you, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2729.163s">[Callahan]</a>: And thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2731.897s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I have some numbers that are from housing Medford, and I just want to ask you if you think this is like close to accurate that we have approximately 47% single family homes, we have about 32% that have two to four units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2751.004s">[Callahan]</a>: We have about 2.5% that have five to nine units, about 2.5% that have 10 to 19 units, and 15% or so that have more than 20 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.066s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.526s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you explain this a little bit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2795.446s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I just see these columns are like 101, 102.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2797.867s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2860.54s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep, so what I'm looking for is percentage of the residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2863.742s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's hard to find that in this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2867.505s">[Callahan]</a>: What I'm trying to understand and what I have from Housing Medford, which I'm asking you if it's relatively close, is of our residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2874.069s">[Callahan]</a>: We're talking about a residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2876.991s">[Callahan]</a>: We need to compare residential to residential in this particular case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2882.094s">[Callahan]</a>: So that almost half of our residential, less than half is single families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2921.012s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, well, we have to vote today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2922.493s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm trying to kind of understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2924.314s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, so- For this discussion, rather than waiting until after we have the vote, I'd like to have that information for this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2936.658s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, maybe I can ask a couple other questions first, so we can have everything at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2942.663s">[Callahan]</a>: The way that I'm looking at it, and I understand the arguments for that if you're above the threshold, then your taxes will go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2952.93s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're below the threshold, probably your taxes will go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2957.99s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems to me that we have, it looks like, just under 50% that are single family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2966.132s">[Callahan]</a>: Those people are almost all certainly Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2970.473s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe 30% or so of our residential housing is between two and four units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2975.735s">[Callahan]</a>: Some of those are going to be Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2977.855s">[Callahan]</a>: Some of them are not going to be Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2980.896s">[Callahan]</a>: And then 20% is five units or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2984.177s">[Callahan]</a>: And those are almost certainly not owner-occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2989.207s">[Callahan]</a>: It sure seems to me that if we are looking at this from the sense of how can we benefit Medford residents and how can we especially benefit Medford residents who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3005.842s">[Callahan]</a>: Our working class are people who, you know, we have a really large cohort of people who moved here, when we were affordable, because this was where working class people could afford to buy, and those people most of them now are seniors, they're on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3025.134s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I'm thinking about this a lot because today is when we're supposed to be voting on this residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3030.099s">[Callahan]</a>: It is really our last chance to make a decision like this before the taxes from the Prop 2.5 override go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3043.03s">[Callahan]</a>: And so it really seems to me, and especially you have said that, what would happen is condos go down, single families, some would go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3054.318s">[Callahan]</a>: And then two and three families are the ones that are going to be starting to be the ones that are paying more, as well as the much larger properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3066.038s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, from my perspective, it really seems like we are now in that position, given the valuation that you, the sort of threshold of 982,000, that we really are gonna be benefiting almost all of our Medford residents, and certainly the ones who are most in need, by passing this residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3089.686s">[Callahan]</a>: And so my second question for you, because I understand that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3098.892s">[Callahan]</a>: it is considered that we would have had to do this earlier in the cycle in order for this to happen, but this was not on our agenda earlier in the cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3108.82s">[Callahan]</a>: It sure seems to me that if the administration believes that this could not be voted on now, and it needed to be voted on six months earlier, then the administration should have put this on our agenda six months earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3127.08s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm having trouble with the fact that we are supposed to take a vote tonight, and yet we're told we cannot vote in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.243s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm not blaming you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.944s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3136.504s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm looking at you, which I'm probably supposed to be looking at the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3139.227s">[Callahan]</a>: In no way do I think this is, I hope you don't hear me as if I am putting this on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3147.916s">[Callahan]</a>: I am not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3148.997s">[Callahan]</a>: But I do think that this is something that we are supposed to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3153.581s">[Callahan]</a>: It is our job to vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3155.443s">[Callahan]</a>: This is something I believe would benefit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3159.019s">[Callahan]</a>: almost all of the homeowners in Medford, except for those who own multifamilies and have some rental income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3167.642s">[Callahan]</a>: And I am feeling frustrated that we are now told that we are not allowed to vote in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3174.564s">[Callahan]</a>: So my question for you is, what would happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3179.449s">[Callahan]</a>: if we voted in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3181.27s">[Callahan]</a>: What would the city have to go through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3183.231s">[Callahan]</a>: How much pain and difficulty and money would it cost if we voted in favor for the city to actually get this stuff done on time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3193.496s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we hire enough consultants or full-time employees or whatever to make this thing happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3244.514s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you talk a little bit more about the overlay account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3372.23s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's not that we would have to get out of the overlay account, it's that we would have to have come here to this meeting with an option<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3379.975s">[Callahan]</a>: of a tax rate that would cover that, but is the question that you don't know what that tax rate is because you don't know how many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3397.122s">[Callahan]</a>: Because you haven't had the applications come in yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3403.805s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to understand, you couldn't, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3410.083s">[Callahan]</a>: yesterday or tonight and we post on the news tomorrow, just saying hypotheticals, you could not come up with that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3418.807s">[Callahan]</a>: You could not come up with the appropriate tax rate for us to have a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3453.479s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3454.9s">[Callahan]</a>: So how does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3456.58s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, let's say we wanna pass this as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3462.623s">[Callahan]</a>: When do you open up those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3464.124s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, since the city hasn't passed it yet, would the city have to then pass it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3469.164s">[Callahan]</a>: This is what you're saying, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3470.864s">[Callahan]</a>: The city would have to pass it in maybe June so that you can receive enough applications so that when it comes to tonight's vote in late November, you can set the rate, which you can't set because we don't have any applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3487.047s">[Callahan]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3541.606s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to make a motion that we ask KP Law exactly how we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3585.067s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you happen to have the other numbers for like two or three families or over five or anything like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3602.311s">[Callahan]</a>: We're apparently not gonna vote on it tonight anyway, so we can get another time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3609.872s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3648.871s">[Callahan]</a>: But that's parcels and not units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3653.032s">[Callahan]</a>: So units would be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3670.962s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I make another motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3698.657s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you for the assessor's office to provide us with the percentages and numbers of the single family, two family, three family, four family, five to nine, 10 to 19, over 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3717.0s">[Callahan]</a>: as well as valuations, average valuations, I think, for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.023s">[Callahan]</a>: That'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.903s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3723.163s">[Callahan]</a>: Or any other information that you think would be helpful for us to make a decision about a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3728.486s">[Callahan]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4280.657s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4282.058s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope it is not considered off topic to talk about the residential exemption that is on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4289.884s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm just curious, do we have good information on the multifamily housing and how many are owner-occupied?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4297.49s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that something that you could provide to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4316.799s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4318.98s">[Callahan]</a>: If it's something you can provide, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4321.321s">[Callahan]</a>: If you don't know, then yeah, I totally get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4323.842s">[Callahan]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4324.122s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4325.383s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=631.663s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=632.904s">[Callahan]</a>: So I want to give a little brief history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=635.625s">[Callahan]</a>: As President Bears mentioned, this was introduced by Councilor Knight in 2019, early in that year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=640.827s">[Callahan]</a>: It also went to the Energy and Environment Committee later that year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=647.39s">[Callahan]</a>: In 2021, it was looked at by the zoning subcommittee, and they allowed the trees Medford volunteer organization in Medford to draft and submit revised ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=660.578s">[Callahan]</a>: Later in 2021 that came back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=663.3s">[Callahan]</a>: And then in 2022, that ordinance was split into three parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=667.906s">[Callahan]</a>: And so those three parts are the ones that we'll be looking at today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=671.79s">[Callahan]</a>: One creates a tree committee for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=675.394s">[Callahan]</a>: One is about public shade trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=678.378s">[Callahan]</a>: And the third one is about private trees, trees on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=683.343s">[Callahan]</a>: So because it's been so long and because there have been a number of changes made, our goals today are really to sort of get everyone up to speed, all the city councilors, the members of the staff, and everyone else up to speed on where these ordinances are at to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=706.601s">[Callahan]</a>: figure out what our next steps are, and to basically set when is the next time that we will be discussing these ordinances in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=714.921s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's kind of the goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=716.682s">[Callahan]</a>: And on that note, I would love to have, I'm very excited that we have a wonderful group of volunteers here in the city from Trees Medford who have done a lot of work on this over the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=731.652s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know that they have a long history with this and they have offered to give a, they wrote a letter and if they wouldn't mind reading that in or I could read that for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=743.95s">[Callahan]</a>: or President Bears's gonna be there for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=745.551s">[Callahan]</a>: But then after that, if we can maybe begin with the tree committee ordinance, and if they can give us a tiny introduction to the tree committee ordinance, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=755.574s">[Callahan]</a>: So I don't know if they wanna go ahead and come up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=764.797s">[Callahan]</a>: Go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=953.683s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=955.044s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we want to go ahead and start with the tree committee ordinance, I'm happy to share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=961.43s">[Callahan]</a>: What we have is a redlined version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=969.697s">[Callahan]</a>: And Councilor Beres, can you go ahead and let us know for this redlined version, what are the different colors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=976.162s">[Callahan]</a>: What are the things that are added or removed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1015.02s">[Callahan]</a>: So actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1020.004s">[Callahan]</a>: Zach just did this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1021.065s">[Callahan]</a>: He took your version, and he created a red line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1023.647s">[Callahan]</a>: Because we can't look at the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1042.107s">[Callahan]</a>: So I don't know exactly what we feel is the best way to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1053.457s">[Callahan]</a>: Mm-hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1055.138s">[Callahan]</a>: Do people want me to read it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1056.559s">[Callahan]</a>: Should we just read it silently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1058.041s">[Callahan]</a>: Should I read it out loud for your call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1067.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1068.109s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I'm only just seeing this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1075.655s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1077.716s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1078.157s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1450.367s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1450.868s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, my only question is, I think that the intention is to provide help so that in case, you know, given the new ordinances, there is in fact more work to do that the tree committee might be able to help with that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1466.083s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to be, I want to get your input, like if the language has changed to be like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1473.33s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, when needed, help support DPW in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1477.113s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, would it be okay to include these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1729.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to mention the changes to the appointments and see if anyone had any comments on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1736.539s">[Callahan]</a>: Sounds like, you know, five men for residence up to 10 total, two youth members, one who demonstrates expertise in the field of urban forestry and landscape design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1747.746s">[Callahan]</a>: Just wanted to see if there were any comments on that particular portion since we didn't really, nobody really made any comments before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1788.391s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1788.971s">[Callahan]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1789.352s">[Callahan]</a>: Unless, are you interested in doing an intro to this one or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1799.538s">[Callahan]</a>: I could just do a little bit of the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1801.519s">[Callahan]</a>: It does, this one is preserving, protecting public shade trees and trees otherwise located on public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1810.217s">[Callahan]</a>: And it is different from the third one, which is trees on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1816.663s">[Callahan]</a>: So it looks like, let me see if I can do a little bit about the changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1821.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Looks like there are some changes to the intent and purpose, adding something about MGL Chapter 40A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1831.777s">[Callahan]</a>: A paragraph about that and state legislature granting municipalities rights and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1838.621s">[Callahan]</a>: It does talk about establishing a tree fund to supplement the city budget for tree maintenance, tree planting, stump removal and site preparation for tree planting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1852.003s">[Callahan]</a>: A few changes in the definitions of caliper in terms of diameters of the tree trunks measured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1861.17s">[Callahan]</a>: A few very small minor changes in construction and demolition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1870.578s">[Callahan]</a>: Then this looks like more changes to the diameter at breast height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1879.741s">[Callahan]</a>: Tree diameter in inches measured four and a half feet above the ground for multi stem trees size determined by the measure of all trunks, then adding the total diameter of largest trunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1889.209s">[Callahan]</a>: A new definition of drip line the area directly under the tree at the outer circumference of the tree branches, where most the rainwater shed from the tree canopy drips to the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1901.718s">[Callahan]</a>: Then also a new definition of a landmark tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1906.061s">[Callahan]</a>: Any healthy tree may be designated as a landmark tree if it meets one or more of the following criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1911.105s">[Callahan]</a>: A, a tree that is documented to be 50 years old or older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1914.628s">[Callahan]</a>: B, is 24 inches in diameter or more at breast height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1918.471s">[Callahan]</a>: C, represents a rare species.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1921.173s">[Callahan]</a>: D, is associated with a historical event or person, unusual feature, or scenic enhancement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1926.557s">[Callahan]</a>: All landmark trees are protected trees, except those listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1933.24s">[Callahan]</a>: Then a few very small changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1935.421s">[Callahan]</a>: A change to protective trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1942.264s">[Callahan]</a>: The change to protective trees is accepting trees listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1950.189s">[Callahan]</a>: Looks like a new definition of the tree fund, an account established pursuant to this ordinance for the deposit of payments for mitigating tree removal in lieu of tree replanting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1959.875s">[Callahan]</a>: This fund may only be expended as a means of promoting a healthy tree canopy and will be applied to the cost of site preparation, tree replanting, and new tree maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1969.761s">[Callahan]</a>: And a few other very small changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1974.944s">[Callahan]</a>: The tree warden has some some new language in it, which really is defined in saying as defined in GLC 87 S2 and Medford Ordinances 1974 Chapter 26 Section 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1987.831s">[Callahan]</a>: The tree warden is the city employee responsible for the management of city cities, public trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1994.455s">[Callahan]</a>: Applicability these versions shall apply to the activities related to trees on public land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2001.201s">[Callahan]</a>: Changes to tree permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2005.004s">[Callahan]</a>: In addition, if a public tree has fallen on a house resulting in damage to windows, puncturing roofs, or similar significant damage requiring immediate action, the homeowner may proceed to have the tree taken down after notifying the tree warden and no permit is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2020.563s">[Callahan]</a>: Also under that section of tree permit, city tree removal and replacement, a hearing process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2026.508s">[Callahan]</a>: When the city removes a tree from the sidewalk strip, it must replace the tree within the next planting cycle unless the following procedures are followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2032.974s">[Callahan]</a>: A, if a tree is cut down by the city and is not to be replaced in the next planting cycle, the city must hold a hearing and invite interested parties, tree groups, and residents within the city block to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2041.841s">[Callahan]</a>: The hearing must provide the opportunity for community members to contest the decision not to replace the tree in a timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2047.466s">[Callahan]</a>: B, the decision must be announced on the city's website for one month prior to a hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2051.95s">[Callahan]</a>: C, if the intention is not to replace the tree at all, one month prior to the hearing, the city must inform members of each residence within the city block in writing of their intention not to replace the tree and the reason why the city seeks to reduce the tree canopy in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2064.641s">[Callahan]</a>: The city should plant with native trees wherever possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2067.023s">[Callahan]</a>: Removal of a public tree must include stump removal within 60 days of the tree removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2070.866s">[Callahan]</a>: If removal of a stump within 60 days is not possible, the city must inform residents of the date of removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2076.488s">[Callahan]</a>: And there are more changes under tree planting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2084.834s">[Callahan]</a>: Promote an equitable and diverse urban tree canopy that provides adequate shade for all its neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2090.078s">[Callahan]</a>: That's an addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2093.36s">[Callahan]</a>: Looks like a lot of changes under record keeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2096.209s">[Callahan]</a>: The city will maintain an updated inventory of all public trees, tree removals, and stumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2101.231s">[Callahan]</a>: The tree warden shall keep a publicly available electronic record of removal requests, which shall include the species and size of trees to be removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the trees documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractors involved, and the name and address of the person who requests removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2117.156s">[Callahan]</a>: The city will maintain and make publicly available in electronic form an inventory of trees that includes tree and stump removals and new planting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2126.946s">[Callahan]</a>: New section protection of landmark trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2128.889s">[Callahan]</a>: The city shall make extra efforts to preserve landmark trees, including treating disease trees where feasible, enhancing pruning schedules and regular monitoring of the tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2136.58s">[Callahan]</a>: A landmark tree shall not be cut down or removed without a permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2139.745s">[Callahan]</a>: We are close to the end here under enforcement and penalties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2144.434s">[Callahan]</a>: Two sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2145.514s">[Callahan]</a>: Section A, citizen removal of a public tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2148.215s">[Callahan]</a>: Any person or entity damaging or removing a public tree without authority will be fined, and the fines will be deposited in the tree fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2153.937s">[Callahan]</a>: Enforcement shall be by the tree warden or the tree warden's designee or the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2158.018s">[Callahan]</a>: Citizens may report damage or removal of public trees to the tree warden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2161.9s">[Callahan]</a>: Section B, penalties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2163.462s">[Callahan]</a>: Any person who violates any section of this ordinance or violates any stipulation of a permit issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be fined and the fine shall consist of the cost of compensating the city for the cost of replacing the canopy that was lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2174.005s">[Callahan]</a>: This compensation shall be calculated by measuring the canopy cover used using recent aerial photography such as Google Maps cover coverage or aerial photography, determining the number<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2183.442s">[Callahan]</a>: of young trees that would have the equivalent canopy coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2186.325s">[Callahan]</a>: The fine shall be the sum of the cost of preparing the site, planting those young trees at the current contract rate, and salaries and costs for staff time for selecting, watering, and monitoring those trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2195.737s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is all of the additions and changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2202.917s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we want to have staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2744.11s">[Callahan]</a>: I just figured before we leave this one, it sounds like we want this to go to department heads for their feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2752.678s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we want to wait and have that feedback first before we send it to KPLI?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2757.322s">[Callahan]</a>: I assume we do, because there might be some changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2759.604s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we want to have a cost analysis done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2762.607s">[Callahan]</a>: Or should we have those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2766.01s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to have a better sense of our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2770.865s">[Callahan]</a>: what the different steps are that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2772.867s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I think a cost analysis was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2775.71s">[Callahan]</a>: KP Law, I think, as the last step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3470.759s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3472.061s">[Callahan]</a>: So again, the purpose of this is to protect specified trees on private property in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3480.793s">[Callahan]</a>: I will just go through some of the changes that have been made since the last draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3486.219s">[Callahan]</a>: In the intent and purpose, it does add a last sentence to the first paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3489.34s">[Callahan]</a>: Medford's current tree canopy stands at 29%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3492.821s">[Callahan]</a>: Protecting and increasing trees on private property is one way to protect tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3497.423s">[Callahan]</a>: No trees shall be removed except in accordance with this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3501.084s">[Callahan]</a>: And then there's another added paragraph similar to the public tree ordinance saying state legislature has granted municipalities the right and responsibility, blah, blah, blah, and quoting MGL chapter 40A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3515.455s">[Callahan]</a>: There are some changes in the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3518.757s">[Callahan]</a>: Under Caliper, again, some changes similar to those in the public tree ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3525.239s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition of certified arborist, a professional arborist possessing current certification issued by the International Society of Arboriculture and or the Massachusetts Arborist Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3537.484s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition for code enforcement officer, the building commissioner or designee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3541.926s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition for construction construction permit, a building permit issued by the building department allowing construction demolition or renovation of buildings and structures on a parcel of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3550.783s">[Callahan]</a>: Some tiny changes to definition of construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3553.505s">[Callahan]</a>: A new definition for critical root zone, the minimum area beneath the canopy of a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3564.853s">[Callahan]</a>: The critical root zone is represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk and extending outward towards the tree's dripline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3575.38s">[Callahan]</a>: Small changes to demolition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3577.642s">[Callahan]</a>: More changes to the diameter at breast height, which are similar to those in the public preordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3583.945s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition for developer, an individual or firm who purchases a property in order to improve, renovate, expand or demolish a structure with the purpose of reselling the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3594.31s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, the definition of drip line, same as from the public preordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3601.207s">[Callahan]</a>: Some small changes to the definition of a hazardous tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3605.151s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition of a landmark tree, which is the same, I believe, as from the public one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3612.098s">[Callahan]</a>: Definition of landscape design plan, a written description and scale drawing of the future site that includes the locations of plantings, structures, hardscape, green space, topography, and future canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3623.328s">[Callahan]</a>: A handwritten drawing is acceptable accompanied by photographs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3628.821s">[Callahan]</a>: small changes to the definition of Medford Tree Committee and person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3633.764s">[Callahan]</a>: Protected tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3634.944s">[Callahan]</a>: Any tree on private property with a diameter at breast height of eight inches or more, or a multi-stem tree having an aggregate of 24 inches or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3644.989s">[Callahan]</a>: Species that have a small height at maturity or are slow growing, such as flowering dogwood or American holly, with a DBH of six inches or more are eligible to be considered protected trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3653.934s">[Callahan]</a>: Trees listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3657.095s">[Callahan]</a>: Plants list are not considered protected trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3659.616s">[Callahan]</a>: A few changes to the definition of replacement trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3667.079s">[Callahan]</a>: The trees must be a minimum of three inch caliber and a minimum height of six feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3672.334s">[Callahan]</a>: It again mentions the tree fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3675.976s">[Callahan]</a>: It has tree protection, replacement and mitigation plan, a site plan drawn and stamped by a certified land surveyor or engineer and stamped by a certified arborist or landscape architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3685.721s">[Callahan]</a>: It must show all protected trees as defined herein, including public shade trees near the property and must indicate which protected trees will be retained or removed and how critical root zones of each protected tree and public shade tree will be protected from damage during site work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3701.5s">[Callahan]</a>: Tree removal application process and forms required to be used by any person as defined here in seeking to remove a protected tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3709.392s">[Callahan]</a>: The $100 fee must accompany the application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3712.036s">[Callahan]</a>: The fee will be $35 for owner occupied properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3716.602s">[Callahan]</a>: Tree removal permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3718.499s">[Callahan]</a>: a permit issued by the building department for removal of trees based on the appropriate application process on privately owned property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3724.063s">[Callahan]</a>: In addition to the actual cutting down of living trees, quote, removal includes any act that A, has caused a protected tree to die within the previous 12 months, or B, is likely to cause significant decline or death within a three year period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3738.354s">[Callahan]</a>: One sentence added to tree warden, the duties of the tree warden are redefined in this ordinance to include private trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3746.125s">[Callahan]</a>: And then there are a lot of additions here under applicability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3754.254s">[Callahan]</a>: These versions shall apply to the following activities on privately owned land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3757.437s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you want me to read this whole thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3759.92s">[Callahan]</a>: There's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3762.322s">[Callahan]</a>: There's pages of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3995.117s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=3995.497s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that at this meeting, we're really kind of getting back up to speed with like what the purpose of this is, what some of the ideas are in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4005.003s">[Callahan]</a>: It sounds like it does need some, you know, discussion with the building department of, you know, what we can and can't do, maybe some understanding of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4018.041s">[Callahan]</a>: how this can be covered by zoning and the building department, which I myself don't fully understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4027.204s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm curious about other cities, how they deal with this from a zoning perspective and a building department perspective to see how that is done in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4038.828s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'd be interested in understanding a little bit more about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4046.556s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm hoping that the next step might be to have a sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4049.377s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm happy to be involved with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4054.038s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know Trees Medford has been incredibly generous with their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4057.638s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe we can all sit down and have an understanding, look at some other cities, discuss what's gonna be possible here in Medford as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4240.479s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to quick ask if at this stage, is there anything that we would want to ask of Innocent Associates in terms of their, you know, like, can they give us like a very general sense of like what people do in terms of zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4258.038s">[Callahan]</a>: And without even sending them this whole piece of paper, but maybe with the purpose of it and just say, hey, what do you recommend in terms of zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4269.347s">[Callahan]</a>: Or how would this piece fit into zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4271.869s">[Callahan]</a>: Or if we're too early for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4348.056s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just going to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4352.839s">[Callahan]</a>: I move that Vice President Collins and I work with Therese Medford and the staff to do a next draft and update of this that we will then bring back to Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4370.478s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=4421.456s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=717.469s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=718.45s">[Callahan]</a>: Who knew?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=718.93s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=720.591s">[Callahan]</a>: Mechanical failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=723.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Did you send this out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=724.614s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there a copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=725.594s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we see copies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=729.317s">[Callahan]</a>: What's the name of the, I just don't see the, I'm looking at all of the clerk's emails right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=735.241s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it under the newsletter draft or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=742.866s">[Callahan]</a>: What's the title of the email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=751.65s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I can get it later, but I would like a copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=763.372s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe the clerk can find out the subject and let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=769.734s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see, did I get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=781.276s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, to my Gmail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=785.698s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it only went to my Gmail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=793.361s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1801.192s">[Callahan]</a>: second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1801.913s">[Callahan]</a>: Now it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1803.734s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1804.634s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm really impressed with, you know, initiating the program, having the ideas, then finding out it's not gonna work the way you think, and then finding a way to make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1812.96s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1814.861s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say I am very excited about the owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1817.943s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's exactly the way that we want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1821.406s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, it seems like we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1824.347s">[Callahan]</a>: But I wanted to informally ask that you might come back to this committee in a year and just give us an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1830.311s">[Callahan]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1830.912s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1930.14s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm still on, how nice, how convenient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1933.485s">[Callahan]</a>: Given Councilor Tseng's suggestion, I wonder if there is a way to not tie it to $750.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1942.668s">[Callahan]</a>: I wonder how we can, if there's a way to sort of craft some language that isn't gonna require us every couple of years to be like, well, that's not 750.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2439.052s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, so this is a little bit of an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2440.473s">[Callahan]</a>: I know when we first drafted the, I think we came up with nine different ones we were hoping to do, you know, this year or so, we wanted to take advantage of our community liaisons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2453.883s">[Callahan]</a>: So we split those up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2455.244s">[Callahan]</a>: I have a couple of reports back from those that will be upcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2460.508s">[Callahan]</a>: Hopefully, we also can move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2462.288s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the senior center is fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2464.349s">[Callahan]</a>: We also had, I think, tough students in the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2468.85s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would love for us to, at some point in the new year, to start doing things at each of the schools for parents of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2477.971s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's a great way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2479.231s">[Callahan]</a>: And there's other ways for us to really get into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2482.292s">[Callahan]</a>: I think getting out of this chamber and getting into places where folks who maybe don't come to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2489.073s">[Callahan]</a>: room able to hear from more folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2493.821s">[Callahan]</a>: So my two updates are that this Saturday through the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2501.483s">[Callahan]</a>: um, Arab speaking, uh, liaison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2504.065s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh, we're gonna do one at the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2507.108s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's coming up Saturday at noon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2509.73s">[Callahan]</a>: And then, um, we have two potential dates for doing one through, uh, Stacey Moore, and we decided to do it at the West Medford Community Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2518.998s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, and the two potential dates for that are, um, Saturday, December 7th at 10 or 10.30 a.m., and Saturday, January 4th at 10 or 10.30 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2527.325s">[Callahan]</a>: So we can pick either one of those, and then I can get back to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2577.91s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2578.31s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2578.911s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I would like us to choose now, like sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2707.512s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2707.893s">[Callahan]</a>: We have a few minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2711.634s">[Callahan]</a>: I know I mentioned, you know, maybe doing some at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2715.155s">[Callahan]</a>: I also thought just thought we could have like a couple minutes of brainstorm since we're nearing the end of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2724.033s">[Callahan]</a>: year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2726.514s">[Callahan]</a>: But, you know, I think for parents at the schools, you know, one each at each school might be nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2734.055s">[Callahan]</a>: What do you think of maybe looking at where the lower income Medford residents are and trying to do like neighborhood ones where we flyer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2744.478s">[Callahan]</a>: Just trying to think of like, how can we reach the folks who are like, likely to come here that we don't often hear from and that we would really like to make sure that they're doing okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2939.68s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1068.663s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1069.883s">[Callahan]</a>: So I noticed that there are some younger trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1073.185s">[Callahan]</a>: So the two areas where there will be sunshades, the left one and then the lower one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1077.306s">[Callahan]</a>: Near the lower one, it seems like there are some younger trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1080.327s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm just curious if you anticipate that at the point where those trees become larger, that this is sort of something for the next 10 years that these sunshades will be really helpful and that hopefully those trees will then provide more shade there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1130.82s">[Callahan]</a>: Any thoughts of like planting a tree in the south side so that eventually it will shade that area as well if that's something that we think is necessary long-term?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1142.986s">[Callahan]</a>: I know it's not in this project, but I just thought I would mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1304.039s">[Callahan]</a>: Just one other comment that I really appreciate how much, I'm always impressed with how much our city administration looks for grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1312.723s">[Callahan]</a>: And just so that people know, grants often come with this kind of requirement where there's the grant, but then they also require the city to put in funds that are sort of roughly equivalent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1323.527s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really appreciate the work on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1768.68s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1768.98s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to note for anyone listening that Commissioner McGibbon will be at the next public works meeting in order to give us an update on how these funds be used, what we can kind of expect from this new funding to the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2678.951s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2679.691s">[Callahan]</a>: I so appreciate this, the thought, the gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2684.294s">[Callahan]</a>: I actually went on Amazon and found some solar floodlights that are like either white or multicolored that cost around a hundred bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2691.457s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think this is something that we could easily make happen pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2695.58s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2127.612s">[Callahan]</a>: I just appreciate all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2128.732s">[Callahan]</a>: It's very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2130.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much for adding in things that like vegetative walls, remembering suggestions that we made quite a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2137.375s">[Callahan]</a>: So really appreciate the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2139.095s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2706.278s">[Callahan]</a>: That was that was me seconding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3285.148s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4286.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=842.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=843.493s">[Callahan]</a>: I would note that I forgot to remove that last half of the sentence so at the bottom of full text and description before the potential language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=851.515s">[Callahan]</a>: It should also remove and to encourage the city council to regularly to consider regular cola adjustments that whole half should be removed, because I removed all of that, that that would be my revised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=865.279s">[Callahan]</a>: As I stated in January at the meeting, I believe that, I know that this is the law in a number of states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=873.286s">[Callahan]</a>: It is also the law in some other cities in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=877.99s">[Callahan]</a>: And essentially what it says is that you can vote to change the salaries, but they can't take effect until after the next election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=889.079s">[Callahan]</a>: And that is essentially what I'm proposing be discussed in the governance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=894.023s">[Callahan]</a>: It probably makes sense if, like, if we vote this to the Governance Committee, when the Governance Committee takes it up, for the very first thing be to send it to legal to see whether it could even be passed by an ordinance, or we could do that from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=909.011s">[Callahan]</a>: Because if it can't be passed by an ordinance, and it can only be passed by a charter change, then obviously there's no point in us discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=915.054s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm happy if that's the first step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=967.261s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, thanks to reply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=968.262s">[Callahan]</a>: So what it what this always was even from the beginning was to disallow any future city council from voting to increase their own salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=979.518s">[Callahan]</a>: And then in addition, I had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=983.953s">[Callahan]</a>: put on the agenda to discuss whether the future would have a color adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=989.415s">[Callahan]</a>: But, you know, as I was discussing them with this with some of my volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=994.016s">[Callahan]</a>: Somebody brought up the point that that really doesn't belong in an ordinance, it's not in the other cities ordinances, that would simply be up to city Councilors to bring that up as something if they feel like bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1005.24s">[Callahan]</a>: So the important meat and potatoes of this was always what I have here, which is making it no longer legal for city councilors to increase their own salaries, but simply to vote to increase the salary of a future city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1018.891s">[Callahan]</a>: That's always what this was about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1020.572s">[Callahan]</a>: And I simply removed the part that really shouldn't be part of an ordinance, but would be at the discretion of city councilors in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1254.482s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, I have to comment here because I am really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1258.985s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1262.767s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm supposed to speak to the chair, because I literally was trying to appeal to I think the people who are here because of misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1274.373s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought this up because I wanted to make sure that the city council could never again vote for their own raises that is what this was always about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1283.109s">[Callahan]</a>: It did absolutely not suggest that we have coal increases every year or anything of the kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1290.792s">[Callahan]</a>: If you read the original that I wrote, and look, I can understand if some people read it very quickly and did not understand what that said, but the only thing that it mandated is that no future city council could ever vote to increase their own salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1311.055s">[Callahan]</a>: So I will say that I am feeling surprised that I am trying to bring forward things that I believe the people who are here would genuinely want to be passed, genuinely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1325.441s">[Callahan]</a>: And yet somehow, the part that said like, hey, maybe it should be like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1335.111s">[Callahan]</a>: on an agenda to consider, which does not mean that it should happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1339.134s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, that is the thing people focused on instead of focusing on the only actual thing that it did, which is to make sure no city council could ever vote for their own raises, and I'm surprised that Councilor Scarpelli wants a future city council to vote for their own raises to be able to raise their own salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1355.967s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the only thing that it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1357.808s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I'm...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1361.711s">[Callahan]</a>: I am surprised and I hope that people will read what is actually being proposed instead of making assumptions based on who is putting something forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1372.616s">[Callahan]</a>: What does it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1379.979s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1380.44s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1381.48s">[Callahan]</a>: It says no city council, no change in the salary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1772.487s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that people can discuss what is on here with the removal of that second half of the thing because this is the only thing that is being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2634.563s">[Callahan]</a>: I have revised it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2638.687s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the revised version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2641.931s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not there, it is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2645.314s">[Callahan]</a>: This is all the branches, and this is what I'm trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4006.613s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4012.074s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought this up and I apologize for having anything about COLA in it at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4020.155s">[Callahan]</a>: I wish that it had been this second version, which almost no one talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4027.477s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought this up knowing that it would not be friendly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4036.892s">[Callahan]</a>: to many of my fellow city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4041.613s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought it up because I believe that it is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4045.074s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that city councilors, as is true in many states, and as is true in some other cities in Massachusetts, city councilors should not be able to raise their own salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4056.637s">[Callahan]</a>: That is why I brought this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4059.778s">[Callahan]</a>: I brought it up despite knowing that other city councilors here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4065.865s">[Callahan]</a>: who voted yes, when I voted no against those raises earlier this year, that those other city councilors might have their feelings hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4073.947s">[Callahan]</a>: They might feel that this was not friendly to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4082.169s">[Callahan]</a>: I felt a little ballsy and I felt that I was doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4096.405s">[Callahan]</a>: I still feel that I'm doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4097.806s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't mind being ballsy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4100.407s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just a little bit sad that I am attacked not for what is actually what I am, this, what I am proposing today, which I believe if it had been put forward by councilor, that every person in this room who spoke out against it would be speaking out in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4122.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, maybe I am wrong, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4126.158s">[Callahan]</a>: Wow, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4127.578s">[Callahan]</a>: I should not have said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4128.539s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4129.399s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4131.379s">[Callahan]</a>: I am very sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4136.34s">[Callahan]</a>: I genuinely was trying to do what I believed and continue to believe is the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4143.422s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do hope that things like this can be read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4156.665s">[Callahan]</a>: and spoken about with some attempt at understanding that it is a good faith effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4165.631s">[Callahan]</a>: And literally what is written here and what I am trying to do is to make it not possible for the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4176.417s">[Callahan]</a>: to raise salaries of any sitting elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4181.199s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that is what I personally believe in, and I will stand by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4949.994s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4950.775s">[Callahan]</a>: Six or eight months ago we had these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4957.159s">[Callahan]</a>: So engineer own we're Tella and the Commissioner Tim McGivern at the public works meeting, and it was great to sort of be able to get their take on an update on the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4970.628s">[Callahan]</a>: because they will have the extra $500,000 per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4976.071s">[Callahan]</a>: We want to go ahead and get another update from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4979.112s">[Callahan]</a>: And I invite everyone who's interested in our roads, which I think is everyone, I hope, I'm certainly interested in our roads, to come and have questions for them prepared so that we can get all the information that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5077.688s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5078.888s">[Callahan]</a>: This was something that I talked about a lot, as I was knocking on doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5084.57s">[Callahan]</a>: Last summer, and I found that a lot of people were especially in South Medford we're really interested in helping to plant trees in their city I know that there are other cities that allow residents to help with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5097.833s">[Callahan]</a>: program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5098.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Obviously, it's this only with the proper training with the proper trees at the proper depth, you know, doing everything exactly the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5106.38s">[Callahan]</a>: It sounded like as I talked to Commissioner given that he is open to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5113.245s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is simply to have him come to a meeting and so that we can begin discussing how this might work in our city and get the sort of best ideas of the way this would move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5124.374s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5128.223s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that we might by spring, if spring is the right time to plant trees, that we might be able to have our first pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3112.782s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to note that I was actually kind of peeking through the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3118.946s">[Callahan]</a>: Just now, definitely it specifically calls out the parking of the senior center that that must be that that must be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3130.314s">[Callahan]</a>: I think replaced or continued at least the number of parking spaces, but it also talks about the idea that the parking that is created has to not only consider the senior center, but it also has to account for new business development in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3148.67s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not saying that what's in the RFP, sorry, I'll talk to the, I'm supposed to talk to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3153.814s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not saying that what's in the RFP is definitely what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3158.118s">[Callahan]</a>: will happen in the end product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3159.899s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think that it just so that you know, it is in the RFP specifically that those requests are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3167.244s">[Callahan]</a>: And then this you coming to this meeting is absolutely fantastic, because, you know, it has to come through this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3174.129s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are now extra aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3176.81s">[Callahan]</a>: I also would love to be in one of the future<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3181.053s">[Callahan]</a>: listening sessions at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3184.094s">[Callahan]</a>: And we can even specifically bring up this topic of the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3188.956s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, as we go forward, I think there will be other public meetings about the development that is going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3196.82s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really appreciate all of your comments, and we will take them to heart and we will, you know, make sure to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3202.862s">[Callahan]</a>: be pushing forward as the RFP moves forward through the process, that we will make sure that not only are there enough spaces for the senior center, but also for the growing needs of parking in Medford Square as it grows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3948.987s">[Callahan]</a>: I had a thought as we were discussing this because I and I do remember going to some of those public participation community events organized by the planning department to discuss these three lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3963.391s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, I wonder if there is something of a timing problem because you know that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3970.473s">[Callahan]</a>: At least it was a year and a half ago, or over a year ago for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3974.335s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think what may happen is that when it's so far away from a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3982.599s">[Callahan]</a>: People might not realize that it's going to impact them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3989.163s">[Callahan]</a>: And then when it becomes like now there's an actual RFP and it's already been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3994.488s">[Callahan]</a>: And so now people are worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3996.85s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm wondering if maybe, you know, we can have like just a chit chat with the administration and talk about maybe having, spreading the community meetings in such a way that there are some community meetings closer to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4014.425s">[Callahan]</a>: or like before or after an RFP goes out, because now that it's becoming a reality I think people are realizing the way that it's going to impact their lives in a way that a year and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4025.137s">[Callahan]</a>: It wasn't, it didn't seem like something to attend so anyway, I'm just thinking about that as something that maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4033.826s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, if the administration is in fact, you know, we are having these community meetings, but the timing isn't lining up with what people need in terms of it being really applicable to their lives and then wanting to take the time out to come to these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4048.861s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think I may just have a little, and I might talk to some folks in the administration about that possibility of changing the timing of some of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.423s">[Callahan]</a>: So on page 22 of 39, I just have one question, which is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6493.809s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to make sure there's not a typo in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6496.131s">[Callahan]</a>: I really remembered, and tell me if I'm misremembering, that the height, the building height differential between MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3 was more gradual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6506.942s">[Callahan]</a>: These MX-1 numbers and MX-2 numbers are identical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6509.604s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really thought that it stepped up between MX-1 and MX-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6513.348s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that not accurate, page 22 of 39?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6521.872s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, yep, 22 of 39 of the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6526.053s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought there was a step up between MX1 and MX2 and not like they're identical and there's a giant leap to MX3 in terms of height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6567.487s">[Callahan]</a>: And if I may, I also noticed that co living is explicitly denied in MX one, two and three, which is probably fine, because I'm guessing that those are all going to be one and two bedroom places that are built there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6585.736s">[Callahan]</a>: But just a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7166.807s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7167.467s">[Callahan]</a>: I just have three questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7170.208s">[Callahan]</a>: My first question is at these times in the past, did they have other cost of living adjustments or raises?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7176.649s">[Callahan]</a>: Or are these the only ones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7179.27s">[Callahan]</a>: And my second question is just about parking union titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7183.671s">[Callahan]</a>: Does this include everyone in the department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7185.752s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to understand what parking union titles means, and I understand that it's part of contract negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7195.914s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, my third question is a little more broad, probably not really able to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7204.957s">[Callahan]</a>: So I assume that the reason that we're looking only at raising parking right now is because of union negotiations rather than raising salaries of other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7986.922s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't you don't touch the cemetery soil removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7991.585s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I saw this on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7992.466s">[Callahan]</a>: And I was assuming that was part of the Halloween zombie uprising initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8003.334s">[Callahan]</a>: But I thought it was part of the whole business from Tim McGivern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8006.556s">[Callahan]</a>: Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.159s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.86s">[Callahan]</a>: The Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8013.062s">[Callahan]</a>: You're making me say it four times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8140.165s">[Callahan]</a>: Actually stole my thunder because I was going to ask about that specifically, but I know the tree inventory is, you know, going to be done soon and just was going to ask about the plans for like how to keep that up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9056.943s">[Callahan]</a>: I was only going to say that I did walk by this yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9062.005s">[Callahan]</a>: And there's a, I mean, you can see the retaining wall that has, you know, just totally fallen all the way down the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9069.289s">[Callahan]</a>: It's, it really looks like it's needs immediate attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3227.381s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3229.283s">[Callahan]</a>: So I did have a very quick question, a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3231.807s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, I'm extremely impressed with certainly everything that I had suggested language on or had advocated for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3239.497s">[Callahan]</a>: Everything has gotten in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3241.019s">[Callahan]</a>: Definitions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3242.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Like everything looks wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3243.902s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3246.205s">[Callahan]</a>: making sure that all of these different pieces from the different Councilors made it in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3250.848s">[Callahan]</a>: And my only question looking at this whole thing is really about the environmental resilience piece and the table of development incentive bonuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3260.675s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know we have had a tiny bit of discussion about green score, and here it is, just there's one line, like ideal green score is one additional story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3272.443s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious, like how does that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3276.025s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we haven't passed the green scoring yet, so I'm curious what that looks like if we pass this and we do green score later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3288.889s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious about how that fits together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3717.503s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3717.883s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a quick question, since Director Hunt had mentioned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3722.966s">[Callahan]</a>: There was like a sort of adult stuff allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3727.448s">[Callahan]</a>: Where is that going to be re-added back in here on this map?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=422.754s">[Callahan]</a>: I only just noticed that we are a new blonde chicks panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=428.501s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wanted to talk for a good picture because a lot of people are asking why do we have to increase hope?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=435.27s">[Callahan]</a>: Why are we trying to increase sexism?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=439.495s">[Callahan]</a>: And so the basic question is really, do we have enough money to do the services in our city that we want, that we really are expecting from anyone that lives in any city in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=452.904s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'll start by saying that we rank 320th out of 351 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=457.307s">[Callahan]</a>: That's the 2024 budget, in terms of our budget per capita.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=466.313s">[Callahan]</a>: So that means we have a smaller budget per person than all of the other 58 cities, and it is smaller per person than 90% of towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=477.345s">[Callahan]</a>: The only towns that have a smaller budget per person than we do are all much smaller than New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=483.912s">[Callahan]</a>: So the truth is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=486.195s">[Callahan]</a>: We just can't run a city on the amount of money that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=490.617s">[Callahan]</a>: And Prop 2.5, I don't know how much we're, we need to get into that specifically, but Prop 2.5 in Massachusetts means that if we're gonna raise taxes more than the total amount of taxes that we bring into the city, more than 2.5% per year, we put that on the ballot and ask the voters to make that decision, and that's what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=511.288s">[Callahan]</a>: The other thing I want to raise now, because people ask this question a lot,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=516.19s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there somewhere in our budget that we can scrimp and save?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=523.852s">[Callahan]</a>: This giant blue piece of the pie is our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=528.473s">[Callahan]</a>: I think everyone on both sides of this question understands that we have a huge funding gap in our schools and that we need to find more funding for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=537.315s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=538.896s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=541.28s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot, this is not discretionary, we can't cut that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=545.283s">[Callahan]</a>: The next budget is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=547.225s">[Callahan]</a>: Pensions, again, are a contract, but we cannot just decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=553.312s">[Callahan]</a>: The next two are fire and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=557.114s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that anyone on either side of this fractured and wrapped question wants us to drastically cut our fire department or our police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=566.158s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is DPW highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=569.22s">[Callahan]</a>: That means our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=572.574s">[Callahan]</a>: And the thing that's important to understand about roads is that the more you underfund them, the more money, you're ballooning the amount of debt that you have to pay later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=584.023s">[Callahan]</a>: So, for example, we had a road assessment done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=586.965s">[Callahan]</a>: It has five ratings, one, two, three, four, five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=590.805s">[Callahan]</a>: 49% of our roads fall into the worst two categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=594.587s">[Callahan]</a>: And here's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=595.968s">[Callahan]</a>: It costs at least 30 times as much to fix a category five road as it costs to fix a category two road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=603.632s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you just always fix your category two roads, and always have your roads in good condition, you can actually do it with the state funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=611.797s">[Callahan]</a>: But when you allow them, when you underfund them, and you allow them to get in such a dilapidated state, you just haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=618.14s">[Callahan]</a>: In prior administrations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=620.117s">[Callahan]</a>: You're ballooning the amount of debt that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=623.118s">[Callahan]</a>: So you can't underfront your roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=625.279s">[Callahan]</a>: After roads is bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=628.82s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, we have to pay that money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=631.601s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not something that we can just decide not to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=635.262s">[Callahan]</a>: And now we're getting into these tiny, we're not working up here in these teeny, weeny little ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=641.244s">[Callahan]</a>: With the library, facilities, and other small departments like HR, things we simply cannot cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=648.396s">[Callahan]</a>: There is nowhere in this budget that there's a ton of waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=653.959s">[Callahan]</a>: There's nowhere in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=655.4s">[Callahan]</a>: We already have, over decades, cut and cut and cut and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=661.303s">[Callahan]</a>: There's nowhere else to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=662.764s">[Callahan]</a>: We simply do not have the budget to support a city of our size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=667.406s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would like to pass it to Mayor, if I remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=669.547s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1213.174s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, I think I'm going to take what is free cash, and then the mayor is going to take what are the projects that are waiting in ways for free cash to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1222.384s">[Callahan]</a>: So, free cash, dumb name, not free, not cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1226.328s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1229.249s">[Callahan]</a>: So pre-cash is the official term for, at the end of budget season, let's say your budget was $108 million, and at the end of the budget, you spend $107 million, that $10 million difference, it's called pre-cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1244.638s">[Callahan]</a>: Now maybe you had a little more revenue than you expected, maybe you didn't spend on something you thought you would spend on, but it's very common, and what's important to understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1255.709s">[Callahan]</a>: is that it is recommended by the state of Massachusetts that cities and towns have between 3% and 5% of their budget in free cash each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1266.978s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, 3% to 5% of the federal budget is between $5 million and $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1271.381s">[Callahan]</a>: And the reason it's recommended is because bond agencies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1277.563s">[Callahan]</a>: will give you a rating based in part, so that's one of the things they use to give you a bond rating, which is like a credit rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1284.686s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you don't have free cash, if you end up spending every penny, which I have heard from people like, we should spend every penny, it's mismanaged, we don't spend every penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1295.331s">[Callahan]</a>: It's actually financially mismanaged according to bond agencies and according to the state of Massachusetts if you spend every penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1302.615s">[Callahan]</a>: It is considered that you are not being financially responsible with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1307.264s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the most important thing to understand is that we need to have free cash in order to have a good profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1314.347s">[Callahan]</a>: And what else can I say about free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1316.588s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe the next thing is just to talk about what it gets used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1320.71s">[Callahan]</a>: The one other thing I will say is that in 2024, we, for the first time, created a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1330.534s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, we were one of the last five municipalities out of 351, sorry, 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1337.675s">[Callahan]</a>: We were one of the last five to create one, so we finally did that, and that's where you're supposed to put pre-cash so that it can be spent on capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1805.573s">[Callahan]</a>: And just quickly, the city council has been working on rezoning, and we're pretty excited about this to ask, because we're gonna rezone for a lot of mixed use and a lot higher stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1817.843s">[Callahan]</a>: It'll gradually, as it goes away from the metro squares, it'll gradually get more and more stories, but we're very excited about the amount of people who might have their, and I will also just, I will switch over to Ross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1828.772s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1831.674s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the commercial sector, new growth, and I don't know how much you can see, but the last two years have been higher new growth than any time in the last 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1841.243s">[Callahan]</a>: So we really are doing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1889.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, we haven't actually explained Prop 2.5 fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1893.051s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you like to start by explaining Prop 2.5?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1897.151s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me just do Prop 2.5 and override versus a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1901.972s">[Callahan]</a>: So, unlike almost every other state in the country,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1905.765s">[Callahan]</a>: where city councils are allowed to raise the taxes that they determine that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1910.388s">[Callahan]</a>: They're elected, they run on it, they either want to raise taxes or they want to not raise taxes, and then as elected officials, they make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1918.733s">[Callahan]</a>: In Massachusetts, a statewide ballot measure passed in 1980 that said that no city or town can raise the total tax levy, total amount of money brought into the city, more than 2.5% per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1934.914s">[Callahan]</a>: New growth changes the model, that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1938.395s">[Callahan]</a>: But the point is not that they can't raise the taxes, it's simply that to raise those taxes, they put it on the ballot and they allow the voters to make that decision for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1949.52s">[Callahan]</a>: Even the proponents of Prop 10.5 did not want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1953.101s">[Callahan]</a>: So it used to go 30 years without ever 40 years without ever putting it on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1957.523s">[Callahan]</a>: They believed that it should be put on the ballot and the voters should decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1961.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Override is something that you increase the total amount that the tax levy can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1971.156s">[Callahan]</a>: So in our case, it would be $3.5 million for question 7, $4 million more for question 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1980.238s">[Callahan]</a>: And at that point, that becomes a new tax levy, and that can be increased 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1988.712s">[Callahan]</a>: because it has a limited, it can only be used for the thing, well, they can both only be used for what they're supposed to be for, but it's for capital projects, and once it is paid off, that tax then goes down again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2005.014s">[Callahan]</a>: That's pretty much it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2599.155s">[Callahan]</a>: The only thing I have to add is once you negotiate contracts with the teachers, then you have a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2615.09s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see how that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2617.592s">[Callahan]</a>: And how often have we cut the school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4902.902s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to say one very quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4905.423s">[Callahan]</a>: Every year, for the last 40 years, that we have not put this on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4910.684s">[Callahan]</a>: We have not allowed our community to make these decisions for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=374.985s">[Callahan]</a>: In the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=375.766s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh huh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=377.627s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, that's looking good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=378.968s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=380.629s">[Callahan]</a>: Tasty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=382.17s">[Callahan]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=383.811s">[Callahan]</a>: Just there's a typo at the end of the first general business point and invest $4 million to invest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=943.587s">[Callahan]</a>: I've looked through everything and it looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=945.767s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that Councilor Tseng is updating just the governance committee one, but I think my committee is good and the rest of it looks good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=953.45s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much for putting it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1179.341s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just, didn't we also have that commemoration of Larry Lepore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1184.966s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm wondering, do we, in the past, we've left those off of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1190.97s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is accurate that we have not put in like the personal ones about, you know, I started so I started I started doing that because I figured it was it was nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1225.856s">[Callahan]</a>: We'll want to put Larry Lepore in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1228.458s">[Callahan]</a>: Larry Lepore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1351.668s">[Callahan]</a>: And I actually do have one like to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1354.289s">[Callahan]</a>: This seems grammatically awkward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1356.49s">[Callahan]</a>: This section that I like we started discussions on the city charter review process, including setting a timeline as we expect the Charter Review Committee's recommendations to like to me there has to be an ending to that sentence, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1380.626s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not sure what you mean as we expect them to continue to arrive or as we expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1401.18s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1447.461s">[Callahan]</a>: I move to approve and send to, just to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1474.388s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1493.075s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1266.807s">[Callahan]</a>: Just clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1267.448s">[Callahan]</a>: So it sounds like this is to ensure that we are in line with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1273.614s">[Callahan]</a>: So state law already has changed, and we want to have something explicitly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1278.177s">[Callahan]</a>: supporting the state law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1298.213s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1591.998s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1592.439s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think in addition to the cost, which is important, I would love to have, you know, either if you have already done some of this research, possibly we do more research into the need in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1606.693s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, I'm sure you've already thought of this, but we may want to reach out to the Disabilities Commission, we may want to see if we can reach out to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1615.888s">[Callahan]</a>: Mothers with newborns and small babies because I just remember from that time period that like finding a bathroom that had a changing space was like absolutely crucial and if I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1626.175s">[Callahan]</a>: couldn't find one, it's like very bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1628.256s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe we can think of other, you know, groups of people that might have special needs or not even that special, but like, you know, some understanding of what the need is in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1643.225s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that would also help us sort of make the case for the cost of these going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1649.389s">[Callahan]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=775.169s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I also did not know him nearly as well as I wish I had, but I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=785.444s">[Callahan]</a>: we will really never be able to replace him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=788.985s">[Callahan]</a>: No matter who we get for this position, we won't be able to replace him because of his personality and because of who he was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=797.767s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm, you know, someday we'll have someone in that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=800.108s">[Callahan]</a>: They'll be different, but Larry is definitely truly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2668.185s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2669.727s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2674.631s">[Callahan]</a>: And as Councilor Leming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2685.001s">[Callahan]</a>: in the amount of budget we have per person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2687.623s">[Callahan]</a>: So we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2695.39s">[Callahan]</a>: All of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2700.154s">[Callahan]</a>: Our budget is too small to provide the services that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2704.477s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2710.661s">[Callahan]</a>: And this large blue area here is the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2715.664s">[Callahan]</a>: That is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2719.987s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2723.369s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is something that we are required to have by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2726.791s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot cut that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2728.132s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2730.155s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are contractual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2731.737s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot cut pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2733.74s">[Callahan]</a>: The next two are our fire department and our police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2737.845s">[Callahan]</a>: My feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2746.016s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one after police and fire is our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2749.461s">[Callahan]</a>: And I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt it's called the road backlog 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2761.857s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2763.338s">[Callahan]</a>: After that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2774.121s">[Callahan]</a>: None of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2782.624s">[Callahan]</a>: Our budget is simply too small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2784.225s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2786.985s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3665.382s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3666.483s">[Callahan]</a>: I hear a lot of people asking about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3669.484s">[Callahan]</a>: I think misunderstanding what free cash is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3672.005s">[Callahan]</a>: First thing I'd like to say is, free cash, dumb name, it's not free, it's not cash, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3675.947s">[Callahan]</a>: So, free cash, sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3680.349s">[Callahan]</a>: Free, free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3693.575s">[Callahan]</a>: May I get my two minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3696.401s">[Callahan]</a>: Will I get my two minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3699.043s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3700.763s">[Callahan]</a>: Free cash is the term that the state uses for the money that is left over after your budget season has ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3709.968s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's the difference between what you budget, which, let's say, is $180 million, and the amount you spent, which, let's say, is $172 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3714.69s">[Callahan]</a>: That $8 million, which is the difference, is called free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3722.313s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, the state of Massachusetts has a group called the Division of Local Services, and their job is to help cities and towns become financially responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3732.523s">[Callahan]</a>: They highly recommend that cities and towns in Massachusetts have 3 to 5% of their budget left over in free cash every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3742.867s">[Callahan]</a>: In Medford, that amount would be between $5 million and $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3747.329s">[Callahan]</a>: If you don't have between 3 and 5% of your budget left over in free cash, you are considered financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3753.932s">[Callahan]</a>: by credit agencies and your bond rating goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3757.514s">[Callahan]</a>: Now that is very bad because it changes, just like if your credit rating is bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3761.715s">[Callahan]</a>: It changes the amount that you have to spend anytime you borrow money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3765.397s">[Callahan]</a>: So we want to be a financially responsible city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3768.698s">[Callahan]</a>: So having money left over in free cash, and I'm going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3773.02s">[Callahan]</a>: I have another chart here because I think it's important for people to understand that this city was in the past very financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3782.868s">[Callahan]</a>: If you notice that before 2012, we couldn't even meet our budget many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3788.472s">[Callahan]</a>: We definitely never reached that 3% in free cash and our bond rating was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3794.697s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's only in recent years that we have begun to have anywhere close to the required 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3801.162s">[Callahan]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3802.342s">[Callahan]</a>: Now free cash according to the state of Massachusetts should never be used for an operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3808.284s">[Callahan]</a>: It needs to be used for capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3810.444s">[Callahan]</a>: We currently because of underfunding of our roads have $67 million in road debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3815.586s">[Callahan]</a>: We have $79 million in our capital improvement plan for things that need to be done only in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3821.274s">[Callahan]</a>: Three to five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.995s">[Callahan]</a>: So we cannot use free cash for something like our school budget that is absolutely verboten according to financially responsible people in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4994.605s">[Callahan]</a>: two minutes councilor calvin and then councilor collins very quickly the reason that those other cities don't have as much money in free cash is because they weren't last to the table in getting a stabilization fund having a stabilization fund again is considered financially responsible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5010.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Medford didn't have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5012.755s">[Callahan]</a>: There are 451 cities and towns in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5016.896s">[Callahan]</a>: We are one of the last five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5019.317s">[Callahan]</a>: Only five remained this year that did not have a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5023.038s">[Callahan]</a>: That's why we have all this free cash, because we didn't have any stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6437.822s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much for your correction, because I do know it's 351.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6441.105s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm surprised that I said that, but thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6643.482s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to speak to the question, which is, where is the money going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6648.825s">[Callahan]</a>: So my understanding is that in that first year is when that strong encouragement to spend it on what was mentioned in the- It's a legal requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6657.368s">[Callahan]</a>: A legal requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6658.209s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6659.069s">[Callahan]</a>: A legal requirement to spend it on what was talked about in the ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6663.451s">[Callahan]</a>: But what happens over time, because Prop 2.5 overrides<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6670.282s">[Callahan]</a>: don't end, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6671.082s">[Callahan]</a>: They sort of just mean that the total amount of the budget is increased and that will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6679.567s">[Callahan]</a>: It is a sustainable source of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6681.688s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that means is that over time, there may be, you know, like 10 years later, 15, 20, 30 years later, it may be that that budget needs, you know, the city council should be able to spend that budget in the way that makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6696.655s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6699.036s">[Callahan]</a>: It's a legal requirement at the beginning, but it does go into the general fund, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8276.116s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure, I think it's important to understand that the money from both seven and eight will go to the schools, obviously not the 500,000 for the roads, but the rest of it, and that it is the job of the school committee with the mayor and with the school superintendent and the financial people and the whole administration of the schools to figure out how best to serve children with that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8305.484s">[Callahan]</a>: It's possible that a tiny percentage of that may be necessary to boost our busing so that young kids are not walking across dangerous intersections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8318.456s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm not going to be making that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8321.059s">[Callahan]</a>: That's simply a tiny example since people have mentioned busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8327.725s">[Callahan]</a>: a zillion different decisions that can be made when you're talking about the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8333.008s">[Callahan]</a>: And it's the job of that part of the electeds and administration, the school committee, as well as the administration of the school system to make the best decisions each year, given what is happening that year with the budget that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8349.859s">[Callahan]</a>: And of course, as always, with the best interests of the students in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8992.506s">[Callahan]</a>: That's a tough question to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8994.047s">[Callahan]</a>: I simply want to say that chronic underfunding, unfortunately, causes people to mistrust their government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9002.709s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, half of our roads are in the worst two road conditions, and that's from chronic underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9011.692s">[Callahan]</a>: It costs between 30 and 50 times as much to fix a road in condition five, that's the worst one, as it does to fix a road in condition two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9022.864s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, we would be able to pay every year for all of our roads to get repaired with chapter 90 funding if we never let them fall into that kind of disrepair, but through underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9035.97s">[Callahan]</a>: chronic decades long underfunding, we have created a city that cannot service basic, basic needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9043.576s">[Callahan]</a>: And that does make people mistrust the government, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9046.918s">[Callahan]</a>: But the fix is, and someone here mentioned, you know, that what other communities do when they're in these situations is bonds and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9056.905s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that what other communities do in this situation is they pass a prop two and a half override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10290.473s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10291.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Always good to see young folks coming up here and asking these great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10297.496s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to talk a little bit about the difference between 7 and 8, Proposition 7, Proposition 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10306.04s">[Callahan]</a>: And 7 is going to make sure that we provide the same resources and the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10312.486s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, budget, basically, that we have been providing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10317.33s">[Callahan]</a>: Prop eight is gonna be where we make sure that we can actually really do a little bit more, that we can take care of our teachers, that we can pay them better salaries, that we can pay paras better salaries, that we take care of them the way that they are taking care of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10336.086s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's just a little bit about the difference between those two and why they're separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10343.295s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.268s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.768s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, these questions are better answered by school committee folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10861.129s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding is that you can't really compare what our entire school budget is to other cities very well, because other cities don't include a lot of the things that we include in the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10872.911s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's not apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10874.991s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wish I could rattle off all the things that are included and not included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10878.792s">[Callahan]</a>: The ones that I recall are, I think, IT, and now because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10883.661s">[Callahan]</a>: post COVID, there's just a lot more, you know, Chromebooks required for students and other IT related things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10890.563s">[Callahan]</a>: IT is often not included in school budgets in other cities, but it is included in our school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10895.544s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are parts of building maintenance that are included in our school budget that are not included in other city school budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10901.326s">[Callahan]</a>: So while it appears, if you just look at the number, it appears that we spend more per student,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10909.005s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't believe that that is an accurate way of looking at it simply because of the things that are and aren't included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10914.67s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I just wanted to comment about the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10918.253s">[Callahan]</a>: Unless I'm mistaken, please correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10921.216s">[Callahan]</a>: We have one of the shortest school days of anywhere in the entire state that we are barely like a minute or two above the state absolute minimum for the number of minutes that children have to spend in school across the entire year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12169.994s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a super quick comment that teachers who are underpaid compared to how much they could make in other cities, they do think about whether the city is able to fund them the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12182.738s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we want people to stay, it's just healthier for us in terms of teacher morale and longevity to have, for them to know that the budget is there for their salaries for the next year, because people do try to think ahead<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12200.057s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, they're less, we'll just have more turnover, that's all, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12841.913s">[Callahan]</a>: If I can, oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12843.054s">[Callahan]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12846.367s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just um, so my understanding is that there are some numbers going around comparing Medford salaries with communities like Arlington, but actually just have an accurate numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12858.497s">[Callahan]</a>: And, and those are all public so you can actually go on the web and like look up those numbers so I encourage you to do that just to make sure that the numbers that you're seeing are accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12865.783s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.305s">[Callahan]</a>: I love that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.966s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13931.529s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are a few basic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13935.354s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't want to say rules of engagement, but just pieces of advice that people hopefully understand as like good for group dynamics healthy for a community healthy for a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13947.177s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that people in their conversations with neighbors can think about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13951.123s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that we on the council can also do these things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13954.247s">[Callahan]</a>: They are things like treat other people with respect and dignity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13960.815s">[Callahan]</a>: Assume good intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13963.431s">[Callahan]</a>: Don't assume that the other person means you ill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13967.312s">[Callahan]</a>: Just assume that they have good intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13969.992s">[Callahan]</a>: Listen to what folks are actually saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13974.953s">[Callahan]</a>: Don't use accusational language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13978.754s">[Callahan]</a>: Basic decorum, basic showing respect for other people is what I encourage for everyone in all of their discussions with the friends, family, neighbors, city councilors, and all of those folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13991.801s">[Callahan]</a>: And I hope that if I am not following that, people will call me out, because I do hope that I can always treat everyone, no matter what their political position on a topic is, with respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14007.644s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=618.988s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=620.349s">[Callahan]</a>: So, in looking over these I had a few comments, starting with the co housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=625.013s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that definition is pretty good, but if you look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=630.017s">[Callahan]</a>: So, in Cambridge there are two different co housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=636.041s">[Callahan]</a>: places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=637.102s">[Callahan]</a>: One of them is more like townhouses, and the other one is more larger buildings, a little bit more like apartment buildings, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=648.986s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I would want to, like, I think the definition of co-housing hopefully should not limit it to small single unit or two unit buildings, but rather be a building or set of buildings, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=666.36s">[Callahan]</a>: just to open it up a little bit in case people want to basically build co-housing that's a little bit more like an apartment building but has a bunch of shared facilities as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=677.205s">[Callahan]</a>: My second one is about co-living and I think what I'm hoping to do is to make a distinction between co-living and which is tenants choosing to live with each other as something we specifically want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=697.271s">[Callahan]</a>: allow and encourage in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=699.813s">[Callahan]</a>: And there's also something else that I think we specifically want to discourage in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=704.755s">[Callahan]</a>: And the difference is really whether the tenants select who the other tenants are, or whether the landlord selects the tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=712.92s">[Callahan]</a>: So for example, I did a slight update to the co-living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=719.11s">[Callahan]</a>: saying a building in which a group of residents pay rent to occupy a single unit with private bedrooms and shared living spaces, including cooking and sanitary facilities, such residents have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=733.397s">[Callahan]</a>: And I have a little bit of extra language in case it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=735.979s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know whether it's necessary, but the end of that sentence could be either because they apply for the lease jointly or because when one or more tenants moves out, the residents jointly select a new tenant to add to the lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=748.854s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that the concept that residents have input over the selection of the other residents is important in co-living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=759.0s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the one I would want to discourage is basically the same, but saying residents of this other thing, which I don't know what the name would be, do not have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=818.149s">[Callahan]</a>: You say a group of residents pay to rent, pay rent to occupy a single unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=839.878s">[Callahan]</a>: Great and I would love that that'd be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=843.061s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's most of my, my, my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=848.847s">[Callahan]</a>: I did notice when I was looking through the definition, the definition of like a lodger, and of a lodging house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=857.765s">[Callahan]</a>: To me the definition of a lodger was not clear but apparently it is pretty clear because you know to the staff because they have been dealing with this code for you know this zoning for you know many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=868.058s">[Callahan]</a>: They understand what it means which maybe is plenty and that's all we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=874.162s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that lodger and lodging house were related to each other, which apparently they really aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=880.186s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the lodging house definition is slightly problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=886.39s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me just find, sorry if I can find that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=895.495s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, my other comment about congregate living is I don't know that we need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=899.016s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that elderly-oriented congregate living, we have a lot of senior housing definitions already in our zoning, so I'm not sure that having an elderly-oriented congregate housing would conflict with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=919.34s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I'll leave it there, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1569.559s">[Callahan]</a>: That's your calling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1573.161s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think we need a motion at this point because NS and associates is going to take this feedback and bring it back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1578.404s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1658.645s">[Callahan]</a>: My only question is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1662.751s">[Callahan]</a>: I sent an email with the language that I had suggested, which doesn't have to be exact, but is there anything else that we should do with this language or will Innocence Associates come back to us with these updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2364.158s">[Callahan]</a>: Hello, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2365.258s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not at my desk anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2367.779s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, so this, the northernmost commercial lot on the south side of the street, the sort of easternmost, just wondering about that being commercial as opposed to one of the mixed use, just because it does abut right up to the public housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2638.188s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just gonna want, out of my curiosity, like, is there a reason why this, because it seems like we have a distinction between these two, and like it would make more sense to the I if this was commercial than that was commercial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2649.618s">[Callahan]</a>: Like just, you know, is there a reason why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2652.42s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it because of the size of the lots, or is there some reason why this is, excuse, and that's commercial instead of switching those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4090.404s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4091.765s">[Callahan]</a>: Just super quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4092.966s">[Callahan]</a>: We still are intending to have a co-working definition added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4096.829s">[Callahan]</a>: Since it was mentioned that like a co-working space, I just wanted to double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4178.96s">[Callahan]</a>: All I know is that when I was doing some research into it, it seemed like co-working spaces had difficulty finding an appropriate place within zoning in most cities, and I don't remember exactly why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4189.066s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm looking to see if I can find why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4190.887s">[Callahan]</a>: I might be able to find it in about one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4306.955s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4307.515s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4308.812s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4309.553s">[Callahan]</a>: And just to close up that thought I found the whole thread that I had run into before, and they are in fact talking about the fact that a lot of co working spaces want to be in retail, where there's zone for retail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4321.746s">[Callahan]</a>: And they don't want to be shunted off into like commercial office space zones because it doesn't really work for co working nobody wants to rent there if it is in that space so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4331.463s">[Callahan]</a>: as long as we're aiming toward, like this whole idea of mixed use, maybe, you know, it'll fit perfectly in there, but as long as that's in our minds, and I think, yes, we will wanna have co-working definitions, both to promote it, as well as to enable it to be the tiny little, in the same way that retail in our code, I don't know if we're continuing this, has different definitions for like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4360.087s">[Callahan]</a>: convenience store and other kinds of stores that have different sizes, there may be usefulness to having that sort of definition for co-working so that we can have like neighborhood co-working spaces that are tiny in, you know, more across the residential neighborhoods, as well as be able to have more ones like on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4379.623s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4407.877s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, Councilor Calderon, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4408.957s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4409.878s">[Callahan]</a>: Only because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4412.832s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. DiStefano, you had mentioned the idea of tough students and how many businesses they were coming out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4420.636s">[Callahan]</a>: And it made me think about the spaces, not just co-working spaces, but for example, in Kendall Square, they also have places where they have accelerator programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4436.865s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't know whether that would be something at all interesting to us or if it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4441.334s">[Callahan]</a>: if there's any difference between that and co-working, if there's any reason to define it differently, but just in the back of our minds to think about how do we have a technology hub here in Medford, where not just from Tufts, but also from maybe some sort of tech hub, a startup generator, if we can encourage that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=671.947s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wasn't sure if I quite understood you properly, but this, I assume, has not yet gone to legal review, like we're finalizing it to make sure that it's what staff needs first, and then we'll send it to legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=682.315s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=684.236s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1262.183s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=42.412s">[Callahan]</a>: You can borrow mine in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2634.712s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=50.328s">[Callahan]</a>: in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=51.409s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. Clerk, would you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=68.201s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=69.922s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=70.663s">[Callahan]</a>: Today we are talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=73.41s">[Callahan]</a>: Resolution 24-422, resolution to host a discussion of MassDOT plans for Medford Square Main Street intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=83.264s">[Callahan]</a>: Whereas the Massachusetts Department of Transportation is planning to make changes to a busy intersection in the heart of Medford Square,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=90.37s">[Callahan]</a>: which will impact drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians for many years to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=95.354s">[Callahan]</a>: And whereas the Medford Bicycle Commission attended an informational meeting and expressed concerns with the plans made thus far, now therefore be it resolved that a representative from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation familiar with the plan shall meet with the Medford City Council, a representative of the Medford Bicycle Commission, and a representative of the City of Medford Traffic and Transportation Department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=117.549s">[Callahan]</a>: in committee to discuss said plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=119.631s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a resolution of Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=122.493s">[Callahan]</a>: I leave it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=349.278s">[Callahan]</a>: Fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=349.718s">[Callahan]</a>: Let's go to Emily O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=974.676s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, uh, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1231.445s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1232.445s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have any other councilors that want to speak on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1236.487s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lennon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1280.498s">[Callahan]</a>: If I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1281.118s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1282.6s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the meeting we're having right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1284.895s">[Callahan]</a>: This is this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1285.955s">[Callahan]</a>: So this resolution isn't to have another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1288.557s">[Callahan]</a>: The resolution which got passed through the city council was to have this meeting right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1305.684s">[Callahan]</a>: I will ask for any public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1308.225s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone in the chamber?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1309.026s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1318.214s">[Callahan]</a>: It is Council President Zac Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1322.602s">[Callahan]</a>: The floor is yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1490.921s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1492.262s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyone else like to speak on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1495.766s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, I do see Emily O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1497.288s">[Callahan]</a>: If you want to speak one more time, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1629.977s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1630.237s">[Callahan]</a>: And I see that Todd Blake, Director of Traffic and Transportation, is raising his hand as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1634.804s">[Callahan]</a>: Go ahead, Todd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1694.706s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1695.647s">[Callahan]</a>: It's amazing that you're there to help us facilitate the extra meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1700.851s">[Callahan]</a>: Any other comments from the public or from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1707.585s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, thank you so much to everyone, Councilor Lazzaro, to Mr. Blake, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1713.009s">[Callahan]</a>: O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1714.41s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, Councilor Lazzaro, do you wanna go ahead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1719.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful, thank you to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1721.075s">[Callahan]</a>: And Councilor Lazzaro has motioned to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1722.636s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1725.378s">[Callahan]</a>: No one is seconding the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1727.059s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1729.661s">[Callahan]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1730.722s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1732.223s">[Callahan]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1736.328s">[Callahan]</a>: That is an aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1736.973s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1737.96s">[Callahan]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=486.586s">[Callahan]</a>: I move that we take this out of order, put it at the end of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=496.75s">[Callahan]</a>: I retract my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3273.692s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3277.485s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3278.605s">[Callahan]</a>: Glad this is on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3279.706s">[Callahan]</a>: I think hearing from constituents and also informing constituents is crucially important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3287.068s">[Callahan]</a>: Among the many vulnerable populations we have here I think our children are definitely on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3293.87s">[Callahan]</a>: I would hope that parents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3296.382s">[Callahan]</a>: would be explicitly reached out to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3298.024s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if we can go through the PTOs of the various schools, but I think that those people also will be highly, highly impacted by the override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3307.771s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would hope that we can not only reach out to seniors who are a vulnerable population, but also reach out to parents and make sure that they are also included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3447.485s">[Callahan]</a>: Reaching out through, say, if we're going through the senior center, then also being able to go through the PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5290.216s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5668.968s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5670.029s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5672.872s">[Callahan]</a>: You just said what I was going to say, which is it is important for people to understand this does not eliminate MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5679.778s">[Callahan]</a>: Some people are confused about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5681.72s">[Callahan]</a>: It simply removes it as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5685.744s">[Callahan]</a>: I completely agree that it is really damaging as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5691.008s">[Callahan]</a>: So just as long as people understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5693.511s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1285.942s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I just figured while we're getting the Zoom up, we could ask some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1528.841s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1529.881s">[Callahan]</a>: So I have one, just a question for my own curiosity, and then I also have a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1535.905s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm curious why the commercial is like 50% lot coverage and the other ones are 80% lot coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1542.849s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that like a standard thing, and is there a reason why that's so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1583.019s">[Callahan]</a>: And I saw that and I'm curious about like permeable surfaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1586.002s">[Callahan]</a>: If it's going to be 80% lot coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1588.023s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have a recurrent just because I know in that area, we're really concerned about it being a heat island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1641.279s">[Callahan]</a>: My final, oh, did you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1712.005s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1712.726s">[Callahan]</a>: My final kind of suggestion was, because I live down there and I'm, and I, my kid goes to the method took looking at option B. I wonder if, rather than that sort of southwestern portion being all commercial, if it's possible to split that and have commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1732.469s">[Callahan]</a>: Right on the road and then having those back parcels be mixed use or something else not have so much of the audio auto usage close to the school and the park and also this public housing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1745.397s">[Callahan]</a>: So having you know a little bit nicer usages right butting up to those those three would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2327.188s">[Callahan]</a>: Back, you mentioned that maybe keeping that not having incentive zoning and keeping that to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2334.177s">[Callahan]</a>: I wasn't sure if he was asking about that, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3150.548s">[Callahan]</a>: Mine was actually very similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3151.508s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious if it would be useful for us to have a definition of life sciences or R&D in the definitions, or if simply having a maximum height that allows for taller stories would be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3549.857s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3552.159s">[Callahan]</a>: This may not be something you guys can answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3554.08s">[Callahan]</a>: But, um, in terms of like commercial buildings, uh, I know that ever since Covid, there's a lot less need for commercial buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3562.526s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we still think that there is enough need that if we zone something that is purely commercial that, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3571.22s">[Callahan]</a>: people going to be developing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3656.738s">[Callahan]</a>: And just as a follow-up question to that, given the, I guess, ongoing crash in commercial real estate, do we think, in terms of this option A or B, I just wanna get a sense for like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3679.203s">[Callahan]</a>: If we exclude commercial, do we think that we'll be missing out on folks who want to develop here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3683.625s">[Callahan]</a>: If we include commercial, will we be risking having a whole zone that does not have a lot of demand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3690.808s">[Callahan]</a>: Just obviously, you can't fully answer this question, but do you have a sense between those two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5985.717s">[Callahan]</a>: incentive zoning not being in that one section, but I assume that everything else would have incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6000.244s">[Callahan]</a>: And also behind, like, yeah, the HICSAB one, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6005.886s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6006.186s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6006.566s">[Callahan]</a>: It does have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=498.355s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=499.396s">[Callahan]</a>: It might be nice to say something like the city council is taking the issue of rodents in our city seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=507.24s">[Callahan]</a>: Like start off with sort of the purpose of the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=527.26s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=528.601s">[Callahan]</a>: And the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance is one of our tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=532.744s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that just helps people to kind of understand, like, if I just see the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, I don't really know what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=540.628s">[Callahan]</a>: But like, if it's like, we're taking rodents seriously, and this is one of our tools for doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=863.717s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to update that next sentence a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=866.159s">[Callahan]</a>: The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that residents do not intentionally feed wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=870.922s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that's quite right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=871.963s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's more like do not feed unwanted wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=879.408s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, it's really the purpose is to make sure that, you know, people aren't accidentally providing food for pests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=887.967s">[Callahan]</a>: But I don't know exactly how to phrase that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=892.449s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I don't think anybody's intentionally feeding rodents, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=900.092s">[Callahan]</a>: That's not a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1857.023s">[Callahan]</a>: I would lean toward, I agree with putting all three of those at the top because it is a thing that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1867.847s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I would put ordinances, the definition of ordinance down with the commonly used terms and keep it out of that one line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1876.405s">[Callahan]</a>: the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1876.745s">[Callahan]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1882.827s">[Callahan]</a>: Um well, I would remove motion the previous, I can't see it cuz it's covered by the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1898.75s">[Callahan]</a>: I suspect that for people who are, you know, coming to their first city council meeting or something, that is not a thing they need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1907.551s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just take that one out because I don't think it's like super important to know that one motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1913.035s">[Callahan]</a>: There's other stuff that we could put in there in terms of commonly used terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1916.577s">[Callahan]</a>: I would rather see ordinance than that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1919.519s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1920.14s">[Callahan]</a>: I would remove that one and put in ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2242.5s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2243.36s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that what Councilor Lazzaro was saying was that this is going to be improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2249.043s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that there are different people who understand things in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2253.525s">[Callahan]</a>: And I completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2254.486s">[Callahan]</a>: I think this is fantastic for what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2256.627s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the idea of laminated copies being in this room for people to just like maybe on every row, there's a copy and people can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2265.772s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would love to offer to work with Councilor Lazzaro on the apples and worms version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1677.967s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1679.068s">[Callahan]</a>: So currently those fees, I assume they are associated with not just rodent control, right, that you have to have themsters and that seems like a normal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1689.207s">[Callahan]</a>: fee for any kind of construction that is not solely for rodent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1693.35s">[Callahan]</a>: Are those fees going into the general fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1696.412s">[Callahan]</a>: Are we, I mean, I don't know how large this is and if there will be some pushback from other parts of the administration that, you know, these fees really are not just for rodent control and perhaps should be going to the general budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2503.039s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2181.749s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to suggest that we consider giving the weekend hours to one, perhaps not the during the week, as sort of matching with with during the week is just till midnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2197.815s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, but during the week is till midnight, which is later than they're currently are, which was 11pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2202.057s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2203.542s">[Callahan]</a>: believe so yes yes so that is what I'm suggesting that it be weekend till one during the week till 11 but a little bit of a compromise on that point I don't I also don't particularly see a reason why consistency is the reason why we should agree or not agree I think you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2224.141s">[Callahan]</a>: different businesses are in different areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2226.323s">[Callahan]</a>: They have neighbors closer or farther away from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2228.965s">[Callahan]</a>: They have different track records of complaints with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2233.228s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's pretty clear that Panda Express has all of those check boxes that we want to see in terms of being pretty distant from the closest housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2245.978s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think there could be some consideration to a possibility of giving them the extended hours for the weekend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2254.693s">[Callahan]</a>: for this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2852.357s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2853.557s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2855.238s">[Callahan]</a>: It would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2856.478s">[Callahan]</a>: I also agree that, you know, we have to be aware of costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2860.379s">[Callahan]</a>: I simply wanted to add that after I had my son, I remember traveling around and talking to all the other new moms about where you could possibly change a baby in the bathroom without laying them on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2871.003s">[Callahan]</a>: So I hope that we can include that in the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2873.503s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3245.339s">[Callahan]</a>: I just, I hope that we are infrequently asked to waive three readings and that we can- There's not three readings on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3262.245s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3263.926s">[Callahan]</a>: As a general rule, I hope that we are infrequently asked to make quick decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3270.632s">[Callahan]</a>: Apparently this is not waiving three readings, so maybe it is not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3274.354s">[Callahan]</a>: But just wanted to make that short comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3421.155s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3421.996s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to take this opportunity to answer a question that has come up pretty often in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3427.661s">[Callahan]</a>: And that really is a question about why we can't use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3433.166s">[Callahan]</a>: People say that they heard that we have $34 million in free cash and why can't we use that instead of raising taxes, which I think is a very fair question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3441.653s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would like people to consider the way that city budgets and city finances are similar to household finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3450.456s">[Callahan]</a>: When you run a household, you've got income, you've got expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3453.397s">[Callahan]</a>: If you make your operating budget, your normal budget for the year, you want to look at your income and hope that your budget adds up to less than your total income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3462.52s">[Callahan]</a>: And in your household, you probably also have a savings account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3466.85s">[Callahan]</a>: It's good to have a savings account for one time or unexpected expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3471.113s">[Callahan]</a>: Your kid might need braces, your roof might need repair, you might need to get a new car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3475.916s">[Callahan]</a>: Cities also need to have savings accounts for similar reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3478.925s">[Callahan]</a>: At some point, we will need a new fire station, we'll need a new high school, there might be a pandemic and our schools suddenly need HVAC systems to all be replaced at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3487.873s">[Callahan]</a>: The short answer to why we should not use free cash for normal budgeted items is that free cash is savings, and we need it to fix things that are getting older, like buildings or fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3498.328s">[Callahan]</a>: or in case some unexpected emergency happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3501.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, what is free cash exactly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3504.991s">[Callahan]</a>: It is really a dumb name because it's not free and it's not cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3509.032s">[Callahan]</a>: Every year, the city makes a budget and then throughout the year, we spend money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3513.314s">[Callahan]</a>: If we spend less than we budgeted, that amount left over is called free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3518.416s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we budget $180 million and then we spend $172 million, that gives us $8 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3525.439s">[Callahan]</a>: And what's important to understand is that every city is strongly encouraged by the state to have free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3532.021s">[Callahan]</a>: Cities must spend less than their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3534.581s">[Callahan]</a>: If they spend more than their budget, their bond rating goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3537.422s">[Callahan]</a>: Bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3538.002s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like a credit rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3539.203s">[Callahan]</a>: And if your bond rating goes down, then it costs you an arm and a leg in interest and fees to borrow money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3544.784s">[Callahan]</a>: Spending more than you budgeted is a big no-no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3546.784s">[Callahan]</a>: It's a sign that your city is being poorly run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3549.597s">[Callahan]</a>: So yay for Medford that recently we have free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3552.681s">[Callahan]</a>: This has raised our bond rating up to a double A plus rating last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3557.666s">[Callahan]</a>: The division of local services is a state body that helps cities and towns be financially responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3563.331s">[Callahan]</a>: It recommends cities and towns have between three and 5% of their total budget and free cash every year to maintain a good bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3570.979s">[Callahan]</a>: And in Medford, that is between 5 million and 9 million each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3575.383s">[Callahan]</a>: Our $34 million in certified free cash is primarily because we had $9 million in 2023 due to remaining ARPA COVID grant funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3585.309s">[Callahan]</a>: 9 million in 2022 because of unfilled state positions and legal funds not being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3589.831s">[Callahan]</a>: Both of these years are within the recommended three to 5% of our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3596.355s">[Callahan]</a>: Before about 2012, we had almost no free cash each year, which really is a sign of not being managed, financially managed properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3606.78s">[Callahan]</a>: And the state recommends that municipalities create what are called stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3613.877s">[Callahan]</a>: Almost every city and town at the start of 2024, all but four cities and towns out of 351 had at least one stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3624.808s">[Callahan]</a>: We were one of only four that did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3627.33s">[Callahan]</a>: We finally, this year, have created two stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3634.147s">[Callahan]</a>: And what's important to remember, do not use your savings, free cash or stabilization funds for normal operating expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3640.391s">[Callahan]</a>: The division of local services says, quote, free cash should be restricted to paying one-time expenditures, funding capital projects or replenishing other reserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3649.617s">[Callahan]</a>: It recommends that communities adopt a free cash policy that avoids supplementing current year departmental operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3660.705s">[Callahan]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3662.236s">[Callahan]</a>: We are recommended by the state to have a certain amount of money in our stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3668.061s">[Callahan]</a>: For Medford, it's five to 7%, which is what they recommend would be between nine and $13 million in our general stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3680.913s">[Callahan]</a>: And just to understand a little bit about what we might use these stabilization funds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3687.85s">[Callahan]</a>: or free cash for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3689.692s">[Callahan]</a>: We do have, according to our payment analysis, $67 million in essentially road debt because we have not kept our roads up as much as we should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3703.186s">[Callahan]</a>: It costs less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3704.932s">[Callahan]</a>: Each year, if your roads are in good shape, then it costs if your roads are in bad shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3709.196s">[Callahan]</a>: So we need to make sure that we are doing those improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3712.84s">[Callahan]</a>: And then we also have a capital improvement plan, which has recognized $79 million in needs from about 123 projects across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3725.052s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to be pretty clear that when you look at what we are recommended to do by the state in order to be a financially responsible city, that means that we should continue to create a budget that we know we won't exceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3742.564s">[Callahan]</a>: At the end of each fiscal year, we should have between 3% and 5% of that total budget unspent, which is called free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3749.708s">[Callahan]</a>: Those funds can move into our stabilization funds where we can spend them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3754.275s">[Callahan]</a>: properly take care of our city, which will allow us to spend less in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3760.961s">[Callahan]</a>: And of course, we also want to have new growth through more commercial growth and new housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3765.965s">[Callahan]</a>: We already are doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3766.946s">[Callahan]</a>: The last three years have seen Medford's highest new growth in the past two decades, and we will continue to encourage new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3772.911s">[Callahan]</a>: Unfortunately, this is a slow process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3775.053s">[Callahan]</a>: It cannot fix our budget shortfall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3777.415s">[Callahan]</a>: And because of rising costs of schools, insurance, pensions, inflation affecting every department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3782.959s">[Callahan]</a>: and other costs that we cannot control, we need to increase our annual budget, and that means voting yes on the overrides and on the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3790.683s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4194.006s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4481.008s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4484.833s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, we will reconsider severing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4486.915s">[Callahan]</a>: Or no, we will not reconsider severing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4750.748s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm disappointed that I cannot show my support for each of these individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=821.654s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=822.534s">[Callahan]</a>: I totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=823.255s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's important to be involved, and I'm excited for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2542.38s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks Um, yeah, just quickly that I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2549.707s">[Callahan]</a>: puts the work on us and not on the developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2552.209s">[Callahan]</a>: Because the developer will be like, oh, what is it for this neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2555.372s">[Callahan]</a>: Ah, it's fairly simple for this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2557.834s">[Callahan]</a>: It means that we have to do the work in advance, but that the developers may have more simple instructions because there will be neighborhoods where we're not worrying about one thing or another thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3714.721s">[Callahan]</a>: I definitely want to take a look at this doc later with a little more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3720.466s">[Callahan]</a>: First thought is that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3725.171s">[Callahan]</a>: want us to encourage more density within buildings we have a lot of homes that have four or five bedrooms and one person living in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3733.758s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that we want to go ahead and encourage folks to live with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3741.775s">[Callahan]</a>: to relieve our affordable, our sort of housing issues that we have here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3745.836s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that if we're making definitions that we're not sort of defining anything as more than four people living together, it's like a separate sort of definition of living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3756.538s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just wanna be a little bit careful on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3758.698s">[Callahan]</a>: It looks like some of those definitions are like anything more than four and you're defined as a strange form of housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3765.739s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's my only thinking without really having time to sort of look more deeply into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2164.346s">[Callahan]</a>: Just wanted to ask, it does say Monday through Sunday, so seven nights a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2169.11s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you talk a little bit about whether you've seen more demand on weekends, are there certain days that you would like it to be later, other days when it would be earlier, just based on what you've seen, what you think would work best for your business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3335.868s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3337.209s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to mention that I did knock on thousands of doors last summer and fall, and this issue came up really a surprising number of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3347.335s">[Callahan]</a>: How many residents commented that within the first few years after completely repaving a street, that some project would come in and rip up the street again, and that they felt that that was a poor use of city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3363.704s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think this is important that we, as a city, require full repaving of city streets when it is within five years of the paving of a street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3378.208s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sure that it is within the business model of National Grid to fully repave roads that have been from curb to curb that have been paved within the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3391.109s">[Callahan]</a>: simply because that is just a normal process of doing business, doing the kind of business that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3396.974s">[Callahan]</a>: It may also be something that you realize that when a city council has changed personnel, that perhaps you might get a different opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3407.823s">[Callahan]</a>: And that may be your job, but my job is to fight for what the city should be getting in this business contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3416.61s">[Callahan]</a>: And within this business contract, it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3420.965s">[Callahan]</a>: The normal thing, the thing that we need to request is that you do full curb-to-curb repaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3426.207s">[Callahan]</a>: And if the agreement was made in the past, that it makes more sense for both parties for that to be moved to a different street, but that the cost of the repaving is fully reimbursed by National Grid, then I feel very comfortable with that agreement that was made in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3650.75s">[Callahan]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3653.951s">[Callahan]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4088.698s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to comment that I'm incredibly thrilled about the work that Council on Learning has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4102.82s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4105.162s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm thrilled about the work that Councilor Leming has done on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4108.385s">[Callahan]</a>: As I hope people understand, this City Council has really taken the funding of this city very seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4116.372s">[Callahan]</a>: We have been underfunded for a long time, and the linkage fees are one of the few places where we can actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4123.859s">[Callahan]</a>: obtain more funds that does not affect property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4129.904s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is something that I think everyone here should be really excited about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4133.707s">[Callahan]</a>: It has not been updated in 34 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4135.668s">[Callahan]</a>: It is definitely undervalued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4137.029s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a way that we are going to bring income into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4140.572s">[Callahan]</a>: And then these changes that make sure that even if a study is not done regularly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4147.717s">[Callahan]</a>: that we continue to increase those at the price of inflation is truly a fantastic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4153.82s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4155.18s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Leming, for the work that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5008.322s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious if you have any predictions that if you raise it from $0.25 to $0.35, which based on your chart is one of the higher, is a little bit higher than surrounding cities, do you think that that will lead to fewer people charging in Medford or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5049.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5051.101s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much for coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5052.183s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm really excited about the program in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5054.867s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm happy to see that there has been increasing demand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5058.092s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that's a good sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5589.505s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a question, is this out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund or is this out of the, these bonds, are those the bonds that we see coming out of the operating budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=340.869s">[Callahan]</a>: Find them in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=342.97s">[Callahan]</a>: And I move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5281.578s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6723.471s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6724.292s">[Callahan]</a>: It's great to have you here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6725.734s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to see if you had any opinion on the topic that one of the previous speakers mentioned about poison versus population control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6736.277s">[Callahan]</a>: Poison versus population control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6744.602s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7528.912s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lovett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8808.757s">[Callahan]</a>: I plan to vote in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11283.35s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11878.502s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we vote on this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11880.244s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we vote on this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1429.939s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1430.339s">[Callahan]</a>: Just one quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1431.059s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see any mention of spaying or neutering, which I assume is intentional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1435.141s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I totally missed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1436.781s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see any mention of spaying or neutering these feral or stray cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1440.322s">[Callahan]</a>: I assume that's intentional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1441.703s">[Callahan]</a>: It does say vaccinating, but it doesn't mention spaying or neutering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=990.954s">[Callahan]</a>: I also reached out after seeing this, I reached out to the State Auditor and I also reached out to the Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=999.927s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems quite clear from the letter that Councilor Scarpelli wrote that the request in the letter, and he says right here, to examine the issues set forth in said letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1011.134s">[Callahan]</a>: That letter is to address issues that he mentioned, which include whether the chair properly ruled out of order a certain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1027.524s">[Callahan]</a>: state piece of legislation, C43 section 22 of MTL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1035.59s">[Callahan]</a>: When I reached out to the state auditor, what the state auditor said was, our office does not conduct audits of city councils, full stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1050.117s">[Callahan]</a>: We can, however, conduct audits of cities if requested to do so by a city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1055.579s">[Callahan]</a>: So there's something I find very interesting happening here, which is this motion, as written, says that it is to examine the issues set forth in the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1064.883s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm going to tell you right now, the state auditor does not do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1068.725s">[Callahan]</a>: That is what they told me in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1072.727s">[Callahan]</a>: They don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1073.967s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a legal question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1076.095s">[Callahan]</a>: And Councilor Scarpelli seems to think that for some reason, the contracted legal team, KP Law, because they work for the mayor is different somehow from a city solicitor, which also would work for the administration and for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1095.838s">[Callahan]</a>: And I've talked to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1097.239s">[Callahan]</a>: to city councilors from many cities for many years about the fact that city solicitors do work for the administration, and they tend to, you know, have administration centric ideas right that is a totally normal well understood thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1113.686s">[Callahan]</a>: But this idea that somehow if we had a city solicitor, it would not be hired by the mayor, and yet the KP law is hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1121.272s">[Callahan]</a>: And so therefore we should never take the opinion of the legal team that we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1126.536s">[Callahan]</a>: What we need to know and what was in this letter is a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1130.599s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, unfortunately, I did not have time because this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1134.702s">[Callahan]</a>: was sent out on Friday, and I reached out to them on Monday, and today is Tuesday, so I have not yet spoken to the Attorney General, but I am sure that if what we want is a legal opinion from the state, we can get that legal opinion from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1149.691s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, what's interesting is that the motion that Councilor Scarpelli has now stated is not to examine the issues set forth in said letter, which would be essentially to audit the legal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1164.019s">[Callahan]</a>: opinion in the particular legal statements made by the city council, which the state auditor does not do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1175.472s">[Callahan]</a>: But now it is to look at our finances around financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1183.094s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, that is something that the state auditor can financially audit a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1190.356s">[Callahan]</a>: They will charge the municipality, so the taxpayers of Medford will pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1205.791s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would like to ask a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1209.754s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there not a regular audit done of the city every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1214.478s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1215.959s">[Callahan]</a>: There is a regular audit done of the city finances every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1227.827s">[Callahan]</a>: Which I approve of 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1229.489s">[Callahan]</a>: City's finances should be audited every year and they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1603.173s">[Callahan]</a>: I would simply want to understand, because it is not at all clear to me, which of these two things we're actually voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1610.061s">[Callahan]</a>: Are we voting on for the state auditor to examine the issue set forth in said letter, which is what is written, which I'm pretty sure they will not do, because that's not what they do, or are we voting on them to look at our finances<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1621.232s">[Callahan]</a>: which was what Scarpelli said out loud, which we already do every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1626.596s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm really having trouble imagining why we would want to pay the state to do a second audit when we already do them every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1634.241s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would wanna know which of those we're voting on if there's gonna be a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1636.763s">[Callahan]</a>: I am unclear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4192.018s">[Callahan]</a>: I also feel like there are so many responses that I could give.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4195.54s">[Callahan]</a>: It's really not possible to respond to everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4198.622s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, I was sad that your motion was Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4205.345s">[Callahan]</a>: I was going to vote for it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4206.445s">[Callahan]</a>: I was also going to vote for it the week after when it was pulled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4210.447s">[Callahan]</a>: I also want to know the answer to these legal questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4213.368s">[Callahan]</a>: I do not feel as sure as Councilor Tseng that I know exactly what that law states, and I would like an official legal opinion, and I look forward to what the Attorney General says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4227.531s">[Callahan]</a>: I also wish that, as a general rule, financial matters were brought to us earlier so that we were not under the gun and had to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4241.476s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is a situation that we are put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4245.699s">[Callahan]</a>: And while it is accurate to say that some pink slips went out, some pink slips go out every year, and there would have been dozens and many dozens more pink slips if we had not passed what we passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4261.229s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's not accurate to say that it made no difference, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4265.412s">[Callahan]</a>: It made a big difference to our schools, whether we voted that week or the next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4272.577s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't like being, would I like another week or two to be able to look at these financial questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4277.299s">[Callahan]</a>: You bet I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4278.22s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not the one putting these matters to the city council at the absolute last second so that we are forced to vote on them as fast as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4289.465s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4292.095s">[Callahan]</a>: I really wish that I had some miraculous way to know how the 60,000 people in Medford all think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4301.342s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm surprised to hear anyone say that they know how those 60,000 people all think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4306.726s">[Callahan]</a>: I also am really having a lot of trouble understanding how the, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4316.963s">[Callahan]</a>: auditing the way that the overrides were passed because the overrides are a major problem, you know, that our community is not being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4328.792s">[Callahan]</a>: This whole argument really, I'm really struggling with this because, you know, the overrides was a question of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4336.257s">[Callahan]</a>: rule 21 and basically us being able to vote on them that week or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4343.108s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think there's any argument that rule 21 was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4348.577s">[Callahan]</a>: suspended and that whether that was suspended in a way that was legally like okay or not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4354.019s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that simply is unfortunately what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4356.98s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe you don't like the politics of it, but that was voted on properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4360.762s">[Callahan]</a>: And then whether the whole community has listened to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4362.843s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, we're literally allowing the voters for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4365.504s">[Callahan]</a>: We're allowing the voters to be listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4367.745s">[Callahan]</a>: We are allowing them to be listened to for the first time in decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4370.846s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm really struggling with this argument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4374.924s">[Callahan]</a>: or how putting overrides on the ballot so that the community can in fact be listened to by having a democratic vote where everyone can come to the ballot box, how that is not listening to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4387.494s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will also say that all the people, I mean, the wildly overwhelming support of people who came to that meeting and spoke in support of putting the overrides on the ballot, and we're yet being told that we aren't listening to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4402.445s">[Callahan]</a>: That's really struggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4404.807s">[Callahan]</a>: with how that can be when number one, wildly overwhelming support from the community at the meeting where we discussed it, and number two, all we're doing is putting it on the ballot so that we can listen to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4419.639s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, finally, I wanna say that this particular matter, there is no deadline for whether we vote for an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4433.622s">[Callahan]</a>: And I am completely, do not understand what the heck we are auditing, because we are gonna audit everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4441.65s">[Callahan]</a>: We're gonna audit financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4443.572s">[Callahan]</a>: We're gonna audit the management style of the council president, which I pretty much guarantee you the state auditor is not going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4449.518s">[Callahan]</a>: The number of things that have been mentioned that we are auditing, I have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4455.103s">[Callahan]</a>: what this motion is here to say, and I am not gonna vote on a motion to have the state auditor come in and who knows, spend millions of dollars auditing, I don't know, any random thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4466.313s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not a reasonable thing to vote in favor of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6369.801s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it possible to move to table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6373.805s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to move to table because I, here's my reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6377.848s">[Callahan]</a>: I am not confident that the money that we would spend right now would be any different from the yearly audit that we already have done by an independent team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6388.258s">[Callahan]</a>: So until I understand that it would be different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6393.63s">[Callahan]</a>: I cannot vote in favor of this because it would literally just be duplicating work that is already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=201.294s">[Callahan]</a>: Huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=203.616s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep, I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=205.036s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=231.601s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=232.681s">[Callahan]</a>: I didn't hear that you call me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=237.062s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=288.001s">[Callahan]</a>: Whenever you're done, I just, I have two very small changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=356.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I'm having trouble with my mute button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=358.276s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=358.717s">[Callahan]</a>: Just two very small things in the very first paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=363.522s">[Callahan]</a>: I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=364.898s">[Callahan]</a>: I would have us use a word other than elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=367.822s">[Callahan]</a>: I tripped over it when I read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=369.143s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think if we can say we voted to place or, you know, there's other ways to put that I would just use a different word than elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=380.947s">[Callahan]</a>: Because it's easy to read, like, we were elected to place these, you know what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=384.689s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, just another word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=386.11s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the other one is... Sorry, can you, wait, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=398.177s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just change it to voted and then people won't be, they won't trip over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=404.921s">[Callahan]</a>: Ready for my second one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=421.464s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm going off the one that you sent out today, which I thought was the latest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=427.249s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=429.912s">[Callahan]</a>: Why don't I mention my only other thing, and then if you guys already fixed it, then great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=433.235s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=435.637s">[Callahan]</a>: It's under general business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=438.365s">[Callahan]</a>: The first bullet point should be two sentences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=442.347s">[Callahan]</a>: One about the budget and the second one about the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=446.128s">[Callahan]</a>: It's just a little confusing and kind of run on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=449.269s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=451.43s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=492.11s">[Callahan]</a>: It looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=493.251s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=629.287s">[Callahan]</a>: It was Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=630.207s">[Callahan]</a>: It was a Friday, so it was a week ago Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=633.2s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=687.672s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if- I would just state that we did it, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=690.634s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we- because otherwise, like, some people might be offended that their thing didn't get mentioned, and I think it's easier to just say that we met with them and had a fruitful discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=803.653s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I just chime in very quickly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=808.729s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=810.21s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to say that I think an easy way to make it okay for the populations that we're talking to is to have the person who organized it just send them a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=823.797s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't think we're gonna say anything super personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=826.378s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not gonna mention anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=828.059s">[Callahan]</a>: But if we send them a draft and be like, hey, this is what we're gonna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=832.541s">[Callahan]</a>: If you don't let us know by next week, we'll go ahead with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=835.002s">[Callahan]</a>: That at least gives us, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=839.073s">[Callahan]</a>: like allows them to say, oh, you know, they prefer that they that we don't mention that one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1428.766s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1429.507s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I love the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1433.772s">[Callahan]</a>: I think in addition to what we hear from people who already attend the meetings, I would hope that maybe at the top, we put some information for people who have never attended a meeting that simply says, hey, here's how to find out what we're going to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1447.781s">[Callahan]</a>: Here's how to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1449.862s">[Callahan]</a>: Here's what will happen when you come to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1452.163s">[Callahan]</a>: You will have the opportunity to speak for three minutes on any topic, like letting people who've never been know that they are welcome and how they can begin participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1463.663s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1881.012s">[Callahan]</a>: You're confusing him with Kit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1882.632s">[Callahan]</a>: That's Kit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1887.814s">[Callahan]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2025.653s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2027.665s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm now that I'm hearing all these things, I'm envisioning like a table at the front of the hall, the minute people walk in the door, and there's one that says, so it's your first council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2038.327s">[Callahan]</a>: There's another one, like the green one says, so it's your first council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2041.328s">[Callahan]</a>: The blue one says, here's the purview of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2044.429s">[Callahan]</a>: The yellow one says, frequently asked questions from people who have attended council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2050.05s">[Callahan]</a>: Like they're all like separate pages that just cover a sort of one topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2056.013s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe that's going overboard, but that's what once councilors are starting speaking, then I was like, Oh, like, this could be something that people can be like, Oh, which of these is the right, you know, one for me, if we can't put everything on one page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2384.355s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I'm just talking for just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2388.477s">[Callahan]</a>: Tell me tell me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2389.537s">[Callahan]</a>: That's me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2402.622s">[Callahan]</a>: Did you hear me just ask you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2419.853s">[Callahan]</a>: That's cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2421.513s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2423.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Your guess is as good as mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2793.815s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=39.43s">[Callahan]</a>: Everyone in the waiting room is me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=41.111s">[Callahan]</a>: City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=767.027s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=774.63s">[Callahan]</a>: I am present, this is Councilor Cownie and I am present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=777.731s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, we heard and noted you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1806.817s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1808.279s">[Callahan]</a>: So I... Hang on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1815.044s">[Callahan]</a>: Do I sound like I'm getting any feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1817.846s">[Callahan]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1821.383s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1822.885s">[Callahan]</a>: So we have done a little bit of looking at the street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1828.35s">[Callahan]</a>: We had an update from our DPW commissioner and an engineer around where our roads were, and we got a nice view of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1842.222s">[Callahan]</a>: 2024 update of the pavement study, which had originally been done in 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1846.324s">[Callahan]</a>: So we got to see what has been done over the last few years, and we're pretty pleased to understand that they did get utilities to do all of the repaving work that they are supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1861.914s">[Callahan]</a>: So we're going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1863.355s">[Callahan]</a>: We have a few questions with them that are ongoing, and we're going to catch up with them when they have more information about the total look at where the last year or two of funding has come from and how that has been spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1883.923s">[Callahan]</a>: The second piece we're looking at is city facilities and equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1888.665s">[Callahan]</a>: Really, the main thing we did there was because we have a new building commissioner, we have asked them to do a review of all of our public facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1897.649s">[Callahan]</a>: So we will meet with them to go over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1902.951s">[Callahan]</a>: We also have public restrooms and parks and squares that we have not really begun on yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1908.693s">[Callahan]</a>: There is a lead ordinance that we also are going to be looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1913.223s">[Callahan]</a>: a home rule petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks, that also is in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1919.345s">[Callahan]</a>: And this public utility accountability, we have touched on that, especially with the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1927.347s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are sort of on that and making sure that that is moving forward through the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1936.569s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I would say the final thing is to look at the tree planting volunteer network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1942.512s">[Callahan]</a>: So all of these are things that we will be doing, except for the streets and sidewalk repair and the facilities maintenance, which were planned for the first half of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1952.256s">[Callahan]</a>: All of those are happening either the second half of this year or in the second year of the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1317.384s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1662.639s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2566.564s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2567.644s">[Callahan]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2569.765s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that this intersection has been a sore spot for many years, and I look forward to a discussion in the Public Works Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2577.346s">[Callahan]</a>: So I welcome that to come into the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2579.827s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14238.493s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17292.895s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17294.416s">[Callahan]</a>: And thanks for, for all the work that you guys have done to put together these proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17301.08s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to ask a little bit about the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17307.176s">[Callahan]</a>: whether with the general stabilization fund, if that way that it is set up through the recommendations of the state, if that can be spent on capital, if the point of having a separate capital stabilization fund is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17331.818s">[Callahan]</a>: limit the ways that those funds can be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17336.542s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm trying to get to sort of why establish a capital stabilization fund separately from the general stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17344.669s">[Callahan]</a>: And by the way, I am really glad that we're establishing a water and sewer capital stabilization fund, which we desperately need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17351.855s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17455.783s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17456.984s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I just do a short follow-up question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17460.156s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you have any data on how many municipalities or the percentage of municipalities that also have a capital stabilization fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17519.879s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17535.457s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, could you re-read the B motion, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.235s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19166.636s">[Callahan]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19169.901s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess I have a second, I hesitate on two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19175.625s">[Callahan]</a>: One is that I think that the cost of living in Medford is going up more than 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19183.61s">[Callahan]</a>: So for non-union employees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19190.967s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, my general understanding of salaries in Medford is that they are across the board too low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19197.269s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do look forward to us receiving and reviewing the overview of how we compare to nearby cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19210.952s">[Callahan]</a>: But, you know, I mean, I'm happy to give a raise, but I also hesitate to give<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19218.056s">[Callahan]</a>: This to me is not a raise, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19219.437s">[Callahan]</a>: It's clearly not a raise, it's a COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19221.959s">[Callahan]</a>: But even at a COLA, I would like to see us being commensurate with other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19232.487s">[Callahan]</a>: And then secondly, also, I'm not totally convinced that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19241.445s">[Callahan]</a>: As well, looking, you know, I, I probably should spend a little time reviewing mayor salaries and nearby cities of similar size and all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19253.011s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think you simply say it's 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19255.052s">[Callahan]</a>: I also don't think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19258.514s">[Callahan]</a>: current pay of the person who sits in the mayor's chair, given the two positions that they are legally required to sit in, and the pay that they get from both of those is not a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19269.878s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that can be argued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19272.959s">[Callahan]</a>: So I do have two points of hesitation on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19672.093s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.112s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.473s">[Callahan]</a>: So it seems to me that really, if we're just talking about timeline the most important thing is we don't choose to do one thing first, that we will realize when we then look at something else, but those are conflicting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3114.291s">[Callahan]</a>: So, things like for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3117.615s">[Callahan]</a>: creating more affordable housing and the natural environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3120.558s">[Callahan]</a>: Like if we're gonna be like zoning, great, we're gonna zone everywhere for tons of housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3123.9s">[Callahan]</a>: And then we're like, oh, when we get to natural environment, we're like, oh crap, like we forgot that we actually meant to also prioritize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3132.968s">[Callahan]</a>: So can we just look to see which ones could conflict with each other and make sure that we look at those at the same time or close to each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3279.225s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.225s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.766s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to follow up on the point I was making and see if our planning department has any particular thoughts on that question, because I'm not convinced that the rating system that they came up with covers what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3294.955s">[Callahan]</a>: So for example, if we're like affordable housing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3297.841s">[Callahan]</a>: We're gonna do that first and then mitigating heat islands is gonna be last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3301.864s">[Callahan]</a>: Those could in fact be in conflict with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3304.205s">[Callahan]</a>: Whereas I think 18 hour communities and balanced growth are less in conflict with each other, but I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3309.428s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wanted to ask and see if you just have any initial thoughts that you could put in on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3316.993s">[Callahan]</a>: If any of these goals are things that if we don't consider them at the same time, we might regret it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4342.776s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4344.257s">[Callahan]</a>: I just have four that I would say are from my four priorities, housing, the 18 hour community and specifically creating walkable neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4353.946s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, little neighborhood centers, and then buildings and energy but really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4362.674s">[Callahan]</a>: like two thirds of our emissions come from buildings, and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4368.538s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not really focused on the new building stuff, but anything we can do for existing buildings, which I know is not easy and zoning and the natural environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4377.624s">[Callahan]</a>: So those would be my four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4378.544s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=36.036s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=151.654s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=288.935s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2037.76s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6428.629s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6429.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor, for being here, for all the work that you have done on the budget and providing us with the information early, and also on working on these proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6441.02s">[Callahan]</a>: People who know me will know that I believe two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6445.344s">[Callahan]</a>: One, I believe in democracy, and two, that I believe that this city has been underfunded for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6452.671s">[Callahan]</a>: So...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6456.585s">[Callahan]</a>: to the first point, again, as Councilor Tseng mentioned, we are not voting to approve of these monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6464.594s">[Callahan]</a>: We are voting to allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6467.13s">[Callahan]</a>: the people of Medford to make this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6470.592s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6473.094s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, that is the most important thing, is that we not, the only thing that we could do now, tonight, that would be the most undemocratic thing to do, would be for us to refuse to allow the voters to make this decision, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6490.145s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be undemocratic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6492.086s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's my first point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6499.835s">[Callahan]</a>: My second point is about the chronic underfunding of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6504.619s">[Callahan]</a>: And while I certainly am all for new growth, I think it simply doesn't add up if you look at the reality of the funding of the city and at what we need in order to not be financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6522.523s">[Callahan]</a>: The problem is that costs rise faster than Prop 2.5 allows us to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6530.205s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we simply look at the budget, we can see that in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6533.426s">[Callahan]</a>: So the largest portion of the budget is our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6537.267s">[Callahan]</a>: The second largest portion of the budget is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6539.847s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6541.548s">[Callahan]</a>: We do not have any control over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6543.468s">[Callahan]</a>: It is going up higher than we are allowed to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6546.249s">[Callahan]</a>: The third one is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6549.191s">[Callahan]</a>: Pensions we also do not control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6550.872s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are the top three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6552.554s">[Callahan]</a>: After that come police and fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6555.516s">[Callahan]</a>: And the fourth one after that is roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6559.278s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to talk about roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6561.36s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want people to understand that these costs, many of them are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6565.603s">[Callahan]</a>: They are uncontrollable by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6568.705s">[Callahan]</a>: And they're going up faster than we are allowed to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6572.608s">[Callahan]</a>: So this simply is something that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6576.331s">[Callahan]</a>: It's math, you cannot make those numbers match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6580.795s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to talk about roads because we had a great meeting with the Commissioner, the DPW and one of the engineers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6589.123s">[Callahan]</a>: There was a roads assessment done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6590.605s">[Callahan]</a>: If people have not looked at that roads assessment done in 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6595.129s">[Callahan]</a>: It basically said that, so the grade roads, they call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6599.531s">[Callahan]</a>: I like to call them A, B, C, D, and F, because everybody understands grades that we get in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6606.655s">[Callahan]</a>: 49% of our roads in 2021 were rated D or F, the worst two possible qualities of roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6615.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, it costs 50 times as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6618.962s">[Callahan]</a>: to bring a road from F to A as it costs to bring a road from B to A. So the problem is if you are simply not spending enough on your roads every single year that you're allowing roads to get to be D and F, that is unbelievably financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6637.057s">[Callahan]</a>: because the amount of money it takes to then repair those roads is like 30 to 50 times more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6643.682s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is years of underfunding our roads that has led us to this place and it is financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6657.192s">[Callahan]</a>: We came out of COVID and during COVID, students everywhere suffered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6665.063s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered mental health issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6666.924s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered academic issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6668.905s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered from family issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6672.066s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is a reality that our students, all of our students in our schools are facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6676.728s">[Callahan]</a>: They need more supports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6679.649s">[Callahan]</a>: That is just a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6683.231s">[Callahan]</a>: And the other thing about schools is that we have school buildings that have not been properly maintained, that the money to properly maintain them has not been spent in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6694.796s">[Callahan]</a>: That means that we are in debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6696.217s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are in road debt, we are in school debt, we are in school support debt, we are in trees debt, and I'm glad we planted 200 trees, but it is my understanding, and this is colloquially that I have heard through the grapevine, we do not have actual study yet, it's not completed, but my understanding is we lose more than twice as many trees every year as we plant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6715.885s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are in tree debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6718.186s">[Callahan]</a>: We are in debt in terms of the salaries because we do not, our salaries are not commensurate with other cities, surrounding cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6726.848s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that means is that it is incredibly difficult now for us to fill positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6734.31s">[Callahan]</a>: We have turnover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6736.25s">[Callahan]</a>: This is financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6740.27s">[Callahan]</a>: So the problem is not, like the problem that we have, new growth, there is no city in the world that could create the new growth needed to fill these gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6752.118s">[Callahan]</a>: These gaps are real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6755.821s">[Callahan]</a>: They are due to many things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6759.143s">[Callahan]</a>: And I believe that the proper thing to do is to allow our community to make the decision through democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6771.732s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.11s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.43s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to mention one thing for folks concerned about seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8956.133s">[Callahan]</a>: We also have in Medford, there is something that people can request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8960.275s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're a senior, you can request that you can be exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8963.718s">[Callahan]</a>: In fact, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, from all of your, up to all of your taxes, and that can be until your property is sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8971.123s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is something that seniors in Medford have the option of doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8975.185s">[Callahan]</a>: So we hope that this Prop 2.5 override will not negatively impact folks in their day-to-day living expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14963.578s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess my only, not knowing very much about this, my only comment is that I will admit I do not quite understand what this actually does and if it restricts the ability for people to speak in a certain way or, like, I'm just trying to understand what this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14979.978s">[Callahan]</a>: actually changes material for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16680.636s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=9.542s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1600.183s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5800.228s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6247.0s">[Callahan]</a>: No<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=896.937s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=898.058s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you mind sending, because I'm not sure if I have access to this document and with OML, but I probably shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=904.383s">[Callahan]</a>: But if you can, I would love to send the ability to sign up the sign up form to folks that I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=912.691s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you can send that bitly link out, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=916.874s">[Callahan]</a>: And I did have one and only one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=920.797s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=921.658s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much to Councilor Lazzaro for writing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=926.68s">[Callahan]</a>: And I enjoy the exclamation points and the this is very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=932.002s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's a lovely personal touch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=935.384s">[Callahan]</a>: I have one suggestion, which is that we do not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=941.138s">[Callahan]</a>: say, we make statements like this is popular legislation in Medford and many residents spoke in favor of the resolution simply because, you know, it is my experience having talked to city councilors across the country and also looked at a lot of studies on, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=961.463s">[Callahan]</a>: what happens inside city council chambers and who emails and you know talks to their legislators and who is usually left out of that conversation that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=974.375s">[Callahan]</a>: just because people appear at the city council chamber and make a statement does not mean that it is popular in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=981.22s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think we should not be stating as a city council, this is popular in the city, because I think it's not a fair statement for us to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=990.806s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would just recommend that we don't make statements like that in the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=995.229s">[Callahan]</a>: I think people who disagree might be unhappy that we are making this as a blanket statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1004.295s">[Callahan]</a>: That's just kind of overall, I think that we should probably refrain from using those kinds of commentary about popularity of stuff in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1374.209s">[Callahan]</a>: I have a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1378.162s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we just, at the April 30th meeting, the final vote was taken to make the budget ordinance law, make that the first bullet point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1385.904s">[Callahan]</a>: Even though it, you know, things may be slightly out of chronological order, nobody cares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1391.685s">[Callahan]</a>: I think people just need to understand what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1396.686s">[Callahan]</a>: So make that the first bullet point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1400.051s">[Callahan]</a>: At the end of that bullet point, have our one sentence about what it is, and then the next bullet can say, in anticipation, we met many times to hear a city department's budget proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1415.265s">[Callahan]</a>: Or in alignment with the budget ordinance, we met many times in committee of the whole to hear city department budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1434.832s">[Callahan]</a>: Redundant, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1439.794s">[Callahan]</a>: To the law, and so the sentence at the end of that first bullet point can be something like, this new ordinance requires that the city council and public be more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1459.986s">[Callahan]</a>: be involved earlier in the budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1464.568s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that fair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1465.068s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you want to say more than that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1605.404s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1606.224s">[Callahan]</a>: I just did want to mention that I have to leave at 10 after, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1611.446s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wanted to ask, I'm fine with the newsletter as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1616.227s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know whether other folks are ready to vote on that, but I would ask that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1625.589s">[Callahan]</a>: That I can make a motion to disband the subcommittee on listening sessions today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1631.213s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I think, as we discussed earlier, that it does make the scheduling part very difficult for the listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1638.958s">[Callahan]</a>: So that would be my request that we'd be able to do that before eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1659.195s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, sorry, I thought that we were specifically going to do it at this meeting but maybe I was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1862.081s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1866.8s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I move that the chair can always add the links in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1871.062s">[Callahan]</a>: Any links that the chair deems necessary, the chair can always add those links that are relevant and necessary into the final document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1889.231s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, to approve the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1892.793s">[Callahan]</a>: As amended, as edited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1897.554s">[Callahan]</a>: And keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1898.895s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1698.859s">[Callahan]</a>: So the other one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1700.423s">[Callahan]</a>: That part I understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1701.625s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe I'm not understanding the other one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1702.928s">[Callahan]</a>: It's two different lots, but they share one wall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1705.493s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1705.914s">[Callahan]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2968.234s">[Callahan]</a>: So I know that the same way that we don't want height things into the zoning definitions, we probably also don't want hours in the zoning definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2980.162s">[Callahan]</a>: But I will say that when I think of a neighborhood cafe and about zoning and having neighborhood cafes in more closer to residential neighborhoods,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2988.727s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think of ours as part of the reason why a cafe is more acceptable than an eating establishment, than a dinner place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2998.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Because a dinner place is going to be open until 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3002.331s">[Callahan]</a>: A cafe, you know, big closed by 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3004.992s">[Callahan]</a>: So I don't know where that belongs or if it just doesn't belong at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3009.916s">[Callahan]</a>: But I just wanted to mention that in terms of, it does seem to me to be related to zoning in terms of where we might want to have places that are open late at night and where we might not want to have places that are open late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4043.992s">[Callahan]</a>: I really do, given what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4047.414s">[Callahan]</a>: I think having two frontages and a primary and a secondary makes a lot more sense because of the sort of spacing that will happen between front lines and the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4061.641s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that would really help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5213.184s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5213.484s">[Callahan]</a>: Did you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5214.165s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=523.409s">[Callahan]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=525.029s">[Callahan]</a>: As a newbie councilor, there are a number of canine services, canine workers maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=530.592s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=33.684s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to check in on something, which is, I do have a, I have a workshop, an old workshop that I used to give on how to do these kinds of listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=45.694s">[Callahan]</a>: So I haven't sent it because I'm like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=47.416s">[Callahan]</a>: Is your mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=49.197s">[Callahan]</a>: It is on, but I'm not talking to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=52.48s">[Callahan]</a>: I've just been thinking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=58.105s">[Callahan]</a>: uh, not getting in trouble with, uh, bidding law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=61.969s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, I guess what I should do is send a copy to you and the clerk, and then it'll get distributed at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=69.796s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that the appropriate thing to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=71.398s">[Callahan]</a>: It's just like how to run one of these sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=93.254s">[Callahan]</a>: and that works for open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=126.706s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=142.398s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, and then I will look it over before I send it, because I know it's not exactly designed for what we're doing, but it's kind of like a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=153.064s">[Callahan]</a>: general like how-to designed for local electoral politics generally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=163.69s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes and and part of that is gonna and I think part of what is recommended in because it's really designed for like one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=171.934s">[Callahan]</a>: City Councilor or one like Mayor or somebody to run them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=176.339s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I think one of the things we probably will not adhere to very closely is that really the meetings are designed to be not public, not open to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=188.474s">[Callahan]</a>: They're designed to be like safe spaces for a specific community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=192.659s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think we will not be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=194.981s">[Callahan]</a>: We will have ours be more public, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=198.865s">[Callahan]</a>: But the idea that if you really want to understand, for example, the Haitian community, you go to a Haitian church, you don't have it be like any random person from Medford could show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=210.275s">[Callahan]</a>: You have it be like a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=212.157s">[Callahan]</a>: of people that knows each other and you know in a place where they usually congregate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=218.642s">[Callahan]</a>: So what we're doing is going to be a little bit different but I think it'll also be, it'll still have a little bit of that kind of flavor of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=227.808s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, a space where people feel comfortable because we're going to go through the community liaisons, we'll have it like at the senior center because we're going to these places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=235.371s">[Callahan]</a>: I think, you know, it will lend itself a little bit more towards people opening up, which is the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=241.533s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like for people to feel comfortable that they can open up about what their lives are like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=258.784s">[Callahan]</a>: And if I apologize, I was just realizing I didn't really answer your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=262.406s">[Callahan]</a>: Your question was more about the gist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=263.426s">[Callahan]</a>: And I said what we weren't going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=264.727s">[Callahan]</a>: But the gist is the purpose is not for us to be like, here are policies that we want to know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=270.869s">[Callahan]</a>: The purpose is really for us to ask more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=276.437s">[Callahan]</a>: general questions about what their lives are like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=280.518s">[Callahan]</a>: But ideally, we've talked to someone in that community beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=284.62s">[Callahan]</a>: We've had a conversation, like whoever's going to facilitate a conversation talks to somebody beforehand who can say like, hey, this community is probably going to want to talk about X, Y, or Z. So we have some idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=296.644s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not just sort of randomly asking questions about their lives, but we know a little bit about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=301.586s">[Callahan]</a>: And let me just give one example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=306.007s">[Callahan]</a>: before COVID, I was running a campaign for, you know, the first couple of months before COVID hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=313.549s">[Callahan]</a>: And then COVID hit and I couldn't do these listening sessions, but I did get a chance to speak to someone from a particular community who, and you know, it was, I was wishing that I could have a listening session, but I didn't end up having one because of COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=330.093s">[Callahan]</a>: But the person that I talked to really helped me to understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=334.25s">[Callahan]</a>: Most of the people in that community were health care workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=338.712s">[Callahan]</a>: Many of them were working with the elderly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=341.693s">[Callahan]</a>: And so the impact on that community of COVID specifically was really devastating because the number of their patients who were dying, the number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=354.332s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, the other people that they knew who were also, you know, nurses and caretakers who were dying of COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=362.394s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, it was really an eye-opener for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=366.075s">[Callahan]</a>: And to think about like how to ask those questions and really understand like what could be done from a policy perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=373.337s">[Callahan]</a>: And obviously that's like a, that was a critical time and a really unusual thing, but I wouldn't have known<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=381.181s">[Callahan]</a>: about that particular aspect if I hadn't talked to someone who knew that community really well first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=386.806s">[Callahan]</a>: So knowing sort of what to ask is always good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=390.089s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think with the community liaisons especially, we'll be able to talk to the liaisons themselves and maybe get some of that from those folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=398.897s">[Callahan]</a>: It'll be easy because they work for the city and we have access to those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=402.721s">[Callahan]</a>: So that'll be a nice conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=466.1s">[Callahan]</a>: So I actually would, I think that the senior center is a really good opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=472.202s">[Callahan]</a>: As I was talking to seniors on the campaign trail, I'm sure you also have like stories on the campaign trail, you know, we all do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=478.544s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, they had very particular concerns that are things we can address, concerns about transportation specifically, like how to get from one part of the city to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=486.807s">[Callahan]</a>: Folks in West Medford talked about the, you know, commuter rail,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=491.028s">[Callahan]</a>: not being ADA compliant, like at that one particular place and how difficult that made their ability to use that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=499.29s">[Callahan]</a>: Obviously, we don't have control of the commuter rail, but as city councilors, it is something that we can, you know, push the state legislators for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=507.292s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I wouldn't go in and talk about whether they have job opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=511.392s">[Callahan]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=511.813s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, there are things you do and don't talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=513.693s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think, you know, it can definitely be tailored toward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=519.471s">[Callahan]</a>: seniors and talking specifically and asking them questions to sort of bring out like, how is Medford serving you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=530.238s">[Callahan]</a>: We're at the senior center, so we don't want to get them complaining about the senior center itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=535.062s">[Callahan]</a>: So we want to be delicate about that particular aspect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=539.705s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think there are a lot of things that Medford can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=544.734s">[Callahan]</a>: And even maybe some conversations, I know like Arlington, because I met my mom, they have a really great like senior, you know, I forget what they call it, but it's like the senior center, it's like a community center for elderly, Council on Aging or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=563.698s">[Callahan]</a>: And they have tons of programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=565.439s">[Callahan]</a>: I've heard seniors talk about lack of programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=568.982s">[Callahan]</a>: They want to talk about the sidewalks, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=571.504s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, so I think there are like very directed questions that we can have to understand how Medford can serve seniors better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=581.953s">[Callahan]</a>: And it's a really, I think it's a great one to try out this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=588.118s">[Callahan]</a>: targeted, facilitated conversation rather than just a chitchat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=591.88s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I would do if I were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=685.387s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=686.528s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, it is designed for like one elected official to be doing these rather than like a group that so therefore no open meeting law, you know, we don't, it doesn't consider any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=698.198s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, let me just take a peek.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=713.334s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, wonderful, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=715.594s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, that makes me happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=743.408s">[Callahan]</a>: Hang on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=782.667s">[Callahan]</a>: I love that idea that one person is the point person and they're the facilitator and they meet with the person beforehand to figure out what the question to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=893.527s">[Callahan]</a>: I really believe that we would actually, after this meeting, where I think we should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=900.441s">[Callahan]</a>: Like I like your suggestion about one person kind of owning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=904.544s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we should also maybe divvy up the work tonight for how to reach the different, it's only nine groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=910.147s">[Callahan]</a>: We just split it up between the three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=912.509s">[Callahan]</a>: And after that, I would actually really like to disband this subcommittee because I think it makes it very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=919.353s">[Callahan]</a>: No two of us can ever talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=921.535s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that we will have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=923.636s">[Callahan]</a>: more ability to get things done if I can call one of you and say, hey, did you call this person or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=930.48s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, it just makes more sense to me if we disband this after tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1039.556s">[Callahan]</a>: I just sent it to Adam, sorry, the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1046.258s">[Callahan]</a>: So hopefully we can take a little peek at it before we leave today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1184.475s">[Callahan]</a>: Matt, are you getting these extras?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1187.436s">[Callahan]</a>: Putting them on the list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1189.237s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I was- Should we have a spreadsheet or something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1193.258s">[Callahan]</a>: We write these down somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1195.342s">[Callahan]</a>: and the date that we have them on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1196.763s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know, this might be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1247.298s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, so, so far I have- And we can, from this subcommittee, if you want, we can meet with the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1252.663s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, we already have nine groups, so we can, any additions, we can always be like, people committee, we would like to add these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1258.768s">[Callahan]</a>: Vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1260.269s">[Callahan]</a>: And then on it goes, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1298.503s">[Callahan]</a>: And then... Unless she thinks two in different parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1302.327s">[Callahan]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1396.253s">[Callahan]</a>: I would take the nine that we already decided and split them up between the three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1400.334s">[Callahan]</a>: The eight left aside from the three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1403.235s">[Callahan]</a>: Just split them up between the three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1405.096s">[Callahan]</a>: And then just for scheduling purposes, as soon as we talk to somebody, we'll pay you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1412.94s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think they'll overlap naturally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1415.161s">[Callahan]</a>: I think a lot of them will be like, oh, let's do something two, three months from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1418.383s">[Callahan]</a>: And as we're scheduling, we'll have a moment to check in and make sure that they're not too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1459.264s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I thought the three of us are doing all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1461.166s">[Callahan]</a>: Just the three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1470.696s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm happy to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1472.258s">[Callahan]</a>: I love the community liaison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1479.706s">[Callahan]</a>: The two high school sites and Tufts, that's already three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1513.8s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1515.882s">[Callahan]</a>: And will you send this out in the meeting minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1586.424s">[Callahan]</a>: I will do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1588.166s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll do the Spanish-speaking community liaison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1589.907s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll do the Black African-American community liaison and also the West Medford Community Center and I'll work with both of them to see whether we want one or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1604.157s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I'm happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1605.038s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1611.206s">[Callahan]</a>: Haitian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1615.988s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean... Yeah, I think he thought you said Asian-American, but you probably said Haitian-American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1621.17s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, okay, okay, that was... Yeah, that's the confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1623.171s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, so, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1623.831s">[Callahan]</a>: So Haitian is you, unless you want to give it to me, either way is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1683.828s">[Callahan]</a>: I would also mention that like I have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1686.269s">[Callahan]</a>: where I've had a long ongoing conversation with Kuliyan from the Bangladeshi community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1693.253s">[Callahan]</a>: He is supposed to be working on setting up one of these for me, a listening session literally just like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1698.476s">[Callahan]</a>: And so, you know, if we want to, I think we loop him in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1701.978s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1702.279s">[Callahan]</a>: Because he is interested and already was planning on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1716.788s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1718.129s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1720.272s">[Callahan]</a>: If I am, then maybe you take Haitian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1722.314s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1722.674s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1734.486s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1734.746s">[Callahan]</a>: Unless you want to do the Haitian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1736.914s">[Callahan]</a>: I know Whomiyoon and also Foxy and Nicole pretty well, so, and I've been talking to Whomiyoon about it, so I'll work with Whomiyoon in ICM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1746.341s">[Callahan]</a>: And also I've been doing the West Country Community Center a bunch, so I'm happy to be doing that one as well as the Aftermarket Community Day event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1796.238s">[Callahan]</a>: Can I super quick talk to you guys through this doc?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1802.861s">[Callahan]</a>: So I actually had to cut out a bunch of other stuff out of this particular document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1806.943s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is like a portion of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1808.084s">[Callahan]</a>: So if there's anything that's like, oh, see the XYZ earlier in this document, it's not there, don't worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1813.646s">[Callahan]</a>: I left in just this little introduction about the model that you will find humorous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1820.29s">[Callahan]</a>: Because it's like, oh, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1823.351s">[Callahan]</a>: We're on a slate of candidates on a single platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1825.553s">[Callahan]</a>: They're like, oh yeah, I recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1828.195s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I also left in what is called the pitch, just because, I don't know why I left it in there, but I know it happens later, I mention it later, so I think that's why I left it in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1839.524s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyway, starting on page four is where we start talking about the continuous time hauls, and you can see that before doing it, you choose the constituency, you contact the group leader, you set a time and location,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1850.691s">[Callahan]</a>: And then you work with that group's leadership to come up with questions, right, that relate to the concerns of the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1856.413s">[Callahan]</a>: And then at the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1864.213s">[Callahan]</a>: That's why it's not really like, we fit it into like a raising small dollar donations workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1871.941s">[Callahan]</a>: It was one of the pieces, including like house parties were another piece, there were different other pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1876.845s">[Callahan]</a>: So just don't worry about that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1879.728s">[Callahan]</a>: Like I said, I would have pulled all that stuff out, but in this particular case, it's more just for the part that's like starting at page four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1896.463s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1897.244s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1897.564s">[Callahan]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1899.766s">[Callahan]</a>: I will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1901.207s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, but like a short intro, so people kind of understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1905.578s">[Callahan]</a>: And then it should really be 70% listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1909.041s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do think that, like, you know, this sort of 30% helping to educate people, because a lot, like, the idea is that a lot of these people, maybe if they don't vote in city politics, have no idea what, how it even might affect their lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1924.414s">[Callahan]</a>: And so helping them to sort of understand how they can become more involved in the community, how can they become more involved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1929.98s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, politically and people that they know can run for office or get involved like that, I think is a helpful part of it if it comes up, but we don't have to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1977.319s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1979.22s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, to disband this committee, I think is not a bad idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5230.975s">[Callahan]</a>: I just have a general question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5232.075s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that we're having a tree inventory done, and I've come to understand that we probably lose more trees than we plant each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5241.939s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you have a dream for the forestry department that would allow us to plant as many trees as we lose each year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5322.83s">[Callahan]</a>: And just to follow up, do you know when we'll get the geometry and the vulnerability assessment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5975.427s">[Callahan]</a>: The compost, you say you're building a list, and currently we have a relationship with Is It Garbage to Garden?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5984.153s">[Callahan]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5985.253s">[Callahan]</a>: And is that how the list is built, is through them, or is there also a separate list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6035.607s">[Callahan]</a>: And so just so that I understand, that is through Garbage to Garden that we're doing our long-term compost project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6041.192s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not going to end up being in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6832.525s">[Callahan]</a>: So is this the fund out of which we have to repair all of our 120-year-old pipes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6843.113s">[Callahan]</a>: And I apologize for this newbie question, but where in here am I looking for an increase because we got to start repairing these pipes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6853.515s">[Callahan]</a>: Which budget item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6976.599s">[Callahan]</a>: And if I hope you don't mind if I just follow up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6979.301s">[Callahan]</a>: So we're trying to wrap our heads around an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6985.465s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=6988.117s">[Callahan]</a>: You're saying if we had sort of in-house people, which I imagine is because you say it's part of a plan for the future, like that is really how a city would normally be run is you're using this budget to make sure that you maintain all of the lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7004.05s">[Callahan]</a>: So is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7007.247s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, should I be looking in this budget for like us at least beginning to do some of that work this year, this fiscal year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7013.371s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7108.914s">[Callahan]</a>: And then my final question, I think, is about retained earnings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7112.776s">[Callahan]</a>: Retained earnings, by that, do you mean what enters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7119.994s">[Callahan]</a>: the enterprise fund from the rates that is not spent in that fiscal year, that that should be something that we are, you know, sort of filling that bucket year by year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7131.004s">[Callahan]</a>: And is that something I can see here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7135.208s">[Callahan]</a>: Or is this really just a budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7136.469s">[Callahan]</a>: So we're not seeing sort of what is being retained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9473.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2515.924s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2517.145s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited that you and Councilor Leming are bringing this to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2521.769s">[Callahan]</a>: I have many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2522.93s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited to get into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2524.912s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm also excited that we have this section where it's clearly marked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2529.035s">[Callahan]</a>: This is simply what we're referring to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2531.417s">[Callahan]</a>: I will save all of my questions for committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4721.51s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, really thank you for not just your flexibility, but your creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4726.212s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm excited for you to explore having your own drivers where I think you can keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4731.82s">[Callahan]</a>: more of the proceeds here in the city of Medford amongst you and your employees as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4737.682s">[Callahan]</a>: So I love the creativity of that idea and thank you so much for that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6070.137s">[Callahan]</a>: I will try to find that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6071.598s">[Callahan]</a>: I did find the exact number, 2129.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6110.897s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, it was quite shocking to realize that it has been the practice of cities, at least has occasionally happened that they seize entire property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6121.052s">[Callahan]</a>: for a small amount of debt and then keep the profits, keep the rest of what they sell that probably for the sins, utterly absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6130.121s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am in support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6131.902s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say that as I was canvassing, I remember talking to someone who lived next door to a micro lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6140.41s">[Callahan]</a>: that the city had appropriated from a, this was the story, so this is not verified, but this was from a resident saying that the micro lot between their house and their neighbor's house was something that the city had taken<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6155.701s">[Callahan]</a>: because of past due taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6159.124s">[Callahan]</a>: And that it then was an eyesore filled with weeds and rats that worked with their nearby residents to try to come up with some sort of plan to purchase it from the city and the city refused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6170.072s">[Callahan]</a>: So at some point in time, Medford had been taking portions of lots<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6177.901s">[Callahan]</a>: to instead of back taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6181.303s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will also say that even if I'm happy to hear that the court has now determined this is not lawful, but even if the city of Medford is not currently doing something, administrations change, and it is important that we ensure that this is not allowed to happen in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=7304.69s">[Callahan]</a>: The same rate as all residents, homeowners, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=6.0s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=404.923s">[Callahan]</a>: Could you just talk a little bit more about the data processing, what it covers, what the systems are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2106.37s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2110.573s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2111.254s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you both so much for being here and for all the work that you do all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2114.917s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious, again, one of the newer city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2119.084s">[Callahan]</a>: about how the estimates for court time work looks like from 40 to 60K and just curious about how you budget for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1073.165s">[Callahan]</a>: Did we feel that it was discussed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1074.366s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I had questions about the first one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1077.108s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1078.088s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1081.631s">[Callahan]</a>: For the multifamily dwelling, I visited a property in Medford that was two buildings, a single family and a two family on the same property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1094.319s">[Callahan]</a>: The owners lived in the single family, and they rented out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1096.854s">[Callahan]</a>: both those two families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1097.855s">[Callahan]</a>: And according to this, that would not count as a multifamily dwelling because it says two or more buildings on the same lot with more than one residential dwelling unit in each building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1109.04s">[Callahan]</a>: Because one of those was a single family, that whole lot would not count as dwelling multifamily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1115.824s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1262.315s">[Callahan]</a>: So I guess if I could just finish up my question, I'm just curious, like, how much do we need to hash these out here in this meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1272.02s">[Callahan]</a>: Or is, like, before we officially agree on these definitions, like, at what point are we, like, sitting down and saying, okay, do we think that, you know, this is the definition that we want?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1282.185s">[Callahan]</a>: Or do we want it to be more like some rules?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1283.666s">[Callahan]</a>: Or do we, like, when is that appropriate time for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2005.094s">[Callahan]</a>: I found the detached two-unit is Philadelphia-style, because it doesn't share the walls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2021.28s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, above and below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2022.621s">[Callahan]</a>: Philadelphia style just means there's one room of the first floor on the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2025.983s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyway, that doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2027.163s">[Callahan]</a>: But like above and below, I thought was detached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2030.085s">[Callahan]</a>: And duplex is attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2326.404s">[Callahan]</a>: might I suggest that we go through all these other terms that are maybe a little bit, require a little bit less discussion and see if we can get through some, and then we can come back to this, you know, multi-unit definition, which may require more discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3058.786s">[Callahan]</a>: Just an amusing anecdote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3061.328s">[Callahan]</a>: As I was canvassing, I passed by a van, and inside that van, they were washing dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3070.773s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like mobile doggie daycare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3073.795s">[Callahan]</a>: It's so weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3110.425s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say, I believe that the colloquial is doggie daycare and not dog daycare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3115.627s">[Callahan]</a>: I think people say doggie daycare, so I would leave it as doggie because that's what people say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3766.917s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just gonna say, for what you're talking about, which is housekeeping, in the non-housekeeping example, do they each pay the landlord individually rent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3778.284s">[Callahan]</a>: Because that's another way to sort of define it, is to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3783.288s">[Callahan]</a>: Are these people all paying rent as a unit, or is the landlord requiring, like, are these people who don't cooperate, and therefore they each pay separate rent to the landlord?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3794.032s">[Callahan]</a>: That's a little bit more easy to define than housekeeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4092.145s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4092.946s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say this issue is very important to me as someone who has lived in intentional communities for almost my entire life and had difficulty being able to live with other people, being afraid that the landlord will discover that in a four bedroom house, the four of us are unrelated and therefore we're going to be kicked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4110.698s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there's a lot of fear among tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4114.12s">[Callahan]</a>: And yet I also think that the idea of being forced to live with other people that I don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4118.963s">[Callahan]</a>: is horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4120.684s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, what you're surfacing here is exactly has been a lot of my life experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4126.465s">[Callahan]</a>: And so to me, this is an extremely important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4130.326s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really like the way that you're thinking about the things that matter are not the number of people, which is a health department issue, but the things that matter are, do the tenants want to live this way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4144.21s">[Callahan]</a>: Or is the landlord forcing them to live this way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4146.99s">[Callahan]</a>: So I very much appreciate this difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4149.552s">[Callahan]</a>: But whether we define it using housekeeping or define it using separate rents or define it, you know, the way that we determine it, I think can be massaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4161.059s">[Callahan]</a>: But to me, those are the two important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4165.302s">[Callahan]</a>: That is the important difference between the two is like, is this something that tenants are choosing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4169.605s">[Callahan]</a>: And yes, they are fine having, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4172.276s">[Callahan]</a>: one extra person, or if somebody there has a young child, they're fine with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4176.518s">[Callahan]</a>: Or are these people who are really being forced to live together by the landlord?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4179.539s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would want to be able to zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4181.62s">[Callahan]</a>: It doesn't mean that we're saying it can't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4183.46s">[Callahan]</a>: It just means we can zone them and have an awareness of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5435.31s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say I'm particularly fond of tiny homes, given especially how much demand we have for one bedrooms and two bedrooms that we don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5444.074s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think having a definition would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6121.948s">[Callahan]</a>: It says accessory, but it's very clearly a use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6124.21s">[Callahan]</a>: It's like a use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6126.432s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's pretty clear, the exact same word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6129.214s">[Callahan]</a>: So it sounds like you're saying that the not changing the character of the premises of a neighborhood is a standard, and you want to remove that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6459.731s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6460.132s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, but I will have to leave due to family<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6464.215s">[Callahan]</a>: Not quite emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6466.777s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to ask a pre-question before we start discussing the coverage of lot and ask whether we need any kind of a definition of permeable surfaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6475.064s">[Callahan]</a>: If we're going to be adding something in about percentage of lots or amount of permeable surface, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6484.211s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to toss that in there to see if that can be discussed in this last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=188.123s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll just say I did read through the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=190.627s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems pretty comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=191.748s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see any glaring omissions or anything that I would change at this moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=328.481s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not convinced that that is accurate, and I don't want to put that in here in case it is not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=333.484s">[Callahan]</a>: I think open meeting law is open meeting law, and we don't need to write our interpretation of open meeting law into this document, is what I would say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=351.016s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, it is my understanding that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=354.577s">[Callahan]</a>: I, as a city councilor, can post whatever I want on X, like I can say my opinion on X, and it doesn't mean that other city councilors cannot also state their opinions on, and by X, I actually mean X Twitter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=365.941s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm talking about the actual thing, not like a thing with the letter, not the algebra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=373.723s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is why I'm concerned, because if we're putting into this some interpretation of open meeting law that I think may not be applicable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=384.557s">[Callahan]</a>: And it doesn't really matter whether I'm right or wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=386.338s">[Callahan]</a>: It just, I think, matters whether we are 100% legally sure that that is, in fact, accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=393.141s">[Callahan]</a>: And even if it's accurate, we already have opening law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=395.422s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=395.782s">[Callahan]</a>: I just feel like it might be not necessarily and potentially inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=506.953s">[Callahan]</a>: I move to approve the social media guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=514.038s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=514.578s">[Callahan]</a>: I refer it out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1569.295s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, I've been looking for this as a document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1573.096s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have this, was this sent to us or is it the one that's, oh, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1578.438s">[Callahan]</a>: It's sitting right on the desk, looking in electronic form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1581.979s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1620.555s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, could you repeat the motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2590.829s">[Callahan]</a>: would you like Councilor Tseng to go first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2669.622s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so I think just for logistics, we two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2673.786s">[Callahan]</a>: Number one is that we should not have more than two Councilors at each one of these, we should just decide that that is what we're going to do because I think it's impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2684.537s">[Callahan]</a>: to ensure that some policy that is upcoming won't be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2689.839s">[Callahan]</a>: Like that's just the nature of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2692.639s">[Callahan]</a>: And so I think we should just decide no more than two councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2696.74s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the question is, how do we make those decisions from a logistical standpoint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2700.622s">[Callahan]</a>: The other question that I have is, and I know that we, I was the one who proposed that we have a subcommittee, that subcommittee has not met yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2708.484s">[Callahan]</a>: Given that there is a subcommittee, even any two of us on that subcommittee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2713.125s">[Callahan]</a>: cannot appear at the listening session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2715.386s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm wondering if perhaps, given that there's already a listening session later this month, if perhaps tonight we should disband the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2723.669s">[Callahan]</a>: Even though it would be nice to have a subcommittee to discuss this, I think it might be more in the way, given open meeting law, then it will help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2732.092s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe we just have these discussions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2736.713s">[Callahan]</a>: So I will make that as a motion, but I would love to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2739.314s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not, you know, for sure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2741.479s">[Callahan]</a>: that that is the right way to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2913.879s">[Callahan]</a>: Through the chair, I would be super interested in understanding if there are any specific questions, what exactly would be asked of legal counsel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2993.055s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to withdraw withdraw my previous motion and make a different motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=3001.723s">[Callahan]</a>: My new motion is that the chair of resident services committee will appoint which one or two city Councilors would attend each listening session based upon their availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=781.931s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=951.901s">[Callahan]</a>: I did find one error, which I already sent to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=954.323s">[Callahan]</a>: Do I say what that error was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=960.525s">[Callahan]</a>: I do remember, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=970.312s">[Callahan]</a>: Aside from that, I found the records to be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=995.831s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor CUMMING, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1006.394s">[Callahan]</a>: Vice-President Pearce, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1304.67s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1305.73s">[Callahan]</a>: We had the pleasure of having Commissioner Tim McGibbon as well as our engineer Owen Wartella there to discuss our roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1314.094s">[Callahan]</a>: There had been a pavement assessment done in 2021, and we got to see the pavement assessment that was just done recently as an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1323.718s">[Callahan]</a>: We, there were, you know, essentially they talked us through how the roads have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1332.657s">[Callahan]</a>: basically what they have been doing with the roads, which includes coordinating with the utilities when they need to do repairs on the road, making sure that utilities are, in fact, doing all the road repair that they are supposed to be doing, as well as getting all the different kinds of funding that they possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1352.01s">[Callahan]</a>: We are, in fact, repairing roads at approximately... There were five different strategies that were recommended, and we are repairing the roads<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1361.797s">[Callahan]</a>: better than the middle strategy, but not as well as the top strategy because we do not have the funding to do that level of repair to the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1372.861s">[Callahan]</a>: So if there is going to be an improvement in the roads in Medford, it does look like funding will have to increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1382.865s">[Callahan]</a>: It just comes straight out of both of those pavement assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1386.176s">[Callahan]</a>: And that was what we discussed in, oh, they also have, they bought the equipment to do a hot tub crew, to have an internal crew doing road repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1397.604s">[Callahan]</a>: They just need to have to access the funding to be able to staff that, which we think will be less expensive than, for certain levels of repair will be less expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1409.651s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the update for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1532.517s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1604.499s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1605.3s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1606.661s">[Callahan]</a>: Vice-President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1607.562s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2043.651s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2568.53s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3300.532s">[Callahan]</a>: As a city, we are a cash-strapped city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3302.993s">[Callahan]</a>: There are many things, our water pipes, our roads, our schools, I could go on and on, that really require more funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3311.798s">[Callahan]</a>: Property taxes are one of the very few ways that we are able to raise any money, and it seems just not right to me that we ask every homeowner here to pay their property taxes without fail every year, and yet large organizations with billion-dollar<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3329.13s">[Callahan]</a>: endowments do not have to pay anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3332.492s">[Callahan]</a>: The 25% number, as I understand it, was gotten to because that is approximately the amount of services that they use of the city that we do not get any reimbursement for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3346.502s">[Callahan]</a>: I agree that 25% is not enough, but at least it is something, and I'm in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4606.026s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5011.006s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5011.386s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5012.727s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5012.867s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5013.027s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5013.167s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5013.627s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5343.006s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5380.23s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5380.85s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5381.11s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6650.616s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6655.72s">[Callahan]</a>: I have to say, I am trying to understand how we can be discussing the transfer fee when it is not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6667.438s">[Callahan]</a>: And I implore the chair to limit discussion to what is on the agenda, because people need to be noticed publicly so that everyone knows what is on the agenda and what we are discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6682.129s">[Callahan]</a>: This can't be a body where you put something completely vague on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6686.753s">[Callahan]</a>: And I have to say, when I read this, I had no idea what was going to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6695.925s">[Callahan]</a>: We have to know, and the public needs to know, what is on the agenda, so that people who are interested in talking about that topic can come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6718.451s">[Callahan]</a>: Second, I would like to say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6737.603s">[Callahan]</a>: back to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6871.139s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to just make a comment that it seems that people do misunderstand the subcommittee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6878.405s">[Callahan]</a>: So, since this is what is on the agenda, I would like to discuss the subcommittee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6884.729s">[Callahan]</a>: That is, that when we are going to begin to discuss<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6890.382s">[Callahan]</a>: some piece of legislation, for example, that before we can come in with all the wording ready, set, go, we have to give it a paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6902.486s">[Callahan]</a>: So we bring it to this body for it to get a paper number so that it can be discussed in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6910.789s">[Callahan]</a>: That is the way that we do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6913.53s">[Callahan]</a>: And then it will be discussed in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6915.311s">[Callahan]</a>: Committees are open to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6917.191s">[Callahan]</a>: They are held right here in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6919.753s">[Callahan]</a>: any member of the public may come, they may be part just as in city council meetings, they can be part of the discussion where we craft the language together as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6932.517s">[Callahan]</a>: That may take one committee meeting, it may take more than one committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6939.439s">[Callahan]</a>: It will then, especially if it is an ordinance or some larger piece, it will be required to have three hearings, three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6951.693s">[Callahan]</a>: here at the city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6956.215s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am somewhat confused as to why what was said that was my description that this was the beginning of a process is being questioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6967.84s">[Callahan]</a>: It is definitely the beginning of a, this is what subcommittee, subcommittee, but committee process is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6974.863s">[Callahan]</a>: You get a paper number, it goes to committee, it gets discussed openly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6978.644s">[Callahan]</a>: with the public in committee, that is where language can be drafted, and then it comes to this body, and there are still public hearings in this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7019.932s">[Callahan]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7020.512s">[Callahan]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7578.595s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7579.896s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to comment that what I described as the process is for ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7584.7s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not necessarily for resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7586.742s">[Callahan]</a>: Resolutions don't have to go through three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7589.724s">[Callahan]</a>: Different things that we pass through this body have different requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7594.508s">[Callahan]</a>: I certainly was not under the impression that the newsletter had a paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7598.712s">[Callahan]</a>: Each individual monthly newsletter has its own paper number, and therefore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7603.095s">[Callahan]</a>: must come out of committee and then be discussed in this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7606.697s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm happy to do that if that is what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7609.718s">[Callahan]</a>: But I did think that that committee had the ability to pass a newsletter, since it's simply a thing that is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7619.822s">[Callahan]</a>: I totally appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7621.143s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm very happy to change that understanding of mine and to have those sent to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7626.365s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not convinced that that would be a great idea, because I think editing, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7632.364s">[Callahan]</a>: hundred and fifty word newsletter in the city council meetings does not seem like a super great use of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7992.281s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope this can be clarifying for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7996.741s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the idea is that we have a discussion as a community about what we would want, whether we want it, what it would look like in terms of a transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8007.849s">[Callahan]</a>: The letter that was signed is for the state to allow us to have that discussion, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8015.534s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, we can discuss it all we want, but we won't be able to- To give us the authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8019.677s">[Callahan]</a>: To give us the authority, right, to have to, once we've had that discussion, to actually pass something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8029.565s">[Callahan]</a>: The idea of like, I think we all want to be able to have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8034.007s">[Callahan]</a>: We've literally not written a single word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8036.688s">[Callahan]</a>: We want to have the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8039.209s">[Callahan]</a>: And that letter doesn't do anything but try to enable us to be able to have the discussion as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10513.289s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10515.971s">[Callahan]</a>: I understand that many constituents oppose a real estate transfer fee and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10522.156s">[Callahan]</a>: know to make an analogy with theft makes it makes it seem like something of conviction uh for or against something i think a much better analogy is a minimum wage law so in california and other states cities can pass any kind of minimum wage law they want to in massachusetts we cannot um i would sign a something at the state level saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10542.95s">[Callahan]</a>: please allow any city or town in Massachusetts to pass any minimum wage that they deem necessary in their own city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10550.215s">[Callahan]</a>: But that doesn't mean that I would want an infinity minimum wage in Medford, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10554.498s">[Callahan]</a>: So you vote, you push for the state to enable you, it's called enabling legislation, to enable you to pass the laws that are correct for your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10563.905s">[Callahan]</a>: And then within your community, you have the discussion about what would be the right minimum wage for Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10570.734s">[Callahan]</a>: And that is the question that we are having, which is, you know, we are about to begin a long discussion, including the public, about what kind of real estate transfer fee might be the right one for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10584.447s">[Callahan]</a>: But that doesn't mean that individual sitting elected officials who also, by the way, have websites that declare that they, you know, people run on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10595.745s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, there are things that are on my website that are issues that I support and I ran on those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10600.227s">[Callahan]</a>: I told people when I was running that I would support those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10604.289s">[Callahan]</a>: That is why I got elected, because those things were on my website at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10608.411s">[Callahan]</a>: And as city councilors and other elected officials to sign in support of the state, allowing communities to make whatever decision they want doesn't mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10619.824s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, I'm gonna support a $500 minimum wage in Medford, even if I think that any community should be able to have any kind of minimum wage they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10626.888s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just think that that analogy-wise, it's a better analogy that we want the state to allow us to make those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10843.314s">[Callahan]</a>: speaker, I appreciate you coming up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11209.664s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to remind everyone that we are discussing the process dealing with possible home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11218.694s">[Callahan]</a>: It is very important to me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11221.28s">[Callahan]</a>: that comments made by constituents who are knowledgeable, who should be heard from, and comments made by members of this committee who also are knowledgeable and who should be heard from, all of those comments should be heard by the public at a meeting where they know that this is going to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11699.096s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11795.801s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12484.972s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12487.813s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=29.761s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, so today we are doing a pavement management plan update, and I want to thank Commissioner Tim McGivern and our engineer Owen Wartella for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=38.744s">[Callahan]</a>: I will go ahead and read the text of the motions that we passed at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=46.727s">[Callahan]</a>: President Bears has moved that we create a new paper in this committee to request an update on, one, the pavement management plan and sidewalk management plan for the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=54.529s">[Callahan]</a>: including the financial plan recommendation that the City adopted based on the pavement and sidewalk management plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=60.354s">[Callahan]</a>: Two, what the City has spent on pavement management and sidewalk management since the plans were released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=65.538s">[Callahan]</a>: Three, how much was spent from authorized bond orders if funds were spent on streets and sidewalks other than those initially listed for the bond orders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=72.343s">[Callahan]</a>: Four, when the pavement and sidewalk management plans may be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=76.046s">[Callahan]</a>: And then Councilor Scarpelli moved to ask the DPW Commissioner<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=80.342s">[Callahan]</a>: to do a cost analysis for road and sidewalk repairs and to request a sidewalk and hot tub crew to do the work in-house and to look at the costs for Luke's sidewalker and to have that be added into the duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=92.913s">[Callahan]</a>: I welcome you and thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=94.715s">[Callahan]</a>: If you would be able to give us kind of the update as requested, that would be fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=152.462s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think maybe a little bit of understanding of the five strategies and which one of those strategies we've been following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=161.369s">[Callahan]</a>: If you can go a little bit into that, that'd be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=645.179s">[Callahan]</a>: You're talking about both the year 2021, year 2022, year 2023, that all of those numbers in terms of being able to sort of calculate what we spent, that all of those are ones that you're working on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=661.102s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we're looking at what was spent each year, and you're saying that these calculations really haven't been done before, are you working on those from years starting with the 2021 pavement management study?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=675.008s">[Callahan]</a>: Or are you just talking about the last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1285.745s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1290.428s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, I think we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1332.517s">[Callahan]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1332.837s">[Callahan]</a>: We are reconvening, planning and permitting as soon as this meeting is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1337.701s">[Callahan]</a>: Did you call me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1338.842s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=1340.143s">[Callahan]</a>: This meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=151.929s">[Callahan]</a>: It looks like I can't really read all that on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=153.89s">[Callahan]</a>: So some of these may have already been covered by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=158.933s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would say like the leaf flow ordinance, for example, doesn't need to be covered both in the general business as well as in the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=167.678s">[Callahan]</a>: It just might be confusing because it says, like if they only read one, they'll say, they'll think it's a second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=175.242s">[Callahan]</a>: And then under sent to committee, a home rule petition for a real estate transfer fee, that to me is a little too,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=182.319s">[Callahan]</a>: strong sounding, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=184.561s">[Callahan]</a>: It sounds like we sent a home rule petition to commit, like, if I didn't know much about the city council, I would think that there was one completely written up and this language was all finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=195.869s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think the phrasing should be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=199.652s">[Callahan]</a>: Open day discussion or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=201.353s">[Callahan]</a>: Gave a number to, same also with like developing a home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=207.718s">[Callahan]</a>: That's, I don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=209.46s">[Callahan]</a>: exactly what to do with that one, but I think in the same way that governance committee has just a one-liner, we also could put in public works committee as just a one-liner of like currently discussing roads and sidewalks, renovations as, you know, according to the assessment studies, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=231.526s">[Callahan]</a>: Could be a nice simple way of just saying that, hey, this committee is looking at those things, so people care about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=241.991s">[Callahan]</a>: Currently discussing road and sidewalk renovations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=257.382s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't have perfect language for this, but according to the pavement and sidewalk assessment studies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=270.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=281.307s">[Callahan]</a>: Under planning and permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=282.288s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, I would just remove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=285.23s">[Callahan]</a>: I can't tell if Councilor Collins did that already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=300.988s">[Callahan]</a>: And making the language about the... Yeah, the sent to committee a home rule petition for real estate transfer fee, that one, it just, I think it's a little misleading to put it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=978.08s">[Callahan]</a>: You saw it first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1456.6s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1457.942s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, you have the toughest job of doing the first one, getting all of these edits, so I really appreciate all your hard work doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1466.168s">[Callahan]</a>: I do want to mention that if we are going to use email, if we are going to use anything that uses people's phones, which includes text messaging, which includes WhatsApp, which includes Signal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1476.036s">[Callahan]</a>: we have to have opt-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1477.877s">[Callahan]</a>: So the idea that we can't start anything until we somehow have a way to reach everyone, the way that we reach everyone is by producing something, and including, I want to make sure that we have something near the top that says, please forward this information to your friends, or here is how your friends can get on this email list, so that people will send this information to people that they know, and it will be very easy for them once they receive something from a friend or colleague,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1504.728s">[Callahan]</a>: for them to get on the email list or on a mobile list or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1509.35s">[Callahan]</a>: So getting folks to spread the word about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1514.472s">[Callahan]</a>: And then two other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1517.873s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to make sure that with the real estate transfer fee that I think the wording that we chose was really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1525.116s">[Callahan]</a>: I think also for the rent stabilization ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1529.315s">[Callahan]</a>: both of those because they are very hot button issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1532.197s">[Callahan]</a>: We have to make sure that the language is accurate to what has happened, which is we're simply opening the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1539.764s">[Callahan]</a>: So whatever language we're using for the real estate transfer fee, we should use a similar language for the rent stabilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1547.128s">[Callahan]</a>: And then this is a general question, something to think about maybe for next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1551.632s">[Callahan]</a>: I would love it if in our newsletters we can include not only what has happened in the past, but what is upcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1560.279s">[Callahan]</a>: so that maybe even if it's only just that very next week, if we know, so that people can make a plan to come, or even if it just includes maybe a link to the events page that shows people what is upcoming and a thing at the bottom that says if you want to know what we will be discussing in the City Council and in the committee meetings, go to this link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1925.199s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1925.799s">[Callahan]</a>: A few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1926.86s">[Callahan]</a>: Number one, I will second your motion to have you reach out to Mr. Nwaje to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1934.743s">[Callahan]</a>: Second, you also partially answered my question, which is going to be, what is the schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1938.465s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I said I would do whatever was free, so I have no idea what month I'm on, but at least I'm not next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1945.207s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1945.828s">[Callahan]</a>: It's in the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1946.408s">[Callahan]</a>: I missed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1947.128s">[Callahan]</a>: And the third thing is, I'm curious why I would love to avoid having these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1954.451s">[Callahan]</a>: unless there's a reason having the wording of the newsletters go to the full city council meeting, it seems like really this should just be in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1963.094s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't understand why we would want to send it to the full city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1988.132s">[Callahan]</a>: I just can't imagine having the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1990.6s">[Callahan]</a>: a 200, 300 word document be edited in a city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1994.463s">[Callahan]</a>: I literally think that's the wrong place for like that is that is not the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1998.787s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, this is a just a communication from the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2006.534s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not seconding that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2059.379s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't want us to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2064.532s">[Callahan]</a>: So anywhere you can just put this so that we don't forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2069.717s">[Callahan]</a>: Just put it in that document and then we'll look at it next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2072.419s">[Callahan]</a>: Like that we should really have a way for people to forward this to others so they can get on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2078.805s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the idea of putting upcoming, like even just a link to the upcoming meetings would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2086.351s">[Callahan]</a>: Those two things I think we should include in every newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2088.233s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2119.362s">[Callahan]</a>: The other one is a way for people if they forward it for people to get on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2137.557s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe you guys can work together to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2139.418s">[Callahan]</a>: And even if it doesn't end up in this newsletter, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2141.64s">[Callahan]</a>: But in the future, I think we should keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2157.532s">[Callahan]</a>: But isn't there a link that has all of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2163.696s">[Callahan]</a>: There's a link where you can see the upcoming meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2208.254s">[Callahan]</a>: The question is, how can people opt in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2431.227s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2431.828s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe this can be quick and exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2435.469s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not sure which of these should actually be motions and which should just be that we plan to keep this paper in committee and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2445.773s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think we should, I would like to make a motion that we form a subcommittee that includes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2455.16s">[Callahan]</a>: me, Councilor Tseng, and Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2458.923s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2462.345s">[Callahan]</a>: That's my emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2464.927s">[Callahan]</a>: About the listening sessions to ensure that these listening sessions happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2469.324s">[Callahan]</a>: And then, besides that motion, I want to open up two ideas for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2475.008s">[Callahan]</a>: One, that we try and hold approximately one per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2478.131s">[Callahan]</a>: So we try and hold maybe nine, you know, eight or nine this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2482.714s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I would love to have a quick brainstorming session about which groups to reach out to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2492.125s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that all part of your motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2493.045s">[Callahan]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2493.485s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2494.266s">[Callahan]</a>: The motion was only about a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2499.288s">[Callahan]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2499.868s">[Callahan]</a>: That's the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2500.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Everything else is just for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2502.129s">[Callahan]</a>: So that we do, you know, one a month, seven or eight this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2505.57s">[Callahan]</a>: And then Councilor Tseng and I already came up with a short list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2510.031s">[Callahan]</a>: So we can very quickly, I think, you know, brainstorm a list of groups to reach out to this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2515.473s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2551.802s">[Callahan]</a>: That is a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2552.664s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we'll meet as a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2555.007s">[Callahan]</a>: We'll have to, you know, discuss exactly the logistics of how that's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2560.014s">[Callahan]</a>: But we certainly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2563.206s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, we can make the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2565.267s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we can make a subcommittee open to as many people as our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2583.714s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2584.595s">[Callahan]</a>: And basically it will be a lot of it is just going to be doing the logistics of, you know, when to have these meetings set up and who's going to be there, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2607.692s">[Callahan]</a>: I will say that I think part of the idea is not to use conference rooms and buildings, but to really go to the place where these less represented folks feel comfortable, sort of go on their turf rather than our turf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2622.262s">[Callahan]</a>: So that'll be something that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2624.223s">[Callahan]</a>: May I open the discussion of some possible groups to reach out to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2649.475s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2650.315s">[Callahan]</a>: So first we thought there are five community liaisons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2653.103s">[Callahan]</a>: And those are, you know, five groups that we would love to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2657.767s">[Callahan]</a>: And then we also thought that high school students would be a really fantastic group and we could do potentially either have just have one group or we could have separate groups for the vocational school and the other half of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2675.101s">[Callahan]</a>: And then we thought the senior center would also be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2678.204s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2681.662s">[Callahan]</a>: reaching out maybe to some tough student groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2686.925s">[Callahan]</a>: And that right there is like, let's see, five for the community liaisons, one or two for the high schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2691.767s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, that's nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2692.728s">[Callahan]</a>: That's this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2693.908s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2702.733s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know the names of the liaisons themselves, but the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2709.734s">[Callahan]</a>: The groups that they represent are the Haitian community, the Arab community, the Portuguese-speaking community, Spanish-speaking, and I believe the fifth one is black residents in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2725.849s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that's accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2744.234s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is something that we should discuss in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2746.957s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there's going to be a little bit of trying to figure out exactly how that's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2754.444s">[Callahan]</a>: And we'll do a little bit of brainstorming to sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2757.23s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, understand the possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2758.571s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's just a longer discussion that we probably want to have to make this already pretty late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2770.059s">[Callahan]</a>: If there are other groups that folks want to reach out to, uh, you know, now is great or don't hesitate to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2781.892s">[Callahan]</a>: There's zillions of groups we could reach out to, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2784.613s">[Callahan]</a>: We don't want anybody to feel excluded, but we thought this would be a good starter set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2793.736s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2794.357s">[Callahan]</a>: I meant to include veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2796.657s">[Callahan]</a>: Veterans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2797.338s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2809.022s">[Callahan]</a>: Move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=8.0s">[Callahan]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=339.554s">[Callahan]</a>: I would love to hear more about the last one, state aid, chair sheets, and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=892.81s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=893.991s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there somewhere that we can look up what new growth has been in previous years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2683.043s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Gallagher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2685.624s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, that $250,000 is included in your new growth figure from before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2692.368s">[Callahan]</a>: This $250,000 is included in the new growth figure from the previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4069.342s">[Callahan]</a>: So just a quick question, if you happen to have these numbers off the top of your head, if not, I can look it up later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4074.085s">[Callahan]</a>: On this fiscal year 2025 budget impacts with these four sort of unavoidable cost increases, do you happen to know for each of those what sort of percentage of our budget those are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4085.171s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, what is the health insurance, you know, what about what percent of our budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4092.544s">[Callahan]</a>: If not, that's fine, I'll finally look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5656.343s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you just let me know a little bit more about what those, these two, 5240 and 5310 are, what those cover?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5662.989s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, maintenance and professional technical services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2360.029s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2360.99s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll use this opportunity to thank everyone for coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2364.252s">[Callahan]</a>: Just save a little bit of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2365.833s">[Callahan]</a>: So appreciate your work that you do every day as well as the time that you're taking in an evening to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2371.636s">[Callahan]</a>: My specific question for you is how much funding comes from the cable companies and sort of what percentage of your budget is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2378.56s">[Callahan]</a>: Just curious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4651.527s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4656.701s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4657.681s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4658.622s">[Callahan]</a>: Very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4659.282s">[Callahan]</a>: And thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4661.643s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4663.824s">[Callahan]</a>: And pardon me for my sort of not having a lot of history with the veteran services and asking some very basic questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4671.147s">[Callahan]</a>: But do you have a sense for just the number of veterans that we have in Medford is one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4676.509s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe if there's any sort of age breakdown, like how many of them are really older and are also able to use the senior center and the Council on Aging services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4686.933s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's two questions I'm happy to, I don't even, I'll tell them all to you and then I can remind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4692.936s">[Callahan]</a>: And the third question, and this is my nubiest question, which is, in addition to payroll, I actually would love to just get some vague sense of what the other funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4702.681s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4704.241s">[Callahan]</a>: So as of, ooh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5298.772s">[Callahan]</a>: Move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5311.779s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5313.2s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1802.947s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1803.447s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, these letters were a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1808.103s">[Callahan]</a>: quite frightening reminder that our water pipes are 100 years old, almost older than any other city, and that instead of over the decades spending the money that came in through our water system on the water system and replacing these pipes for decades, that that money went into the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1831.937s">[Callahan]</a>: and was spent on other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1833.518s">[Callahan]</a>: And so we have, for decades, not improved our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1838.16s">[Callahan]</a>: We have, for decades, not improved our roads, which is why that 49% of our roads as of 2021, hard to know whether that's improved or gotten worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1851.014s">[Callahan]</a>: probably has gotten worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1853.135s">[Callahan]</a>: 49% of our roads are in the worst two classes of roads out of five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1857.098s">[Callahan]</a>: That's the most expensive kinds to replace, to repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1861.682s">[Callahan]</a>: Our schools, which are 20 years old, have not been properly maintained for the last 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1867.787s">[Callahan]</a>: Salaries, and we talk about the salary of this particular position in the water department, but salaries across the city are not commensurate with other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1880.168s">[Callahan]</a>: So we can't find people to fill a lot of positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1882.87s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not just that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1883.931s">[Callahan]</a>: There are a lot of positions we cannot find people to fill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1888.854s">[Callahan]</a>: Previous administrations have been like 30, 40 years ago were given a city in pretty good shape and did not do the repairs that were needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1901.104s">[Callahan]</a>: And that has left us in a position that I'm really, they've kicked the can down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1905.886s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm trying to understand what kind of management style it would make up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1910.188s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, if $500 million is the amount to repair our water system, and we know that it's $100 million probably or more to repair the roads, get the roads back into shape, there isn't a style of management that can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1925.339s">[Callahan]</a>: magically make that money up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1928.8s">[Callahan]</a>: My thing about the management is not that I'm making any kind of statement, but my statement is about the funding that we have to do the absolute basics necessary for a city to function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1942.622s">[Callahan]</a>: You cannot have water pipes that function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1946.143s">[Callahan]</a>: You do not have a city, functional city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1948.083s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't have roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1949.524s">[Callahan]</a>: These are the basics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1951.164s">[Callahan]</a>: And this isn't purely the fault of this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1954.687s">[Callahan]</a>: This is something that we have kicked the can down the road for many decades until we find ourselves by doing things that were financially irresponsible, but were made taxpayers happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1969.817s">[Callahan]</a>: And now we're in a position where we have had that situation going on for so long that we're going straight off a cliff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1986.826s">[Callahan]</a>: I talked to some of the engineering folks about the water systems, and they said, oh, you know, there is money coming into the water system that we can use to repair it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1996.553s">[Callahan]</a>: But of course, that money used to go to other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1999.655s">[Callahan]</a>: That money has always come in, and it used to go to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2003.077s">[Callahan]</a>: So now that money isn't going to be going to the things that it used to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2007.14s">[Callahan]</a>: So those things will go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2009.081s">[Callahan]</a>: There is not enough funding to take care of the financial irresponsibility of former administrations and former city councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2017.827s">[Callahan]</a>: really administrations because the state councils do not have do not have hardly any effect on the budget because it's really up in the hands of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4933.997s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4935.678s">[Callahan]</a>: Um I definitely do believe that, uh, our city's underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4939.819s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it is a pretty simple math problem that when you don't fix your water price for 100 years, you don't fix your roads for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4945.021s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't fix your schools for 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4946.581s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4950.578s">[Callahan]</a>: for years so that those salaries are below commensurate for other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4955.303s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that that math problem is pretty simple one, but that doesn't mean that I believe that all of our money is being spent properly and I really appreciate this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4964.672s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's incredibly important that we understand and that the community also understands how money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4971.777s">[Callahan]</a>: and that we are really responsible and that that money is not being wasted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4977.42s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really appreciate this resolution and any other resolutions that come to us having transparency and understanding the way that the city is being run and to make sure that our funds are being used well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8422.059s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8423.399s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm sad that we cannot have any impact over that, and it's too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8428.761s">[Callahan]</a>: And so all I'm saying is to you guys, but also to anyone else, don't hesitate to come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8436.163s">[Callahan]</a>: If we can put pressure and make the difference between that FEMA grant being in a better position to pass, then reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8444.806s">[Callahan]</a>: And secondly, I really wanted to talk a little bit about this question of mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8450.267s">[Callahan]</a>: because I think it is raised all the time, the question of wasting money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8457.231s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm curious about it, and I want to learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8460.472s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to ensure that we know in terms of transparency and that the community knows how money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8466.636s">[Callahan]</a>: But I do also think there's another question that we haven't been talking about as much about recently, which is being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8477.421s">[Callahan]</a>: the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8478.541s">[Callahan]</a>: We have run departments where sorry, um, support being supportive of unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8483.522s">[Callahan]</a>: We have many unions in the city that do not get contracts for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8488.544s">[Callahan]</a>: Um my opinion of what has been happening this year with the fire department is that it really has demoralized<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8503.127s">[Callahan]</a>: a fan of what has been going on between the mayor and the fire department, as I said at one of the previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8509.909s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am interested in understanding, I really question how you guys can have a consulting firm where you're already looking into this, the mayor is doing separate consulting firm and the wisdom of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8526.293s">[Callahan]</a>: And from a union perspective, that it seems like you're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8532.834s">[Callahan]</a>: many combined years of experience is not being looked to at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8538.679s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I have to say that I do really question the wisdom of this, and that I want to be supportive of the fire union, and I will leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9028.045s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9029.746s">[Callahan]</a>: It seems that no one really is in charge of making sure that this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9034.775s">[Callahan]</a>: No one at the trust is in charge, no one at DPW is in charge, and this sort of has just gone on because nobody's been focusing on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9040.438s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there any way to get somebody to, it's their responsibility to focus on it, or is that, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=671.917s">[Callahan]</a>: Is this the right moment for questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=822.153s">[Callahan]</a>: I did just have a question about the site plan review topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=825.395s">[Callahan]</a>: This is just my lack of knowledge about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=827.515s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there a super brief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=829.896s">[Callahan]</a>: What is that covering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=882.38s">[Callahan]</a>: If I may, we could take one step back and say like site plan review, like what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2221.249s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2222.65s">[Callahan]</a>: I mentioned this last time, and I'm just curious who would be the right person to talk to about potentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2230.049s">[Callahan]</a>: what it might mean to add a coworking as a zoning use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2238.954s">[Callahan]</a>: With the concept that instead of office, like office building is sort of the place that it might fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2243.917s">[Callahan]</a>: And we might not want giant office buildings like scattered across Medford, but to allow like small coworking places that are designed as neighborhood connection spots and places where people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2257.383s">[Callahan]</a>: have one desk and meet their neighbors and go during the day now that we're sort of in a world of remote work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2265.729s">[Callahan]</a>: It is not something I've thought through super deeply, but I'm curious, aside from one or two Councilors, if there are staff people or whoever that I can talk to that know more about zoning that might have some ability to speak to whether it would be useful or whether there is no need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2707.17s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2707.83s">[Callahan]</a>: Just looking through theme five, the climate resilience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2710.711s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted some of these seem like they kind of lean towards this but I wanted to ask if there is currently or if there are plans to have sort of percentage of lots that can be covered by impermeable surfaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2731.754s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I would imagine that is where it would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2738.762s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2739.223s">[Callahan]</a>: Just wondering if there is anything currently in the zoning or if their plans to put in the zoning any sort of limits on the percentage of a lot of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2748.103s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, amount of a lot in some way that is covered by impermeables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1530.199s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1532.02s">[Callahan]</a>: So one thing that I feel pretty strongly about is that the folks who live in Medford and rent out properties in Medford, these are always the best landlords we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1545.311s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that the city is currently making an effort to reach out to landlords to make sure that they know about the different rebate programs that there are at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1556.319s">[Callahan]</a>: And tax incentives in order to retrofit their houses, but it's very difficult to reach that group of people because we just don't know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1564.306s">[Callahan]</a>: There are also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1566.667s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, we have on our docket for things that we are hope to do, and I know I'm excited to do is to implement what the state has now allowed, which is a good landlord tax credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1578.234s">[Callahan]</a>: That would also, you know, you have to apply to that, and that would be much easier for us to reach those good landlords in town if we knew who they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1587.719s">[Callahan]</a>: And there are all sorts of other reasons down the line that it could be really helpful for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1591.541s">[Callahan]</a>: I know in the climate adaptation and action plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1595.844s">[Callahan]</a>: it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1597.645s">[Callahan]</a>: There are ways that, you know, reaching out to landlords, knowing who landlords are in terms of retrofitting buildings is going to be really helpful in terms of, you know, being able to provide rental protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1611.216s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that we many people as I campaigned were upset with absentee landlords who allow their buildings to fall into disrepair or allow to have there to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1622.765s">[Callahan]</a>: know, junk in the, in their yards, and being able to know who landlords are what properties are landlords and reach the tenants in those buildings as well to communicate them we we have tenants rights ordinance which we passed recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1641.162s">[Callahan]</a>: being able to know who which properties those are so we can reach those people would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1647.206s">[Callahan]</a>: And really all we're talking about is simple, simple registry that would just have the listing of which properties and how many you know which units are rental properties, and who is a contact person that we can reach out to in terms of the property management or the landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1664.037s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's what this is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1665.638s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1789.77s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1791.271s">[Callahan]</a>: I would just reply that I have spoken to the planning department and they say that they're actually kind of excited to have this because a lot of the things that they're trying to do are very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1802.477s">[Callahan]</a>: For example, that they have on their docket to reach out to landlords specifically about rebate programs at the state level, and that's very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1813.064s">[Callahan]</a>: They just don't have access to who those people are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1815.995s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that from the planning side, they are kind of excited to be able to have this information, and they see it as being beneficial to them rather than a burden to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1994.664s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1995.705s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, my direct response is all we're doing is giving this a number and we're beginning the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2001.626s">[Callahan]</a>: So the truth is, we're going to be taking input from the planning department, from the building commissioner, from the administrative staff to understand how is this best implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2011.768s">[Callahan]</a>: So really, this is all we're doing is starting the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2015.309s">[Callahan]</a>: But as far as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2018.888s">[Callahan]</a>: who will implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2020.19s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that the administration already, because this was in the plan that would come up a few years ago, I think they already have ideas and I would look to the administration for information like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2111.423s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, this is the beginning of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2127.515s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is the beginning of a many months long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2135.158s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, this is the beginning of a many months long process at which the public is welcome to attend any of those meetings that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2146.181s">[Callahan]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2149.238s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding is that at a minimum, it is the address of the property, the address of which unit is a rental property, and information on how to contact the landlord or property management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4737.417s">[Callahan]</a>: My name is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4739.76s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan just to a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4741.402s">[Callahan]</a>: Renters are not on the registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=4744.205s">[Callahan]</a>: There's rental properties that are on the right, so just be property owners and renters themselves are not on registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8214.857s">[Callahan]</a>: I hear everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8219.021s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think what I'm struggling with is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8224.702s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding of how we work on policies is we bring a suggestion for something that we might pass in a year or two years or six months or whatever, we bring it here to get it a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8240.436s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, any policy, whatever policy that is, it is by definition, it is not totally worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8250.043s">[Callahan]</a>: Not all of the answers are there, because this is how we create policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8255.264s">[Callahan]</a>: We create policy by giving it a number, and then by sending it through a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8259.466s">[Callahan]</a>: And that process, and tell me if I'm wrong, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8263.547s">[Callahan]</a>: That process involves three public hearings, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8267.908s">[Callahan]</a>: It has to go through first reading, second reading, third, something like that, after it's been written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8274.854s">[Callahan]</a>: After all of the committee meetings, it involves three times that it has to appear before the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8280.677s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's when the answer, when all of the questions, when it's been worked through with the staff, with, you know, in committee with the public, with, you know, whatever sort of listening sessions and other things that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8295.104s">[Callahan]</a>: So what I'm struggling with is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8298.206s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, we're bringing things here to give it a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8303.188s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that does is it allows us to then begin the process of discussing it publicly where everyone is welcome for many months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8312.993s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think for the, like the leaf blower ordinance, we had eight or nine, was it nine public meetings about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8324.844s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought that we had the eighth leaf blower like public swap but we had a lot of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8330.608s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I think what I'm trying to say is, this is the second time since I've been a city council which is like three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8340.97s">[Callahan]</a>: people come, dozens of people come to the meeting to prevent us from ever being able to discuss a policy and we're being accused of not knowing all of the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8354.381s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, the reason that we have this process is so that we can include the public in the entire discussion of every aspect of it and every detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8365.109s">[Callahan]</a>: So what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8370.06s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will say, I'm saddened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8372.941s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm very saddened that I now seem to be on the receiving end of something where, specifically for in-town landlords, I have for years talked about how in-town landlords are the people that we want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8393.071s">[Callahan]</a>: And there's video of me from years ago<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8397.89s">[Callahan]</a>: So, like, this is, I just want to know we're coming up on the 15 minute limit for the previous question today, you have about a minute, then I want to go a minute but that's what I'm struggling with is I want to begin the conversation, so that we can talk about it for many months in open public committee meetings, and then we can have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8416.795s">[Callahan]</a>: the three public hearings in the city council, all of which are designed to answer those detailed questions and for you to have input on those answers, those questions and answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8426.781s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's what I'm struggling to get to is the point where we can actually discuss this rather than having it shut down before anyone is allowed to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.349s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8589.829s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8590.21s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9898.045s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, so I was, I'm not actually in favor of reducing the amount of time that people, so I would have done this differently, let's put it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9908.392s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think that having, and I've looked at some other cities, I have to say, I am so happy that we do something that I have not seen really anywhere else, I guess maybe Revere does it, but that we let people speak on every single agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9922.765s">[Callahan]</a>: Most cities, there's one public comment period that applies to like anything that's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9929.748s">[Callahan]</a>: You have your two minutes during that public comment period and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9933.829s">[Callahan]</a>: And you don't get to be there when they're debating the whole rest of, while they're debating the body is debating that particular agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9940.812s">[Callahan]</a>: So I love that we do that and I think that we should keep that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9943.673s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm glad this doesn't in any way get rid of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9947.515s">[Callahan]</a>: I do think that meetings that go to one, two, three o'clock in the morning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9951.94s">[Callahan]</a>: the poor people who have to speak on a topic that doesn't come up until after midnight, like that's also, that's just not good democracy, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9963.73s">[Callahan]</a>: The way I would have done it, and I don't know how much people are open to changes on the floor, but I think that we should have a limit on the end time of the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9978.522s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we limit the end time of the meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9982.037s">[Callahan]</a>: So that nobody has to stay up until you know one o'clock in the morning to be heard on their on their agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9989.713s">[Callahan]</a>: Then, allowing the chair, which I think we already have as an option to before any public participation to declare hey like there's 100 people in the room for this item, we're going to leave it to and we and this is currently our policy anyway that we have done for this item, we're going to have two minutes per issue we did that you know a number of weeks ago for a different issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10014.153s">[Callahan]</a>: And that the chair can do that in order to meet the deadline of the midnight 1231 o'clock whatever it is that we decide is the final hour that this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10023.782s">[Callahan]</a>: that the city council meetings end on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10026.064s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's where I would go with it is have like a meeting end time so that nobody has to stay up till one o'clock in the morning just to speak on their issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10035.189s">[Callahan]</a>: The other possibility is to let public comment happen at the beginning and then have it apply to all of the agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10041.172s">[Callahan]</a>: That's very common.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10042.853s">[Callahan]</a>: And then nobody, no members of the public have to stay until midnight, one o'clock in the morning in order to speak on their agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10052.261s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think there are other ways to go that would let people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10061.471s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just not sure that this is the one that I, I'm not sure that I love this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10618.561s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to be slightly more clear than what I said before, which is I would actually really like to discuss this, to be able to come up with some other ideas in committee rather than voting on this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10632.216s">[Callahan]</a>: So that'd be my preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.464s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12840.825s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to address one thing, because I'm feeling frustrated that I brought the rental registry here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12851.932s">[Callahan]</a>: And I very purposefully did not decide a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12855.453s">[Callahan]</a>: I did not want to have come up with all the answers because I wanted to be part of the public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12860.974s">[Callahan]</a>: So this you have already decided everything, that's why I couldn't answer questions about the details of rental registry because I don't want to come here having decided everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12870.695s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12872.015s">[Callahan]</a>: We get a number for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12874.116s">[Callahan]</a>: And it's frustrating that dozens of people are coming out to say, don't give it a number so that it can be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12881.912s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what I'm having trouble with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12883.476s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to be able to give something a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12885.0s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think we should not have all the details before we give it a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12888.549s">[Callahan]</a>: But then I'm being...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12890.222s">[Callahan]</a>: criticized that I don't have all the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12894.223s">[Callahan]</a>: But the reason I don't have all the answers is because I don't want to have come here having decided everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12899.444s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to give it a number so that we can have a public process of many public meetings so that your opinions, the public opinions, can exactly be part of this process that you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12911.988s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's part of what I want to be able to do here is have fewer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12919.135s">[Callahan]</a>: long extended discussions, and I'm not talking about this particular resolution, but fewer long extended discussions that prevent us, people saying, please do not begin a discussion about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12931.543s">[Callahan]</a>: I would much rather people come to the discussion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12934.465s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, let's agree to have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12936.467s">[Callahan]</a>: And then we can have the discussion where people can give their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12939.569s">[Callahan]</a>: But to come here with dozens and dozens of people saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12943.171s">[Callahan]</a>: Whatever you do, you're a terrible person, if you agree to allow this to be discussed, I find it... This is why you might see me not, quote-unquote, listening to dozens of people, because all I'm voting for is for it to be allowed to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12962.203s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think it should be discussed and that's for, you know, these other things, whether it's the real estate transfer fee, the rental registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12971.087s">[Callahan]</a>: All I'm saying is, we should be able to discuss it in open public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12976.59s">[Callahan]</a>: This is part of what I'm a little bit frustrated with is the idea that we're coming here having already decided and then suddenly it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12983.193s">[Callahan]</a>: to zero or six to one or five to two because we've already decided, but like all I wanted to do is discuss and be able to like have the open public forum that you are asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12995.997s">[Callahan]</a>: So I guess that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12997.737s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15705.797s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I just don't exactly understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15708.999s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that there's a B paper attached to this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15735.244s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you restate that B paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15762.423s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15890.106s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just that when there is a question of whether we're going to send something to committee to be able to open a many months long discussion, I'm going to vote yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15901.135s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we need to be able to have those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15903.917s">[Callahan]</a>: This is actually something that we're gonna be changing these rules today, and that will be a permanent change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15910.363s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15911.524s">[Callahan]</a>: I didn't feel comfortable when I read it, and my position has not changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15917.31s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not gonna be voting this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21920.964s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21921.944s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep, I think it says it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21924.005s">[Callahan]</a>: We are really just sending this into committee to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21927.186s">[Callahan]</a>: Hopefully it will be a way for us to reach out to people who rarely or never come to these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21934.329s">[Callahan]</a>: Those 70% of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21936.15s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, the 50% of people who never vote in city elections, 70% who didn't vote in this particular city election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21941.332s">[Callahan]</a>: 70% who didn't vote for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21946.694s">[Callahan]</a>: Those folks who are not engaged politically, we want to be able to hear what their lives are like, and that's what this is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=403.925s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=404.485s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious if that monthly report comes in, who goes over the report and then what happens after that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1268.173s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we think that it's appropriate given that a lot of this is for new construction, and some of it may be fossil fuel stuff construction in buildings, is this a place where we can request that the departments that we're talking to take into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1286.434s">[Callahan]</a>: incentives for our climate goals or our affordable housing goals that are lined out in our various plans, like the CAP, the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, or our Affordable Housing Production Plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1302.398s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we ask that they take those into consideration when they are updating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1799.938s">[Callahan]</a>: As I'm scrolling through all these many fees, I do notice taxi cabs on here, and I'm curious if the city has done anything about including the gig worker cab things into, I assume that this only applies to actual taxi cabs and not to like Uber drivers and everything else,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1818.083s">[Callahan]</a>: So I don't know whether, I mean, that seems to me clearly to be totally outdated, and maybe we need something totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1899.614s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have a way of knowing which of these fees bring in what amount of money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1905.377s">[Callahan]</a>: Or which categories of fees bring in what amount of money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2575.5s">[Callahan]</a>: Move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2578.381s">[Callahan]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=931.206s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=931.646s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm curious if we know how other cities are currently doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=939.752s">[Callahan]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=940.133s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=940.853s">[Callahan]</a>: That's something we might want to look into is see some of our surrounding cities, how they deal with food trucks, and if they all have to go to the city council, if they just have it done by, you know, the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2086.907s">[Callahan]</a>: I just had a question because it sounds like what the attorney is saying is that according to our laws, we only have the ability to give permission for these food trucks on public ways and all the other entities like the parks and the schools do their own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2112.372s">[Callahan]</a>: food truck licensing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2114.173s">[Callahan]</a>: What it sounds like Councilor Scarpelli is saying is that this is not the practice that we have done, and it is also perhaps not what our former city solicitor said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2123.9s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, that makes things a little muddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2129.484s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would love to have, I mean, maybe that's just the reality, but if there can be any clarification on that, I think it would help us understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=927.982s">[Callahan]</a>: If that proposal goes through, then it probably makes my point sort of moot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=932.324s">[Callahan]</a>: But I was sort of looking as a relatively new Councilor to understand, obviously the Metro Public Schools is the largest department in terms of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=942.509s">[Callahan]</a>: But there's dozens of departments listed here on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=946.231s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm looking for a chart that shows me the size of the budget for each one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=950.593s">[Callahan]</a>: So we have an understanding of like, okay, are 20 of these so tiny that they're not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=956.414s">[Callahan]</a>: worried, concerned about them, but I will do some research there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=960.039s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that rephrasing to make it any grant funded position is probably a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1500.0s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, it was just a quick, did this not already go into committee as a request that we were making in the committee, in Public Works Committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1508.006s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought it maybe did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1509.487s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanna make sure we're not doubling up two motions for the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1513.891s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm totally in favor, and also the five-year plan for the roads, I think, is going to go through that committee as well, rather than be a budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1522.403s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. Clark, do you happen to remember if a motion went through the committee, the Public Works Committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1528.251s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm looking it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1535.987s">[Callahan]</a>: either way we should have to look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1843.672s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1849.813s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2640.947s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2642.208s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to ask you about civil service law and whether we are currently following civil service law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2648.172s">[Callahan]</a>: So the appointment of the active chief, was that done appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2651.734s">[Callahan]</a>: Was was the are we gearing up for the required testing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2657.158s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you know if we're currently like on schedule to follow through with civil service law as we are supposed to right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4454.926s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4456.127s">[Callahan]</a>: I appreciate all the work that has been done on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4458.85s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to comment a little bit about what I saw when I was campaigning and what I have also seen here in these chambers and heard people speak about, which is that when people do not trust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4471.522s">[Callahan]</a>: the way, when they don't understand how their money is being spent, and they don't trust the way that that money is being used, then they never want to give the city another penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4482.628s">[Callahan]</a>: So when you combine lack of transparency with underfunding, which I believe is what has happened to Medford over many, many years, what happens is you have a breakdown of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4493.034s">[Callahan]</a>: So to me, making sure that the public<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4496.776s">[Callahan]</a>: through this budget ordinance has access to seeing and understanding how are the money that comes into the city is spent, and to know that that money is being spent on things that they are in fact seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4510.082s">[Callahan]</a>: I think this is going to help not only<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4512.603s">[Callahan]</a>: the way that we move the budget forward, but it's also gonna help get people to understand that, yes, the city is or is not, you know, whatever we find, right, when we've got this transparency, using the funds wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4527.789s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think we will also see that there's genuine underfunding of most city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6220.118s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to ask if you have run this by the Community Development Board as well as the Office of Planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6799.192s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6799.992s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to mention that I do have a friend who lives in one of these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6805.916s">[Callahan]</a>: cooperatively owned buildings in Boston, and he raves about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6810.938s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'd be excited to talk about that as an affordable housing possibility as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=376.092s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I do have a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=377.474s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to make sure we're talking about an email newsletter specifically, or do you mean more broadly the sense of a newsletter that could be email and other things as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=399.965s">[Callahan]</a>: I just didn't know whether when you said the word newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=402.287s">[Callahan]</a>: No, that's a great clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=403.729s">[Callahan]</a>: That you meant the email part of it, or if you were talking more broadly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=442.128s">[Callahan]</a>: on the second, but also a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=447.092s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=447.893s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so I I'm assuming that this, um, sort of voluntary sign up will be available to all because and not just those are this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=634.964s">[Callahan]</a>: This is how we do it, if it comes to me for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=637.565s">[Callahan]</a>: No, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=640.766s">[Callahan]</a>: So it seems to me that in addition to an email, like having our own email list, specifically because of the laws around opt-in, that any list really should, if you want to have an email list, then you'll have to be opt-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=658.909s">[Callahan]</a>: If we want for people to be able to get access to this information, they should be able to opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=664.611s">[Callahan]</a>: They should also be able to follow a social media account on their preferred social media platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=668.872s">[Callahan]</a>: So I want you to reread that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=674.094s">[Callahan]</a>: But to me, that sounds a little vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=676.995s">[Callahan]</a>: The language, I wasn't sure exactly what you meant by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=679.196s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wonder if we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=681.954s">[Callahan]</a>: very specifically have something that's more talking about the creation of, um, followable distribution platforms, which would include things like an email list that people can opt into, um, a, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=699.124s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, an X account, a YouTube account, you know, blah, blah, blah, like accounts on those specific platforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=719.158s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, what's the third motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=762.33s">[Callahan]</a>: When you say that, it might take a while to set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1210.676s">[Callahan]</a>: Just I was going to answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1524.189s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1525.15s">[Callahan]</a>: I agree with both of y'all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1526.35s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just wanted to add that I'm probably even more excited to put into the newsletter things that are upcoming than things that already passed, because that allows for people in the community to participate in the decisions to be involved in engaging in democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1543.801s">[Callahan]</a>: So those are difficult to spin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1546.382s">[Callahan]</a>: We simply just state what is coming up and what is going to be on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1550.225s">[Callahan]</a>: And that way, people will know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1552.626s">[Callahan]</a>: when to come if they want to speak out about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1554.307s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1734.27s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1734.81s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1737.452s">[Callahan]</a>: I assume this is because I only had four hours of sleep, although it could also be because you only had four hours of sleep when you wrote these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1743.796s">[Callahan]</a>: But I didn't fully understand the first three motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1749.079s">[Callahan]</a>: And if it's okay with you, because, hey, we're in a body where words matter, do you mind reading those slowly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1755.583s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think I will probably make slight amendments just to the wording to make sure that that wording is easily understood by everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1761.506s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1762.106s">[Callahan]</a>: One at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1803.181s">[Callahan]</a>: The only thing for me is the word newsletter to me, it means email newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1807.105s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wonder if we can call it a communications plan or communications or I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1814.092s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't know if there's a better word and if everybody else thinks it's fine, that's fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1818.696s">[Callahan]</a>: But like I was confused when I really thought you meant an email newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1852.955s">[Callahan]</a>: That just, that just feels like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1857.83s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's difficult because... If you guys understand it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1860.613s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, it meant something different from what you meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1894.914s">[Callahan]</a>: What if we say monthly newsletter content?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1928.328s">[Callahan]</a>: and when we will have perhaps left a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1941.257s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I didn't realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1978.091s">[Callahan]</a>: As long as it specifically includes any city councilor, not just this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1982.014s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, I'll make sure that yeah, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1984.696s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1985.116s">[Callahan]</a>: Love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2036.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2037.294s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2037.935s">[Callahan]</a>: Beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2038.876s">[Callahan]</a>: And so it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2061.081s">[Callahan]</a>: Love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2062.622s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2067.525s">[Callahan]</a>: That does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2095.464s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I was just going to say like, you know, if the mayor helps distribute or any of these other email lists agrees, then what they do is they don't just distribute our content as if it's theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2104.547s">[Callahan]</a>: They say, you know, sign up here, like here's the content sign up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2109.589s">[Callahan]</a>: And that gives everyone on their list the opportunity to opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2683.106s">[Callahan]</a>: really make an effort to be on all of those platforms, because that's kind of the point, is that each platform has its own subset of people that actually check that platform and prefer that platform to other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2693.974s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we should not neglect to at least consider texting, WhatsApp, discourse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2705.924s">[Callahan]</a>: These are things, so especially like texting and WhatsApp are used by a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2711.405s">[Callahan]</a>: less affluent immigrant communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2714.788s">[Callahan]</a>: And so if we don't even discuss them, and I understand that texting probably would cost us money, but if we don't at least consider those, I think that we are sort of blocking off certain people to engagement and specifically people who tend to be the least engaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2733.04s">[Callahan]</a>: So I would love for us to consider those as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3220.417s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize, I will have to leave in nine minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3224.159s">[Callahan]</a>: I move that we join these and approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3407.844s">[Callahan]</a>: I can be that person creating a paper to report and putting on the agenda at some point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3412.208s">[Callahan]</a>: All right, yeah, I better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3426.221s">[Callahan]</a>: Move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=890.469s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=891.609s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, super excited to be working on this and to have a team of people dedicated to all the research and legal and urban planning work that needs to be done to do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=903.874s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited to hear where specific policies that we have all proposed might fit into here, into the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=911.637s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to encourage if it's possible and if this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=917.499s">[Callahan]</a>: that fits into your presentation, feel free to drop in mentioning policies as examples of things that could go in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=927.765s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it might also help folks who are in the audience, both on Zoom and here in person, to understand what kinds of things we mean with these more generic buckets that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=937.611s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1665.765s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just gonna throw in one thing that I've heard from some constituents, and I think we should also think carefully about because it does seem like a post pandemic request, but folks who have been working from home would, folks that I've heard from would really appreciate having a mini office space that they could go to that's very close to their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1688.042s">[Callahan]</a>: And I don't know if that's another thing we could think about as a possible zoning is having these micro pockets of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1696.143s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, tiny office space, like, you know, one of these spaces where you just rent a desk, tiny micro office space, coffee shop, lunch place, something like that, which would allow people to sort of start getting out of their homes who currently don't have to go to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1717.137s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2867.752s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2870.855s">[Callahan]</a>: It would be really helpful to be able to see the list of minor changes that have been requested from staff and from the Zoning Board, and what is our best way of doing that within open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2882.424s">[Callahan]</a>: Can we request that they send those to us in advance of a meeting and then make those public, or are they ready to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2889.27s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that something you feel like we're at a space where that would be useful for the City Council to see that list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3385.785s">[Callahan]</a>: do you think we can do both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3390.066s">[Callahan]</a>: Just timing wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3390.806s">[Callahan]</a>: I think economic development and climate put them both on the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3394.447s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess we can always, if we don't get them covered, we can always put them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3593.821s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=803.974s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=806.826s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=808.386s">[Callahan]</a>: On the idea of like having a lost cat or other pet and trying to lure them back, I do think that that is already accounted for in section B, number D, number, sorry, section D, number B, that there's an exemption for feeding of pets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=826.69s">[Callahan]</a>: And only if the food intended for pets is determined to be the source of wildlife feeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=830.891s">[Callahan]</a>: So it seems like it's okay to do that already according to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=835.893s">[Callahan]</a>: but only if it is determined to be the source of wildlife feeding, would then there be some sort of a, you know, they would be required to take some steps to render that food inaccessible to wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=847.782s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that probably already falls under the ordinance as my suspicion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2819.198s">[Callahan]</a>: As far as the question of getting proper budgetary information out of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2825.921s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that's an entirely separate discussion, I agree that that's a big problem, and we as a city council have been working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2833.764s">[Callahan]</a>: I even before I got on the city council to make sure that that's a more transparent process that the mayor is asked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2840.547s">[Callahan]</a>: and has been asked repeatedly and now has to follow a schedule to provide information this is something that this city council and the city council before me has worked very hard on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2849.494s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is not something that we are ignoring this is something we are working very hard to make sure happens, but it is a totally separate issue from whether<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2858.241s">[Callahan]</a>: we have 12 month availability of free cash, essentially, or if we only have free cash after it has been certified, which can take six to nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2867.527s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is what this question is, is a question of whether we have, as a city, have availability of that free cash for 12 months, or whether we have availability for that free cash only after it has been certified six to nine months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2882.878s">[Callahan]</a>: I completely agree with many of the people who spoke here that the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2888.562s">[Callahan]</a>: The roads are in terrible condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2891.144s">[Callahan]</a>: Our school buildings are in terrible condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2893.606s">[Callahan]</a>: Our school budget is not anywhere near large enough for the amount of teachers that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2900.852s">[Callahan]</a>: I completely agree with those sentiments and that reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2906.156s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that it's because of decades of underfunding of this city, because that is why the roads have come to the point where they have come, and why the school buildings have come to the point where they have come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2916.345s">[Callahan]</a>: That is also a separate issue from the question of whether we have year round access to essentially free cash, or whether we can cannot access that free cash for the first six to nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2929.211s">[Callahan]</a>: So, to me, this really is a question simply of whether, and I appreciate cancer Scarpelli for your consideration for the newer city Councilors of which I am one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2942.401s">[Callahan]</a>: I would not mind a little bit more time to understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2945.662s">[Callahan]</a>: But I will say that it seems quite clear to me that, first of all, we're not taxing anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2955.926s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not increasing the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2958.227s">[Callahan]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2959.087s">[Callahan]</a>: This literally does not have to do anything with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2963.809s">[Callahan]</a>: It converts free cash from something that we cannot access to something that we can access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2969.111s">[Callahan]</a>: And that free cash is literally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2972.092s">[Callahan]</a>: what happens when the income that comes into the city and the budget that goes out of the city, the actual spent budget that goes out of the city differ, which they have to do, or else you don't have a bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2984.155s">[Callahan]</a>: So understanding the budget of the city and how it functions, I do believe that creating this fund is the smart thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2995.437s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm willing to vote on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4395.899s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4396.66s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, I know that on that lot right now, there are a lot of wonderful tall trees that block the busy Broadway street from those other streets that are a little bit further in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4411.05s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you talk a little bit about the proposed green space and whether there will continue to be trees there or be new trees planted, aside from the pocket park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4447.197s">[Callahan]</a>: They're quite lovely and tall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6688.517s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9719.486s">[Callahan]</a>: I am going to reiterate what has been already said a number of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9723.727s">[Callahan]</a>: All we are voting on tonight is whether we are allowed to discuss this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9729.509s">[Callahan]</a>: So anything that comes before us has to get a number and go to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9734.98s">[Callahan]</a>: That's how we start the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9737.064s">[Callahan]</a>: That's how we have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9738.847s">[Callahan]</a>: That's how we also continue to get public input as we craft any sort of legislation of any kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9746.754s">[Callahan]</a>: We literally don't have a single word written about what kind of transfer fee we would do because we can't until we get a number and we send it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9755.0s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is going to take months because we're going to take a lot of input from the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9759.603s">[Callahan]</a>: So as far as having a well-functioning democracy and being able to discuss important issues, this is how it starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9768.129s">[Callahan]</a>: We're only voting on whether we can discuss this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9771.07s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is what we're voting on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9773.771s">[Callahan]</a>: I also really want people to have a little bit of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9778.653s">[Callahan]</a>: I know way too much about state politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9782.035s">[Callahan]</a>: And I can tell you that of any communities that have passed a real estate transfer fee, as with many other housing related issues, the state does not approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9794.52s">[Callahan]</a>: So what is going to happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9797.677s">[Callahan]</a>: is if we are lucky enough to pass anything,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9802.557s">[Callahan]</a>: that is related to a real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9804.978s">[Callahan]</a>: It will not be approved by the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9808.399s">[Callahan]</a>: The only thing likely to come out through the state is what is gonna be very similar to Governor Healey's proposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9816.102s">[Callahan]</a>: Governor Healey's proposition, just so you know, is 1% on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9823.724s">[Callahan]</a>: Nothing will affect anyone who sells a house less than a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9829.068s">[Callahan]</a>: And the only tax is on what is over a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9832.33s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you sell your house for $1.1 million, the total tax for you is $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9837.312s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, I hope I can assuage some people's fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9842.835s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really hope that we can have a respectful discussion tonight and that you all can participate in our many months long discussion that we hopefully will be about to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9854.54s">[Callahan]</a>: that will happen in perfectly open committee meetings, which we invite you all to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9859.586s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15478.303s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks, just point of personal privilege and I appreciate the opportunity in case other folks, maybe I misspoke or people didn't understand what I said earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15486.525s">[Callahan]</a>: I was not saying that if we pass something like this, it will never get through the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15490.606s">[Callahan]</a>: What I was saying is that the likelihood that our version, that any version we pass is different from Governor Healey's version is very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15500.689s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that means is that it will be a 1% tax<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15504.25s">[Callahan]</a>: on buyer or seller, it will only affect homes over a million dollars and only the amount of money over a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15510.196s">[Callahan]</a>: That was the reason that I brought up how difficult it is to pass through the statehouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15513.62s">[Callahan]</a>: And thank you for giving me the opportunity to restate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20294.625s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20295.145s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you, we are voting to do what exactly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2076.954s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2077.394s">[Callahan]</a>: I apologize to my fellow Councilors for not submitting mine in a timely manner, but I want to, first of all, just state my agreements with points that other folks have brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2091.044s">[Callahan]</a>: One is level funding for Medford public schools, including those positions that have been paid for with funds that may be ending or may have ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2100.031s">[Callahan]</a>: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli's request for a DPW hardtop group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2107.12s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to make sure that we maintain our funding for community liaisons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2113.116s">[Callahan]</a>: The elections department needs to be fully funded as it was in the past with an elections director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2118.961s">[Callahan]</a>: I definitely agree with everyone that the city solicitor and assistant city solicitor salaries need to be increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2124.367s">[Callahan]</a>: We need to find those people and fill those positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2130.433s">[Callahan]</a>: And then two that I think have not been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2133.796s">[Callahan]</a>: One is our tree planting budget should equal an amount<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2137.475s">[Callahan]</a>: that can fund the amount needed to plant the number of trees that Medford loses per year, whatever best estimate that is we have for like a five year average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2149.54s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to see a, this is not exactly a budget request but it's like information that I think needs to come along with the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2156.623s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2158.843s">[Callahan]</a>: We have requested from the administration an explanation of what our five-year plan is for fixing our roads and sidewalks and how that matches with the pavement report, pavement management study, and the sidewalk study that were done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2174.166s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that we need to see a five-year plan so that we can understand how the upcoming budget fits into this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2182.528s">[Callahan]</a>: At a minimum,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2184.088s">[Callahan]</a>: If that plan is not ready in time, the budget for roads and sidewalks should come with an explanation of what is going to be accomplished with the funds just for this year as compared to the plans from the pavement management study and the sidewalk study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2200.51s">[Callahan]</a>: So those are mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2201.432s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2204.85s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sorry, I do have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2207.351s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there, for example, if there were creative ideas that came from the community about how we can support our local small businesses, is there some sort of a fund where small amounts of money like $2,000, $4,000, those kinds of things can come out of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2242.004s">[Callahan]</a>: I would request there be a small slush fund for, you know, creative events and other ideas that can help our local small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2252.111s">[Callahan]</a>: We're talking like 10k maybe for an entire year, just very small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2263.28s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, we're talking small, but you could do some interesting events and things with 10K.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2268.023s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3891.693s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3893.073s">[Callahan]</a>: So I hear this sort of coming up with five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3897.655s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm curious, what do our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3901.815s">[Callahan]</a>: boil down recommendations look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3903.857s">[Callahan]</a>: Are we supposed to come up with five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3905.378s">[Callahan]</a>: It doesn't say anything about that in the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3910.543s">[Callahan]</a>: What are we expecting this to look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3912.684s">[Callahan]</a>: How many is too many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3915.627s">[Callahan]</a>: What do we want?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4221.135s">[Callahan]</a>: I wanted to ask, should I email mine, or is it okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4224.718s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you have reasonable notes from what I said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=896.169s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=897.169s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm really happy to see these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=898.71s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the readability is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=900.63s">[Callahan]</a>: I remember hearing from some constituents that they felt that it was more lenient on the municipality than it was on residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=908.532s">[Callahan]</a>: And this, I think it wasn't, but I think this reading of it makes it really clear that actually it's stricter on the commercial owners and the municipality than it is on residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=920.036s">[Callahan]</a>: So I only have one very small question, which is about the use of wheeled leaf blowers powered by four stroke engines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=927.063s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm sure there's a good reason why they're carved out from any sort of phase out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=930.987s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm curious what that reason is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=932.968s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I'm wondering if there is any phase out for those planned or if we're just, you know, maybe there's a reason why there's no plant phase out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=983.172s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1776.095s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, could we say, you know, the user of the leaf blower?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1897.091s">[Callahan]</a>: Suggesting suggesting each year by September 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3601.011s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just wanted to add to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3603.192s">[Callahan]</a>: But in addition to there being plenty of studies showing that over the life of the product, it is environmentally more responsible to use electric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3611.496s">[Callahan]</a>: It should be noted that battery technology changes and changes fairly quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3617.338s">[Callahan]</a>: So when we're talking about lithium batteries, the design of an electric leaf blower is different from the design of a gas powered leaf blower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3626.262s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3627.603s">[Callahan]</a>: convert now to electric as battery technology improves, we will be able to more easily get the benefit of those new batteries, which, you know, I'm sure will be environmentally more sustainable because people are not quite aware of the problems with lithium batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4316.181s">[Callahan]</a>: No, yeah I am seconding but I'd also like to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4318.683s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4319.363s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, I just want to comment that there have been many public meetings on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4324.027s">[Callahan]</a>: There have been many, there have been dozens of people speaking very eloquently in favor of passing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4330.712s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally believe that there are more residents in Medford, who are incredibly frustrated with both the noise and pollution of gas leaf blowers than there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4341.079s">[Callahan]</a>: people who do not want this ordinance to be this to move out of committee and to move to the City Council for passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4348.881s">[Callahan]</a>: And I also really want to reiterate that the very well respected institutions and scientists in climate science have studied whether<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4364.025s">[Callahan]</a>: battery powered leaf blowers or gas powered leaf blowers are which one is environmentally better in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4370.987s">[Callahan]</a>: And they have determined that electric powered gas blowers are better for the environment in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4376.949s">[Callahan]</a>: And they include all sorts of things in that determination, including the dangers of lithium batteries, including, you know, all the metals that go into those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4385.032s">[Callahan]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4385.652s">[Callahan]</a>: We do not need to debate things here and talk about individual metals that go into them because we are not those experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4391.854s">[Callahan]</a>: Those experts have come to conclusions and those conclusions are that it's better to use electric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4398.736s">[Callahan]</a>: And I certainly do believe that between the environmental impact and the noise pollution, that this is what, passing this is what the majority of Medford's and residents want, which is why I support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1770.509s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1771.55s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really commend the CPC for all the work that you do and, you know, the whole approval process and researching all these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1779.334s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to understand a little bit better the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1782.035s">[Callahan]</a>: So there are applications that come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1785.697s">[Callahan]</a>: Are those applications ones that have been, do people go through the planning department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1792.16s">[Callahan]</a>: Is it all simply, are these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1795.532s">[Callahan]</a>: organizations coming to you directly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1798.916s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there what is and I guess what I'm asking about is I've been hearing from constituents about sort of equity across the city, folks in Barrie Park, Barrie Park playground, thinking that they maybe are not getting as much attention and as much funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1813.931s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm just curious if like who who's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1817.614s">[Callahan]</a>: job would it be to look across the city and determine which of these sort of resurfacing projects or any of these projects are the ones that are most needed and ensure that those applications are getting in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10.869s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15.913s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2715.779s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2716.999s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to really thank all of the people who reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2720.42s">[Callahan]</a>: I have received more emails on this topic than I've probably on any other topic and spoken to a number of firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2729.682s">[Callahan]</a>: And honestly, my position on this, I am finding it extremely difficult to believe that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2740.044s">[Callahan]</a>: a healthy fire department filled with people who want to do their jobs, respect their leaders, and are, you know, doing the best that they can here in Medford in this incredibly difficult job is going to be helped by a process that almost to a T, like every single one of them does not want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2765.489s">[Callahan]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2769.001s">[Callahan]</a>: If we are looking, that is just very difficult for me to believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2774.044s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to make sure that whatever process that we have for selecting, and it was very interesting to me to hear, and I really dug into the process and how it has worked in the past, and how people are satisfied with it, and why it is that this particular process that the fire department has builds trust, builds respect, builds a really good, as Councilor Lemmie said, morale,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2798.802s">[Callahan]</a>: And I am finding it very difficult to believe that a process that every firefighter does not want is going to get better leadership into the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2813.288s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's where I start from, but I'm open ears and I'm very interested in hearing from everyone who is here to speak about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2821.692s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10399.309s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, and thanks so much to everyone who has come tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10404.172s">[Callahan]</a>: I consider myself to be a pro-worker and pro-union person, and I know that there are other Councilors on this council who agree with that statement about themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10417.4s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the absolute minimum that we can do if we are pro-worker, pro-union people, is to not make this permanent change<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10427.208s">[Callahan]</a>: to essentially at will employment based solely on flimsy corporate arguments and a totally unproven allegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10437.491s">[Callahan]</a>: So from the arguments standpoint, I have heard a number of things tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10444.899s">[Callahan]</a>: and things like this process should not be hamstrung by all sorts of bureaucratic blah blah blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10455.909s">[Callahan]</a>: It sure is real simple when you can fire anybody for no reason and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10464.113s">[Callahan]</a>: Process is something that helps us have good democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10467.475s">[Callahan]</a>: It helps us have good workplaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10470.597s">[Callahan]</a>: I do not think that this argument of needing to have a quick process is one that I would agree with or that vibes with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10480.443s">[Callahan]</a>: This idea that we need leadership that is most qualified, that we're going to find the best candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10485.066s">[Callahan]</a>: I talked at length with firefighters who described the process, the civil service process, and believe me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10493.47s">[Callahan]</a>: Having a mayor select someone is not merit-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10497.996s">[Callahan]</a>: If you want the best candidate or most qualified candidate, then you're going to go with a civil service process because that in fact is totally merit-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10510.625s">[Callahan]</a>: And this question that this decision does not affect other people in the department is, frankly, totally not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10519.691s">[Callahan]</a>: It is true to say that it does not remove those other people from civil service, but it totally affects them, aside from the fact that all these promotions, you know, would, you know, waterfall down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10533.78s">[Callahan]</a>: and affect a lot of people every time there would be a new fire chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10540.243s">[Callahan]</a>: That, of course, is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10541.284s">[Callahan]</a>: But if you want to know if it affects the department, look around the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10544.465s">[Callahan]</a>: It affects the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10545.826s">[Callahan]</a>: Why else are all of these people here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10547.747s">[Callahan]</a>: And as far as the allegation, you know, I am very concerned that we are being pushed into this decision based on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10558.152s">[Callahan]</a>: a totally unproven allegation that the mayor herself says she doesn't even have any idea why these people would do a coordinated sick out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10569.496s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, people don't do a coordinated, like, they don't through their union coordinate to all be sick at the same time without a demand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10577.278s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't, like, that just isn't the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10580.96s">[Callahan]</a>: And the other thing about being sick is that, you know, diseases are contagious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.283s">[Callahan]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10588.783s">[Callahan]</a>: So people all get sick at the same time when they work in the same place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10591.385s">[Callahan]</a>: That is normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10593.526s">[Callahan]</a>: And you can think what you want about that particular instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10597.488s">[Callahan]</a>: But whatever you think, there is no proven anything going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10603.37s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is not the time for us to make this kind of decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10608.973s">[Callahan]</a>: It also I really have to urge Councilors to understand that there is not one firefighter that is in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10617.76s">[Callahan]</a>: And I am, again, as I said at the beginning, really boggles my mind how we could possibly improve our fire department with leadership that they themselves will refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10629.569s">[Callahan]</a>: It simply does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10633.112s">[Callahan]</a>: So I am not in favor of this, and I don't think that it helps us to move this to a committee where we'll discuss it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10642.338s">[Callahan]</a>: I have made my decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10644.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10901.819s">[Callahan]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10906.882s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11941.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=42.409s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1121.778s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1122.919s">[Callahan]</a>: I have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1125.0s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I don't, I don't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1126.621s">[Callahan]</a>: So there are seven different Home Rule petitions listed, potential Home Rule petitions listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1134.825s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have any actual legal language for any of these seven?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1201.977s">[Callahan]</a>: My second question, if I may, if I may just ask my second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1205.458s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just wanted to double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1207.298s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are, right now we're not discussing the other six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1210.739s">[Callahan]</a>: We're discussing the rent stabilization, which is referenced in a separate email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1221.561s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1223.481s">[Callahan]</a>: We're only discussing the rent stabilization today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1225.742s">[Callahan]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1226.682s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2818.84s">[Callahan]</a>: No, really, President Bayer said what I was going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2821.502s">[Callahan]</a>: I think the person who wrote in that was read in public comment misunderstood what is in this draft with the idea that currently you can evict people for any reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2835.732s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we change that, that doesn't mean that you can't evict them for any reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2839.455s">[Callahan]</a>: There are many reasons that you certainly can evict people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2842.557s">[Callahan]</a>: You can evict them if they don't pay their rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2844.218s">[Callahan]</a>: You can evict them if they have a cat and that's against the lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2846.68s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, any of these things are perfectly valid reasons to evict someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2849.822s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think there was a misunderstanding and I hope that that came through in President Bears's message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2855.806s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3158.28s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1282.944s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1287.386s">[Callahan]</a>: So yes, these are a number of pro-democracy reforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1291.929s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to clarify for folks what I mean by pro-democracy reforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1298.212s">[Callahan]</a>: These are things that ideally would help Medford have more people voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1306.716s">[Callahan]</a>: have better actual voting rates throughout our population and or would allow for people who tend to be underserved by government and underrepresented to be better represented and better served.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1328.965s">[Callahan]</a>: There are many of these that we could consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1331.147s">[Callahan]</a>: These are the ones that I think that we can consider most easily as a city council in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1337.712s">[Callahan]</a>: So the reason why the salaries for elected officials are prioritized is because if any salaries are going to be raised<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1351.442s">[Callahan]</a>: then I personally would prefer, even though this isn't a law on our books, there are cities in Massachusetts and in other places around the country that have laws that say that if salaries are going to be raised, that they need to be decided in the first 18 months of the term, and they cannot take effect until the next term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1374.114s">[Callahan]</a>: So the idea of having a recommendation finished by December 31st,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1379.236s">[Callahan]</a>: out of this committee means that the council could then make a decision before June, which would be within the first 18 months of the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1388.7s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the reason behind that particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1391.461s">[Callahan]</a>: But I will say there is no rush on any of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1394.583s">[Callahan]</a>: Nothing needs to be decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1395.803s">[Callahan]</a>: There's also no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1397.904s">[Callahan]</a>: There's no legal language on any of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1399.585s">[Callahan]</a>: So this really is just an opening discussion and no rush on any of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1405.05s">[Callahan]</a>: There's no particular timeline for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1407.092s">[Callahan]</a>: So whenever it pleases this particular committee to put them on the agenda, I would be happy to appear again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1492.156s">[Callahan]</a>: From the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1497.046s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1498.027s">[Callahan]</a>: In our last meeting, not the last meeting, but one of the meetings we had yesterday, I believe that the clerk said that if we receive and place on file, then we're essentially putting it away to not look at again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1513.793s">[Callahan]</a>: We have to reopen it if we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1516.714s">[Callahan]</a>: Doesn't this just remain as something that is, don't we need to not receive and place this on file?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1524.498s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm asking maybe the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1529.419s">[Callahan]</a>: I am, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=70.983s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=74.424s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=193.029s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks, I was just saying if you prefer to do these other two first, we can, because we know the better, then we can have more general discussion after, but then we can just move to move 006 to after those, if you prefer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=205.815s">[Callahan]</a>: But I also am fine if we do the sort of general discussion first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=220.578s">[Callahan]</a>: Perhaps we move it to move 006 to the end and we get your stuff, do all of your stuff, and then 006, if there's anything left over in 006, we can cover it at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=711.602s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep, I was just curious if, like, if we have a subcommittee, are only people who are on this committee allowed to be on the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=719.265s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's a question for Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=725.267s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm curious, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1338.916s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1340.097s">[Callahan]</a>: So I definitely think it's, I love the idea of having something that is, you know, unbiased, sort of lets people know about what has been passed recently, and especially opportunities for people to get engaged before things are passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1356.489s">[Callahan]</a>: That's the part I'm most excited about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1357.97s">[Callahan]</a>: I am,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1361.232s">[Callahan]</a>: Curious if we have talked to the communications department and seen whether we can sort of fold this into what they're doing, like we come up with sort of the brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1373.159s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I don't think it has to be long either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1375.641s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we're talking, it's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1379.824s">[Callahan]</a>: And then, I don't know, can you quick answer that before I make a couple more comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1389.57s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1447.196s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1448.037s">[Callahan]</a>: Just to finish up, I'm someone who thinks very deeply and has for seven or eight years thought very deeply about how to engage people who are not currently engaged in city politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1462.556s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not worried that if we send it to some people, there are people who aren't getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1467.438s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that's the way all newsletters are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1469.479s">[Callahan]</a>: You start with with the people who you know you can access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1473.721s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think this kind of update is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1478.143s">[Callahan]</a>: just trying to get a certain piece of information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1481.725s">[Callahan]</a>: The question of how do you engage more people, I think, is something that we reach differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1486.708s">[Callahan]</a>: That's not what we discuss now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1488.289s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what we discussed specifically when we were discussing, hey, how do we reach those people and bring them into any of these discussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1497.435s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, that's what the meetings with underrepresented groups is really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1501.838s">[Callahan]</a>: dedicated to as well as the community liaisons and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1505.599s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not, I'm not really concerned about, you know, having a newsletter that does not go to every single person in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1511.162s">[Callahan]</a>: I think you start, you know, that's how newsletters are, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1513.202s">[Callahan]</a>: You start with what you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1515.663s">[Callahan]</a>: I just, I would love it if we can also talk to the communications department and see if that's one of the avenues that, you know, we can sort of fold this into if it's something nice and simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1526.027s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2978.706s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3133.665s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3134.585s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just hoping because I know we're short on time, but it would be great if the ordinance those that are listed here would major partisan ordinances if someone could simply give like a very basic sort of status of those that would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=732.959s">[Callahan]</a>: public works facilities convened, and we have discussed ways that we can keep up to date on the roads and sidewalks, as well as all of the buildings that the city owns in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=745.567s">[Callahan]</a>: We are excited to keep the public informed of how these efforts are moving forward with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2492.194s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Leming spoke quite well on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2495.297s">[Callahan]</a>: Really, this is a, remember, this is a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2497.579s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not an ordinance that we are passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2499.661s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a statement of the views of the council on not prioritizing our law enforcement to spend resources, to arrest and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2515.336s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, sent for incarceration, people who simply have possession of such controlled substances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2524.26s">[Callahan]</a>: So given that and what Councilor Leming said, I believe this resolution is a fairly reasonable state and there are many other cities that have passed something very similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3326.24s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3327.361s">[Callahan]</a>: As a co sponsor of this, it clearly is important to me that we do consider the spirit of what we're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3337.052s">[Callahan]</a>: But I also want to mention that this is a fairly long resolution, and it includes a couple of state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3344.076s">[Callahan]</a>: recommendations about state policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3346.437s">[Callahan]</a>: And I want to ensure that other Councilors have had the time to consider those policies and to consider the entire text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3355.122s">[Callahan]</a>: And that I also mentioned this because I am the first in the alphabet, which means that I have to state what I'm going to do first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3364.307s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's simply to say to my fellow Councilors that I would definitely respect people's desires to have time and committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3373.001s">[Callahan]</a>: to understand the issue more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3374.723s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will, as a co-sponsor, make sure that this does move through committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3379.968s">[Callahan]</a>: But I just want to state that I'd love to hear from other Councilors in terms of whether sending it to committee is something that you would prefer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4310.791s">[Callahan]</a>: Because I work for a 501C3 organization that takes a position on a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, among other things, I have filed a disclosure form with the city clerk, but I have been advised by the State Ethics Commission that I am able to vote on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11191.067s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11192.048s">[Callahan]</a>: I so appreciate everyone who is involved in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11195.77s">[Callahan]</a>: And I want to say, just for a moment, about the amended language, that that is actually part of the democratic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11203.874s">[Callahan]</a>: So the original language that was posted was there for people to interact with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11210.478s">[Callahan]</a>: That is why it was there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11212.359s">[Callahan]</a>: It wasn't there to remain untouched until we arrived here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11217.34s">[Callahan]</a>: It was there so that people could be involved in democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11221.101s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I'll direct my comments to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11223.822s">[Callahan]</a>: Could be involved in democracy and they did, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11226.963s">[Callahan]</a>: They reached out to Councilor Collins and probably to, I certainly had someone reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11232.364s">[Callahan]</a>: People reached out to the councilors and to the sponsor of this particular resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11239.426s">[Callahan]</a>: to state what they wanted, their vision of what they wanted this to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11244.688s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know that many, many people did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11247.069s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's where the amended language came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11250.17s">[Callahan]</a>: So I don't want people to think that we are simply looking at amended language that sprung out of one of our minds without input, and that we're voting on it without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11261.755s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11262.956s">[Callahan]</a>: But this was something that really was worked on by many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11267.1s">[Callahan]</a>: I appreciate all of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11268.702s">[Callahan]</a>: I appreciate all of the time of everyone who has been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11272.105s">[Callahan]</a>: It is well worth our staying up late for the things that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11279.372s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really appreciate that and just wanted to chat for a minute about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11285.137s">[Callahan]</a>: how much I appreciate people being involved in our democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11288.358s">[Callahan]</a>: I do hope that folks will come back and will stay on top of the things that are coming up in the city council and will reach out to us before they're voted on to help us make them better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14683.914s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to mention for anyone watching, listening or in the chambers that this is a resolution that simply sends it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14690.077s">[Callahan]</a>: This is an opening of the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14691.978s">[Callahan]</a>: So if people are interested in this topic, please come to the committee meetings where this will be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14697.541s">[Callahan]</a>: Same with the warming center, same with some of these other resolutions that were passed today and maybe passed later today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14703.524s">[Callahan]</a>: This is really the beginning of the discussion, certainly not the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14707.246s">[Callahan]</a>: And we really encourage people to come to those committee meetings because that is where the sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14711.508s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, meat and potatoes of developing laws for our city comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15972.526s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to mention that in one of the committees, perhaps you can remind me which one, we were talking about the importance of holding companies accountable for any damages that they do, or for following through on their promises of things that they've committed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15987.636s">[Callahan]</a>: And I see this as part of that ongoing work, but we will be, as a city, we will be doing more to be proactive about these kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16239.453s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16240.254s">[Callahan]</a>: Um, yes, as I mentioned earlier today in this committee, we have discussed getting updates from the administration on roads on sidewalks and on all publicly owned buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16253.719s">[Callahan]</a>: We also have a new facilities manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16256.0s">[Callahan]</a>: So we feel this is a really nice way for them to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16262.563s">[Callahan]</a>: themselves situated in terms of what all of the city owned buildings are, what state of repair they're in, how much might cost to repair them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16270.765s">[Callahan]</a>: So, this is just something that we're, you know, putting forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16275.867s">[Callahan]</a>: And we think that it will both be beneficial to the city and also be beneficial to the facilities manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16500.163s">[Callahan]</a>: This resolution really is all about just getting the information that we need to make decisions like that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16848.967s">[Callahan]</a>: I was just gonna say, I worked on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16852.348s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16854.909s">[Callahan]</a>: I do, as a general rule, I think councilors should take time to understand everything in everything that we pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16862.552s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know that there's some state laws involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16866.313s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's why I just wanted to know, but I'm perfectly happy to pass tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1.149s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=32.107s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry, I cannot hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=33.388s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you move the thing onto the podium, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=35.088s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=37.51s">[Callahan]</a>: With air conditioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=38.45s">[Callahan]</a>: Is this better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=316.247s">[Callahan]</a>: I just was hoping that we can, for all of these, have a status in each of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=322.152s">[Callahan]</a>: I think it's super helpful to have a status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=323.934s">[Callahan]</a>: So even zoning reform, it's helpful for us, but also for the public to know, oh, there was zoning reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=331.96s">[Callahan]</a>: There was a minor zoning reform that happened last cycle, but we expect to be doing more major zoning reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=341.82s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think even for any of the ordinances and things, even if it's not started, it would be great to have a status put in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=359.951s">[Callahan]</a>: So status being things like not started,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=366.926s">[Callahan]</a>: proposed, like I don't know what they all are going to be, but like a status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=371.048s">[Callahan]</a>: And if there's anything that can be easily put into like a short sentence for people to give people any context around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=576.615s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=577.115s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=578.276s">[Callahan]</a>: Would it be helpful under descriptions and goals if we actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=584.491s">[Callahan]</a>: called out housing production plan section 5B to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the climate action plan 2.2.D, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=595.414s">[Callahan]</a>: So rather than these generic implement Medford Comprehensive Plan, which even I who have read the Medford Comprehensive Plan don't, that's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=606.036s">[Callahan]</a>: Would that be a helpful way for us to have a full list, even though I know that would be long?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=613.354s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there a way for us to maybe each of us take things that we're like, I'm trying to figure out how we can break this into chunks to make it into like a list of things that we actually want to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2249.682s">[Callahan]</a>: So these are definitely out of the climate adaptation and action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2258.028s">[Callahan]</a>: Really, the energy disclosure and benchmarking are kind of linked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2262.93s">[Callahan]</a>: So what other cities have done is to first start with having buildings, usually large buildings above a certain amount, have required energy disclosure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2279.114s">[Callahan]</a>: And then after that, after they've been doing that for a few years, then the city can benchmark certain energy goals and have fines for buildings that are not meeting those goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2295.804s">[Callahan]</a>: So it is definitely part of the same, it would be part of, I believe, the same ordinance that would have one thing for a few years and then benchmarking part of it for the next few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2425.852s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2426.332s">[Callahan]</a>: You just reminded me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2427.193s">[Callahan]</a>: I also had a talk with Brenda and Alicia about this and heard that the state may be working on something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2435.24s">[Callahan]</a>: The state's version will only apply to very large buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2439.704s">[Callahan]</a>: I think our first step is really to investigate, number one, what the state is working on and number two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2447.449s">[Callahan]</a>: how quickly that might be done, because being someone who actually knows quite a lot about how state politics works, I know that it could be 10 or 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2455.491s">[Callahan]</a>: So we need to understand whether they're actually going to accomplish something or if this is just something that is, you know, quote unquote, being worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2462.233s">[Callahan]</a>: And then number three, if whatever law they are working on is even going to have any impact in Medford, given the size of most of our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2471.314s">[Callahan]</a>: And if not, then we want to consider what could we do that might be like a slightly smaller building size or how we could have impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2480.996s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm super passionate about this because two thirds of our emissions are from buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2486.497s">[Callahan]</a>: And so this is really and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2491.198s">[Callahan]</a>: There's like a half a percent gain in buildings per year, maybe, maybe less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2495.819s">[Callahan]</a>: So we cannot affect this carbon emissions through new buildings and new construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2501.143s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, there's new construction on old buildings, but if we really want to get at our carbon emissions, this is something we'll have to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2537.446s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep, I can speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2538.847s">[Callahan]</a>: It's basically something that will allow us to reach both some of our climate goals as well as some of our affordable housing goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2545.57s">[Callahan]</a>: It just means that if you're a landlord renting units that you would have to register with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2551.874s">[Callahan]</a>: Pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2553.555s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2832.009s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure this energy retrofits for existing buildings is really right out of the climate action adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2838.792s">[Callahan]</a>: It's supposed to be something that the planning department is doing this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2844.417s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe started last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2846.239s">[Callahan]</a>: I think they're actually going to start this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2848.04s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think we just want to have our eyes on it and ensure that that effort is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3412.227s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are other things to do with that before we look at any zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3415.288s">[Callahan]</a>: We have to look at the state legislation and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=5.206s">[Callahan]</a>: Hello, welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=6.006s">[Callahan]</a>: We are convening the Medford City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee meeting for January 31st, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=11.849s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=30.762s">[Callahan]</a>: present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=33.704s">[Callahan]</a>: And I want to recognize Emily Lazzaro as our vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=40.25s">[Callahan]</a>: We will go on to the action and discussion items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=45.594s">[Callahan]</a>: And the primary one here is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=48.826s">[Callahan]</a>: is 24-006 offered by Isaac bears Council President, the resolution that each council committee review the 2024 2025 Council governing agenda as amended at the January 24 2024 committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=66.84s">[Callahan]</a>: So we do have that agenda in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=71.522s">[Callahan]</a>: And as with the other committee meetings, we can go ahead and just run through those items to discuss how we are going to move forward on them for the next year or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=86.23s">[Callahan]</a>: We will start with our major projects, and I'll start with the street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=93.592s">[Callahan]</a>: and sidewalk repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=94.032s">[Callahan]</a>: Um while we don't implement street and sidewalk repair as a city council, um, we do want to be, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=102.817s">[Callahan]</a>: Aware of and to also provide residents some awareness of what the city is planning to do in terms of street and sidewalk repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=112.582s">[Callahan]</a>: And one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=118.863s">[Callahan]</a>: the administration, which of the proposed plans in the 2021 payment management study we have chosen, or if we haven't chosen any of those plans specifically, then what are our plans for the next five years, including both the funding as well as which streets or category of streets we will be repairing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=143.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Comments from city councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=147.79s">[Callahan]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=268.487s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you think that we can request that for a month from now when we have our next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=295.582s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, do we have, this is a motion, do we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=298.904s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=302.645s">[Callahan]</a>: Seconds the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=304.256s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=578.01s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=579.171s">[Callahan]</a>: I love that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=580.892s">[Callahan]</a>: I might suggest that we add to this motion that we have a report back not only on the pavement management,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=588.539s">[Callahan]</a>: study, which is specifically roads, but there's also a sidewalk study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=592.56s">[Callahan]</a>: So maybe that belongs in it and then maybe a separate motion for a comparison of the price of having our own sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=603.684s">[Callahan]</a>: And yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=786.718s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=823.065s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=823.425s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there more discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=824.125s">[Callahan]</a>: Do people feel comfortable, even though this is a very long motion, do people feel comfortable voting on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=853.351s">[Callahan]</a>: But I believe that currently we're only considering your motion right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=856.992s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=864.312s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, any more discussion on the first motion of President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=869.854s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=871.554s">[Callahan]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=872.895s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=875.516s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, do you want to make that motion now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=985.602s">[Callahan]</a>: Does it go boing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=995.908s">[Callahan]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=996.248s">[Callahan]</a>: Any more discussion on this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=998.709s">[Callahan]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1001.953s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1003.494s">[Callahan]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1004.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1006.474s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, let's go ahead and breeze through some of these other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1010.055s">[Callahan]</a>: We have one under City Facilities and Equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1012.216s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there anyone who wants to speak on this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1400.094s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1402.256s">[Callahan]</a>: I completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1403.517s">[Callahan]</a>: I think having some sort of assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1408.54s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do think that if with a new facilities manager, that is exactly the time for them to be given a task like this, as long as they have enough time, because it really sets them on the right path of being aware of all of our facilities and the shape that each one of them is in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1422.551s">[Callahan]</a>: It'll help them to get all that information on board quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1429.498s">[Callahan]</a>: Any other discussion around this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1433.18s">[Callahan]</a>: Moving on to public restrooms in Parks and Squares, and Councilor Tseng is not here, but it is fairly self-descriptive, just developing plans to have more public restrooms in our parks and squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1448.31s">[Callahan]</a>: Moving on to ordinances, is there any discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1450.631s">[Callahan]</a>: We're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1453.313s">[Callahan]</a>: Ordinances, the lead ordinance, Councilor Beres, do you want to introduce this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1510.905s">[Callahan]</a>: Any discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1521.886s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1522.446s">[Callahan]</a>: Moving on to a homeown petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1526.51s">[Callahan]</a>: This is Vice President Collins taking the lead on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1530.333s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there anyone that wants to introduce this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1537.879s">[Callahan]</a>: That's what rings in my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1612.103s">[Callahan]</a>: Any other discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1615.094s">[Callahan]</a>: Moving on to the oversight and engagement, public utility accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1621.781s">[Callahan]</a>: Cerulli is looking at holding utility companies accountable to provide services and benefits to the community and mitigate impact of their assets and poor asset condition on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1871.798s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you for mentioning that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1873.919s">[Callahan]</a>: It also reminds me that I heard this same thing that you say that you have heard for many years I also heard this talking to neighbors at their doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1884.523s">[Callahan]</a>: And also I wonder if we can fold into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1887.745s">[Callahan]</a>: to understand from the administration how much coordination there is, because in some other cities, they put a moratorium once a road is truly repaved and brought up to like a number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1902.384s">[Callahan]</a>: And my understanding is that then there are a lot of emergencies, and that this happens all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1907.268s">[Callahan]</a>: So to really have an understanding from the administration of what that moratorium is, what can get in the way of it, how often it happens, that, in fact, it's torn up much more quickly than every five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1919.598s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think that might fold into that, or it could be separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1922.68s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2251.823s">[Callahan]</a>: So there, yes, Councilor Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2336.151s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion on the floor and as we read it back, if you wanna, no, no, just let me know if you think it makes any sense to add in something about the moratorium and how often it is broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2349.059s">[Callahan]</a>: So let's go ahead and read that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2389.051s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we want to have a second for this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2398.577s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2400.378s">[Callahan]</a>: We can always add my stuff as a different motion or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2422.818s">[Callahan]</a>: Any more discussion on the Councilor Scarapelli's motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2426.943s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2427.863s">[Callahan]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2428.344s">[Callahan]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2429.344s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2432.786s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, we are near the end here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2485.29s">[Callahan]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2487.671s">[Callahan]</a>: All right, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2488.411s">[Callahan]</a>: Already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2505.719s">[Callahan]</a>: Do you want to read that back, and then we'll take a vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2508.341s">[Callahan]</a>: We'll have a discussion and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2522.78s">[Callahan]</a>: Any discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2524.901s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2525.401s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2527.682s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2528.942s">[Callahan]</a>: The final thing on our list is simply the tree planting volunteer network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2535.185s">[Callahan]</a>: That is really something that we're at a very early phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2538.629s">[Callahan]</a>: We're just at the point of like talking to city staff and kind of seeing, you know, they're like talking to city staff and also looking at what other cities have done just to get an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2550.824s">[Callahan]</a>: So we're not, I think, at the point of any kind of an ordinance or taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2556.271s">[Callahan]</a>: So the idea is that the city would allow certain volunteers, residents to, with training, with the proper placement, with the proper trees, with the proper depth, and with all the training to be enabled to participate in the planting of certain city trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2629.397s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2630.578s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do think also that as a, like if this becomes something of a resolution or who knows what exactly it will become, that it will be for, it's kind of stopgap measure, that the purpose really is to have a larger tree planting crew, but that at the moment, while we are dealing with budgetary difficulties, that this might be able to help us to increase our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2653.08s">[Callahan]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2807.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Does anybody have an idea for what is the next step for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2858.309s">[Callahan]</a>: Do we have any other public comment, any discussion of anything else as we've reached the end of our sort of list of things that we hope to cover in this committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2879.887s">[Callahan]</a>: What we were just talking about just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2884.5s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2886.161s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, 19-554, resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2894.604s">[Callahan]</a>: It was discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2898.786s">[Callahan]</a>: I did not call it from my chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2913.696s">[Callahan]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2914.476s">[Callahan]</a>: Please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2918.737s">[Callahan]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2919.898s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you state your name and address for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3161.587s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that our clerk actually has some some answers for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3264.821s">[Callahan]</a>: Well, unfortunately, I think that the reason this has been stalled for six years is because it's really up to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3269.591s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not something that we can decide and our administration can implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3315.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3318.644s">[Callahan]</a>: No, we can't because it's really up to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3320.365s">[Callahan]</a>: So we don't have any control over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3322.645s">[Callahan]</a>: So what we're suggesting is that we reach out again to our state representatives to ask them for some information, but it's nothing that we are able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3336.79s">[Callahan]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3343.052s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3344.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3351.967s">[Callahan]</a>: Fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3352.728s">[Callahan]</a>: Any other public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3491.788s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3615.58s">[Callahan]</a>: OK, all rants aside, cut you off, President Perkins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3627.697s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there any other discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3629.938s">[Callahan]</a>: No, there's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3630.598s">[Callahan]</a>: Does anyone move to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3645.906s">[Callahan]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3646.126s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion to adjourn from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Zach Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3648.687s">[Callahan]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3649.407s">[Callahan]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3650.048s">[Callahan]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3650.728s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3651.528s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=3653.649s">[Callahan]</a>: See you all next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=513.255s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious about procedure, and I know that the committees were different in the last cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=518.638s">[Callahan]</a>: These tree preservation leaf blower, which seem like they might be under environment, are they in Committee of the Whole because of the change of structure of the committees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=526.383s">[Callahan]</a>: Or is there a reason why things might go to Committee of the Whole rather than be in a specific other committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=652.638s">[Callahan]</a>: I appreciate that the current status is in there, so we can, we don't even need to ask, like, we can see immediately, like, what is it waiting on, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=890.768s">[Callahan]</a>: I was so excited to see the percent for art ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1052.33s">[Callahan]</a>: Will there be an updated digital copy of this regularly as things change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1398.436s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to bring up two ideas that came up as I was knocking on doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1402.14s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope to, you know, encourage these to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1406.705s">[Callahan]</a>: One is to encourage our schools to offer more opportunities for our children to spend in the fells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1417.457s">[Callahan]</a>: and in nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1418.298s">[Callahan]</a>: And the other one that I got from a 10-year-old at the doors is called Lemonade Stand Days, where we send out a text message to everyone in the city saying, if you're a kid, get your lemonade stand ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1430.247s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're a grown-up, put cash in your pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1433.95s">[Callahan]</a>: The night before any day, it's going to be over 90 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2199.824s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to highlight that the energy disclosure and benchmarking ordinances, I'm happy to take, to kind of review that and look, because certain things have to happen before other things, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2211.079s">[Callahan]</a>: Anyway, if you want to put my name there, you can, on the Energy Disclosure, just because I want to work together with Patel in terms of looking at those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2826.015s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2826.675s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm going to bring up another idea that I heard while I was knocking on doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2830.678s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not at the point of writing an ordinance yet, but simply at the point of having discussions with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2837.103s">[Callahan]</a>: Someone asked if we could pass something allowing folks to have chickens in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2841.586s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know that the way other cities do it, it's a certain number per lake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2847.251s">[Callahan]</a>: or nine blocks or whatever that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2850.173s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's not like anyone can have as many chickens as they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2852.754s">[Callahan]</a>: So, but again, not ordinance stage, simply curiosity because someone mentioned it when I was knocking on their door to see if this is something that the people in Medford are interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3251.637s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3252.997s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, I'm excited to dig into these and to work with the committee to prioritize these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3260.24s">[Callahan]</a>: I do want to say I'm happy to put the public utility accountability if you want to put my name as the lead councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3265.002s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3266.243s">[Callahan]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3267.984s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm also really grateful for seeing the lead ordinance on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3271.823s">[Callahan]</a>: That was on all of my original material that I knocked on doors with in May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3277.726s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm very happy to see that there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3280.808s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, that's it for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3459.192s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanna make sure that people, that we understood you correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3461.674s">[Callahan]</a>: You're talking about municipal energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3464.037s">[Callahan]</a>: It says you broke up a little bit right then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3465.398s">[Callahan]</a>: Renewable energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3466.639s">[Callahan]</a>: Renewable energy or municipal energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3470.923s">[Callahan]</a>: I think he was talking about municipal energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3474.306s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, which I think is very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4014.372s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4015.533s">[Callahan]</a>: And I so appreciate this being brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4020.39s">[Callahan]</a>: Given our discussion right now, and discussions that I had many times at people's doors over the summer and fall, I would love to organize one meeting of this Public Works and Facilities Committee that is devoted to discussing private ways with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4040.829s">[Callahan]</a>: Hopefully we can have a lot of lead time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4043.533s">[Callahan]</a>: We can also come up with some written understanding of the history of private ways, how they became what they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4053.957s">[Callahan]</a>: I would love to do something like that, so I don't think we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4059.681s">[Callahan]</a>: It's something that will require a lot of preparation for, but I do think that that would be beneficial for our community, for people to be able to come and discuss the issue as a whole with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4206.548s">[Callahan]</a>: I would lean toward a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4208.938s">[Callahan]</a>: A debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4210.519s">[Callahan]</a>: Like a real big public campaign for a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4213.661s">[Callahan]</a>: Everybody knows exactly what it's for and the public gets to decide whether or not to do that for the people who live in the city and yet do not get a lot of the services that everybody else gets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4224.649s">[Callahan]</a>: Really could be a question of equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4228.211s">[Callahan]</a>: And then the voters are deciding and we're not doing anything that is not, we're not making the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4234.395s">[Callahan]</a>: Voters are making the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4247.751s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that the $64 million question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4509.735s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4510.435s">[Callahan]</a>: As I was looking through our whole governing framework, I noticed that there wasn't any obvious place to put a lot of the revitalizing our squares work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4522.537s">[Callahan]</a>: And I thought about the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee as a good place where we might be able to do some of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4528.778s">[Callahan]</a>: I know some of our neighboring cities have, they actually have city run offices that can help local businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4536.78s">[Callahan]</a>: They have grants for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4538.24s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, both exterior and interior design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4541.481s">[Callahan]</a>: They have trainings in, you know, how to, you know, run, you know, employment, and how to run a business, all sorts of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4552.964s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that's, I heard so many times from people that we really want to be revitalizing our squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4559.625s">[Callahan]</a>: So one, it's just really a question if there is another place aside from zoning, which I know is going to be, you know, obvious, that's more obvious place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4566.647s">[Callahan]</a>: but if this seems like the right place to put some of those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4570.61s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I would love to offer that I will go ahead and make some suggestions for things we might be able to do based on what some other cities have done and ideas that came up during the campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4925.799s">[Callahan]</a>: I simply wanted to address Councilor George, I mean, Councilor Scarpelli, and say that we miss your cheerful disposition in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5004.338s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5005.158s">[Callahan]</a>: So, when I was reading this after action report, I assumed that it would include some explanation of the things that had gone wrong, and why they had gone wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5017.744s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, I just don't see anything like that in here I see a lot of things like, you know, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5024.082s">[Callahan]</a>: As Councilor Scarpelli said, we often have these results by 9pm, and yet we didn't have the results until 1 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5033.371s">[Callahan]</a>: And rather than any sort of explanation of why that happened, it says all ballots must be counted on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5039.482s">[Callahan]</a>: The tabulation facility will post the tabulated tapes in the same method as the individual precincts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5043.766s">[Callahan]</a>: Unofficial results will be released once, like there is nothing in here that explains what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5049.05s">[Callahan]</a>: So my first question is perhaps I misunderstood what this report was supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5053.895s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'd like to ask what the report was supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5057.258s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think it would be incredibly helpful to have some sort of understanding of what it was that actually went wrong because I don't see that in here at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8949.141s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8950.121s">[Callahan]</a>: It's been 24 years since a school committee has gotten a pay raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8953.343s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe that the school committee is overdue for one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8956.645s">[Callahan]</a>: We need the school committee to be paid enough to ensure that enough people run so that elections are competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8962.908s">[Callahan]</a>: We need the pay to be enough to attract people who are less wealthy, people who cannot afford to spend up to 20 hours a week doing something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8971.332s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, doesn't pay or pays very little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8974.116s">[Callahan]</a>: I see raising the school committee salary as a pro-democracy reform along with many other types of pro-democracy reforms that I will mention later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8982.626s">[Callahan]</a>: Reforms that I have presented in communities across the country for seven years that are deeply important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8989.934s">[Callahan]</a>: As I said last time, pro-democracy means not just people who are willing or dedicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8995.118s">[Callahan]</a>: It means having people sitting in those seats who represent, for example, the lower 50% of wage earners in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9001.982s">[Callahan]</a>: These are not the people who usually run for or win elected office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9006.986s">[Callahan]</a>: Pro-democracy reforms usually happen in the next cycle because it is not about paying the people currently sitting in those seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9014.41s">[Callahan]</a>: It is about getting diverse people to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9017.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Many cities and states have it in their laws that any change in salary for elected officials cannot go into effect within the same electoral cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9027.602s">[Callahan]</a>: I did not look hard for these, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9029.344s">[Callahan]</a>: So just in three minutes of Google searching, Illinois and Georgia both have state laws for all municipal elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9036.827s">[Callahan]</a>: stating that you cannot raise the pay within that electoral cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9041.71s">[Callahan]</a>: Even in Massachusetts, and again, no exhaustive search, Watertown and Everett both have city codes that say that any pay increase for school committees specifically must be voted on in the first 18 months of the cycle and cannot take effect until the next cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9060.103s">[Callahan]</a>: On the question of pay parity, I tried to find examples of pay parity between school committees and city councils discussed anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9068.993s">[Callahan]</a>: I found almost nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9071.236s">[Callahan]</a>: No well-known elected officials, no organizations that I've heard of or haven't heard of discussing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9075.982s">[Callahan]</a>: It came up for a vote in Fall River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9079.125s">[Callahan]</a>: a proposal to bring the school committee pay up to the city council pay, it did not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9083.568s">[Callahan]</a>: In Worcester, there was one school committee member who wanted for the school committee to be paid the same as city council, but that is not allowed by the city charter, which in Worcester states that the salary for members of the school committee will be equal to 50% of the salary established for members of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9101.502s">[Callahan]</a>: So unless they change the city charter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9103.427s">[Callahan]</a>: They cannot do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9105.129s">[Callahan]</a>: And I will say that across the country, school committees getting paid 50 percent of the city council is pretty standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9112.158s">[Callahan]</a>: That doesn't make it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9113.7s">[Callahan]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9114.561s">[Callahan]</a>: But it is the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9119.013s">[Callahan]</a>: I also tried to find anyone talking about this issue as one of parity between men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9124.414s">[Callahan]</a>: I could not find, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find anyone talking about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9130.996s">[Callahan]</a>: I did look up some numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9132.136s">[Callahan]</a>: So according to the National School Boards Association, 51% of school board members are men, 49% are women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9140.838s">[Callahan]</a>: We should note that this is a much higher percentage of women than in other elected bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9146.32s">[Callahan]</a>: 28% of Congress is women, 33% of state legislatures are women, 32% of city councils are women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9157.825s">[Callahan]</a>: Northampton, which is a pretty progressive city, commissioned a study on compensation for elected officials in 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9163.108s">[Callahan]</a>: That's a little while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9165.769s">[Callahan]</a>: The end result was a recommendation that they pay their city councilors $17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9169.111s">[Callahan]</a>: That was a raise for both city council and school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9172.052s">[Callahan]</a>: That they pay their school committee members $9,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9174.854s">[Callahan]</a>: They have less than half the people living in Northampton as we have in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9179.476s">[Callahan]</a>: It was 10 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9180.677s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that we should look at those specific numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9183.837s">[Callahan]</a>: But it is interesting to note that their commission did have a difference in pay between the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9190.221s">[Callahan]</a>: I am not stating that this is right, that school committees across the country are paid approximately 50%, but there appears to be nobody except for us here and in Fall River, even discussing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9212.605s">[Callahan]</a>: I believe without a doubt that a pay increase for the Medford School Committee is long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9217.546s">[Callahan]</a>: I personally believe there are many reasons why it is appropriate that pay increases for any elected officials come take effect the next cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9228.989s">[Callahan]</a>: I would like to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9230.309s">[Callahan]</a>: It's somewhat long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9231.269s">[Callahan]</a>: I can email it to the clerk, the president, the vice president, or whoever is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9238.775s">[Callahan]</a>: If it is possible to vote on it tonight, that would be great, but if not, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9244.06s">[Callahan]</a>: My motion is to send the following pro-democracy reforms to study in the Governance Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9250.565s">[Callahan]</a>: Salaries for elected officials, public financing of elections, rank choice voting for single elected offices, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, and allowing non-citizen residents to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9264.165s">[Callahan]</a>: along with that, a request that the Governance Committee prioritize the salary discussion and come to a recommendation on this issue before December 31st of 2024, so that the City Council can vote on whether to implement those salaries starting January of 2026, which is the beginning of the next electoral cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9283.861s">[Callahan]</a>: Also a request that the Governance Committee consider the following factors in their salary recommendations, in addition to any others they deem important,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9293.018s">[Callahan]</a>: getting enough people to run so that elections are competitive, enabling less wealthy people to hold elected office, and gender pay parity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10524.289s">[Callahan]</a>: Non-citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11560.202s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Kelly, are we not covering 2402?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=832.026s">[Callahan]</a>: As a new city councillor, I would love to ask how this discussion is going to proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=838.748s">[Callahan]</a>: So it sounds like my understanding was that there were going to be some proposals that would change either the number or the start date or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=847.91s">[Callahan]</a>: Are there any proposals to do that, or is this simply discussing the original?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2690.825s">[Callahan]</a>: Whew, wow, so much to say about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2699.076s">[Callahan]</a>: First, I want to say that a number of years ago, the Somerville School Committee, the paraprofessionals were asking to have their salaries raised to, I think it was $25,000 a year, which I can tell you in Somerville, nor here is a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2714.89s">[Callahan]</a>: I was outraged that the school committee was like, nope, flat out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2722.125s">[Callahan]</a>: wouldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2724.006s">[Callahan]</a>: And one of the reasons that they gave was that they were talking to other school committees and the other school committees from other cities didn't want Somerville to raise the wage because, oh no, then it would mean that they would be under pressure to raise the wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2739.393s">[Callahan]</a>: And I said right there that it was my, I was incredibly disappointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2745.635s">[Callahan]</a>: They should be proud to be the first city to do the right thing for the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.167s">[Callahan]</a>: right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.888s">[Callahan]</a>: So, and I want to start off by saying how much I believe that our paraprofessionals, especially, but also our teachers are underpaid for the work that they do, how incredibly important that work is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2770.643s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I'm boggled by the types of industries that get paid twice as much as teachers, genuinely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2778.89s">[Callahan]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2780.31s">[Callahan]</a>: That is very important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2781.751s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think, unfortunately, the only way that we are going to get the things that we care about in this city to be properly funded is to increase the total budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2791.219s">[Callahan]</a>: Because we're not going to steal from affordable housing stuff to pay the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2795.202s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not going to steal from the teachers to pay for putting us in line with our climate change goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2802.227s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not going to pay for those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2803.868s">[Callahan]</a>: We're not going to steal from one thing to pay for another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2805.79s">[Callahan]</a>: Our roads, everything is underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2809.551s">[Callahan]</a>: We are wildly underfunded in Medford and we have to solve that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2814.152s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wanna make sure that we don't come into these detailed arguments that are like, oh, well, we can't spend this $60,000 this way because it's gonna come back and fight and compete with the other 70 things that we could spend $60,000 on, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2835.039s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wanna talk a little bit about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2838.971s">[Callahan]</a>: the value of having a genuine democracy, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2843.734s">[Callahan]</a>: I truly believe, and this is something I've spent like seven years working with experts on, studying, training people around the country in how to get a better democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2853.0s">[Callahan]</a>: It's very important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2855.081s">[Callahan]</a>: I know a fair amount about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2856.642s">[Callahan]</a>: So when we talk about getting better representation or good representation on a city council or on a school committee, it is not about getting people who are dedicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2866.283s">[Callahan]</a>: It is about getting people who genuinely not only represent but vote in favor of policies that even the scales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2875.728s">[Callahan]</a>: Our government in America at all levels<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2879.955s">[Callahan]</a>: overly supports and overly serves people who are wealthy, people who own property, people who are white collar, people who have white collar jobs, people who are overly educated, people who are white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2898.742s">[Callahan]</a>: And when we talk about having a better democracy, it isn't about getting people who are dedicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2912.168s">[Callahan]</a>: New city councilor, you gotta correct me on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2921.717s">[Callahan]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2924.693s">[Callahan]</a>: So having run workshops around the country for many years and having, in these workshops, to create these workshops, I studied with experts, mostly in democracy and specifically in democracy at the local level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2938.984s">[Callahan]</a>: So city councils, town councils, more city councils than anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2943.148s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm just gonna, I pulled up here something that was from one of my workshops so that people understand that this is in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2952.535s">[Callahan]</a>: like a sphere of things you can do to structurally have a better democracy and better meaning we're not only representing home owning wealthy white people in your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2967.492s">[Callahan]</a>: that you are properly representing the people who earn less than 50% of, you know, half the people in the city earn less than 50% of the average wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2976.516s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, that's the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2979.597s">[Callahan]</a>: So things that you can do to make your city be better represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2985.639s">[Callahan]</a>: are public financing of elections, having district awards, making sure you have vote-by-mail or early voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2990.54s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not going to read all of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2991.381s">[Callahan]</a>: There's like two dozen of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2993.721s">[Callahan]</a>: Are your elections on paper ballots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2995.202s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there a hand-counted audit of at least 1%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2997.522s">[Callahan]</a>: And are your elected officials paid a living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3000.363s">[Callahan]</a>: So the problem with this idea that it should be a volunteer effort is that there are lots of people, mostly people who earn less than 50%, less than the average wage in your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3014.875s">[Callahan]</a>: that they just can't volunteer 20 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3018.757s">[Callahan]</a>: Neither they nor their spouse earns enough money that they are able to spend time with their families and live a decent life and pay their bills, their rent, or their groceries, or whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3032.686s">[Callahan]</a>: It's not about them not being dedicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3041.513s">[Callahan]</a>: do the job if it doesn't pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3044.395s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm going to say, I don't think any of us on the city council, and I don't want to speak for other people, but in most cities, no one on the city council and no one on the school committee falls into those categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3059.564s">[Callahan]</a>: And that's why these people are underrepresented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3061.745s">[Callahan]</a>: So I care a lot about democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3063.867s">[Callahan]</a>: And I genuinely believe that the right thing to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3067.905s">[Callahan]</a>: is to increase the pay of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3071.266s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, that doesn't mean, that being said, right, I also believe that as a city, as an elected city councilor, it is my style to make a bunch of, to be able to pass a lot of things that materially help people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3090.612s">[Callahan]</a>: Fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3093.748s">[Callahan]</a>: make sure all of our positions in the school are properly, that we have people who are second language teachers, that we have after school programs for everyone, that we have these things before we do anything that is either for ourselves or cultural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3111.747s">[Callahan]</a>: That is my style.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3113.369s">[Callahan]</a>: So I feel incredibly uncomfortable voting on this as the very first thing that comes up in my term as a city councilor, because that is not the way that I want to serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3125.78s">[Callahan]</a>: That is not the way that I want to serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3129.103s">[Callahan]</a>: But I want people to understand that my viewpoint on this is not something that I come to in the last month because this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3137.196s">[Callahan]</a>: particular issue came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3139.078s">[Callahan]</a>: This is a viewpoint that I have held for many years, having worked with many experts on how to get your city to properly serve the underserved, which includes the paraprofessionals and the teachers and the other union workers who work here for the city or in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3157.759s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are incredibly important to me, and it's important to me that we serve those people first before we serve ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3163.622s">[Callahan]</a>: But it is important because the only way you can sustain a city council or a school committee that makes those right decisions is by paying a little bit more so that we can have people on those bodies who come from those backgrounds and not just people who want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3186.57s">[Callahan]</a>: to hope to serve those people, but never actually talk to them because we all live in our own bubbles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3191.432s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3545.302s">[Callahan]</a>: I was only going to ask for the motions to be read more slowly before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3754.139s">[Callahan]</a>: Can you clarify the dollar amounts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8339.947s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm a little bothered by the fact that it looks like in both of these proposals, the final landing pay is more than the lowest paid paraprofessional that I don't feel, unless I'm incorrect about that, that's what it looked like to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8355.319s">[Callahan]</a>: I won't be voting in favor of anything that puts them above a full-time paraprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8492.16s">[Callahan]</a>: This is to put this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8502.288s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8745.976s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8749.828s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8749.928s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=87.695s">[Callahan]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=87.835s">[Callahan]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=615.714s">[Callahan]</a>: I second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=937.117s">[Callahan]</a>: Lawrence Lepore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2121.533s">[Callahan]</a>: I approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2122.193s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2125.314s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3131.142s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3131.642s">[Callahan]</a>: I first wanted to really thank President Bears for all the work that went into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3137.544s">[Callahan]</a>: It looks like a really excellent framework that we'll all be able to add to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3141.285s">[Callahan]</a>: And I especially wanted to highlight how, like, I think a lot about democracy, and to me, that's engaging people in the political process, and also just engaging people in their own ideas for making Medford better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3152.849s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that this document, in terms of the transparency that Councilor Scarpelli mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3157.47s">[Callahan]</a>: It really allows us because especially with the timelines it allows us to communicate with our residents and to engage them in the process right and I understand that this is not in any way finalized but for example, someone who is really concerned about any of those housing home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3174.419s">[Callahan]</a>: that I think a lot of folks in Medford are either for or against, that being able to sort of point out what timeline we think that's going to happen on and when they can get engaged, that is crucial in terms of getting people to engage in the process politically, which I'm very excited about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3192.771s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much, President Bears, and thanks to everyone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3195.933s">[Callahan]</a>: I really look forward to seeing what everyone adds to this framework so that it can truly become a document that we can share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3203.365s">[Callahan]</a>: with the public as the plan that we see as our ability to engage the public in what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4758.871s">[Callahan]</a>: Hi, yep, I very much agree that this is important, and we need to protect those residents health and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4767.294s">[Callahan]</a>: I would love to hear from President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4769.595s">[Callahan]</a>: If you happen to know any sort of just a tiny bit of details about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4774.337s">[Callahan]</a>: Obviously, if this is under state regulations and other cities are passing this, there's going to be, you know, places that the Board of Health will go for the kinds of details about how this might affect, like, small local landlords and the ways in which the sort of, you know, is there funding that is available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4795.889s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there, you know, how is this sort of effectively done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4800.091s">[Callahan]</a>: I have not looked into how that is done at the state level or at other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4804.234s">[Callahan]</a>: if there's a word or two you could speak to on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5491.476s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5492.937s">[Callahan]</a>: I read this section of the state code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5495.538s">[Callahan]</a>: I was very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5496.838s">[Callahan]</a>: It's something I talked about on the campaign trail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5499.84s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, this is something that really just gets right at affordable housing in terms of rentals, and it attacks the problem exactly where it exists, by rewarding those rental properties and those landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5513.902s">[Callahan]</a>: who are renting below market rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5516.343s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is exactly what we want to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5518.685s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm pretty excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5521.086s">[Callahan]</a>: I also am excited about the fact that it will just by the fact of doing this, you know, most of the people, the landlords who are renting below market rates tend to be local.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5532.252s">[Callahan]</a>: Many of them live here in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5534.775s">[Callahan]</a>: If not right here in our city, then they're in nearby cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5537.777s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think being able to target these tax credits for folks who live here is what I wish we could do if we can legally, if we can find a way to do it legally for Medford residents, I would love to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5546.845s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm also very happy that this will target people who are local, a lot of Medford resident landlords, as well as folks who live in nearby cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5555.073s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5556.094s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm excited to discuss it on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5557.835s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6145.864s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6146.364s">[Callahan]</a>: So where can we, whether we are city councilors or members of the interested public, where can we find the Wellington Circle Study?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7998.858s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8000.814s">[Callahan]</a>: Mr. Brown, I want to commend you for being a model resident of Medford because I am so impressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8006.696s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, I'm pained to hear that you have been trying to get this done for 10 years, but I am so impressed that you, you know, you're not just complaining about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8016.32s">[Callahan]</a>: You are talking deeply about the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8018.841s">[Callahan]</a>: You have looked into how it could be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8020.562s">[Callahan]</a>: You have looked into the proper surface that needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8022.844s">[Callahan]</a>: You have looked into what other cities have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8024.725s">[Callahan]</a>: You have truly looked at what the solutions should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8029.227s">[Callahan]</a>: And I am also very happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8031.668s">[Callahan]</a>: So I will, you know, in conjunction with Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Mulroney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8039.193s">[Callahan]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8039.793s">[Callahan]</a>: Like, I'm happy to help in any way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8042.134s">[Callahan]</a>: And I do, I know this is not a simple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8045.894s">[Callahan]</a>: issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8046.594s">[Callahan]</a>: But I do hope that Medford can become a city that can respond to people like you, to people who come to us with well-thought-out proposals that they have already dug into the solutions for and already done a lot of that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8061.523s">[Callahan]</a>: Because the point that that has happened, we really need to be able to say yes to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8066.446s">[Callahan]</a>: That is how we engage people in the political process when someone, I mean it's a miracle that you're still here 10 years later, because normally when people come and they propose these well thought out solutions, and they're told no or they simply get nothing, they will go away they never come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8085.532s">[Callahan]</a>: the best thing our city can do to take these amazing solutions that are provided by people who genuinely care about a specific issue and to find ways to incorporate those into a solution that we can make happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8099.103s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm really hoping that we can do it, not just for your issue, but more broadly for folks in Medford who want to engage in the political process in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8106.428s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8380.691s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8385.152s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4696.567s">[Callahan]</a>: So, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5017.305s">[Callahan]</a>: Take a photo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5068.049s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5068.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7492.02s">[Callahan]</a>: miss.<br><br>
