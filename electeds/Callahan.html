    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6428.629s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6429.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor, for being here, for all the work that you have done on the budget and providing us with the information early, and also on working on these proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6441.02s">[Callahan]</a>: People who know me will know that I believe two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6445.344s">[Callahan]</a>: One, I believe in democracy, and two, that I believe that this city has been underfunded for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6452.671s">[Callahan]</a>: So...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6456.585s">[Callahan]</a>: to the first point, again, as councilor tang mentioned, we are not voting to approve of these monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6464.594s">[Callahan]</a>: We are voting to allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6467.13s">[Callahan]</a>: the people of Medford to make this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6470.592s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6473.094s">[Callahan]</a>: To me, that is the most important thing, is that we not, the only thing that we could do now, tonight, that would be the most undemocratic thing to do, would be for us to refuse to allow the voters to make this decision, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6490.145s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be undemocratic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6492.086s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's my first point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6499.835s">[Callahan]</a>: My second point is about the chronic underfunding of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6504.619s">[Callahan]</a>: And while I certainly am all for new growth, I think it simply doesn't add up if you look at the reality of the funding of the city and at what we need in order to not be financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6522.523s">[Callahan]</a>: The problem is that costs rise faster than Prop 2.5 allows us to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6530.205s">[Callahan]</a>: And if we simply look at the budget, we can see that in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6533.426s">[Callahan]</a>: So the largest portion of the budget is our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6537.267s">[Callahan]</a>: The second largest portion of the budget is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6539.847s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6541.548s">[Callahan]</a>: We do not have any control over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6543.468s">[Callahan]</a>: It is going up higher than we are allowed to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6546.249s">[Callahan]</a>: The third one is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6549.191s">[Callahan]</a>: Pensions we also do not control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6550.872s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are the top three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6552.554s">[Callahan]</a>: After that come police and fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6555.516s">[Callahan]</a>: And the fourth one after that is roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6559.278s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to talk about roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6561.36s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want people to understand that these costs, many of them are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6565.603s">[Callahan]</a>: They are uncontrollable by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6568.705s">[Callahan]</a>: And they're going up faster than we are allowed to raise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6572.608s">[Callahan]</a>: So this simply is something that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6576.331s">[Callahan]</a>: It's math, you cannot make those numbers match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6580.795s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to talk about roads because we had a great meeting with the Commissioner, the DPW and one of the engineers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6589.123s">[Callahan]</a>: There was a roads assessment done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6590.605s">[Callahan]</a>: If people have not looked at that roads assessment done in 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6595.129s">[Callahan]</a>: It basically said that, so the grade roads, they call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6599.531s">[Callahan]</a>: I like to call them A, B, C, D, and F, because everybody understands grades that we get in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6606.655s">[Callahan]</a>: 49% of our roads in 2021 were rated D or F, the worst two possible qualities of roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6615.64s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, it costs 50 times as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6618.962s">[Callahan]</a>: to bring a road from F to A as it costs to bring a road from B to A. So the problem is if you are simply not spending enough on your roads every single year that you're allowing roads to get to be D and F, that is unbelievably financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6637.057s">[Callahan]</a>: because the amount of money it takes to then repair those roads is like 30 to 50 times more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6643.682s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is years of underfunding our roads that has led us to this place and it is financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6657.192s">[Callahan]</a>: We came out of COVID and during COVID, students everywhere suffered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6665.063s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered mental health issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6666.924s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered academic issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6668.905s">[Callahan]</a>: They suffered from family issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6672.066s">[Callahan]</a>: And this is a reality that our students, all of our students in our schools are facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6676.728s">[Callahan]</a>: They need more supports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6679.649s">[Callahan]</a>: That is just a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6683.231s">[Callahan]</a>: And the other thing about schools is that we have school buildings that have not been properly maintained, that the money to properly maintain them has not been spent in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6694.796s">[Callahan]</a>: That means that we are in debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6696.217s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are in road debt, we are in school debt, we are in school support debt, we are in trees debt, and I'm glad we planted 200 trees, but it is my understanding, and this is colloquially that I have heard through the grapevine, we do not have actual study yet, it's not completed, but my understanding is we lose more than twice as many trees every year as we plant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6715.885s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are in tree debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6718.186s">[Callahan]</a>: We are in debt in terms of the salaries because we do not, our salaries are not commensurate with other cities, surrounding cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6726.848s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that means is that it is incredibly difficult now for us to fill positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6734.31s">[Callahan]</a>: We have turnover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6736.25s">[Callahan]</a>: This is financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6740.27s">[Callahan]</a>: So the problem is not, like the problem that we have, new growth, there is no city in the world that could create the new growth needed to fill these gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6752.118s">[Callahan]</a>: These gaps are real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6755.821s">[Callahan]</a>: They are due to many things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6759.143s">[Callahan]</a>: And I believe that the proper thing to do is to allow our community to make the decision through democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.11s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8952.43s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to mention one thing for folks concerned about seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8956.133s">[Callahan]</a>: We also have in Medford, there is something that people can request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8960.275s">[Callahan]</a>: If you're a senior, you can request that you can be exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8963.718s">[Callahan]</a>: In fact, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, from all of your, up to all of your taxes, and that can be until your property is sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8971.123s">[Callahan]</a>: So that is something that seniors in Medford have the option of doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8975.185s">[Callahan]</a>: So we hope that this Prop 2.5 override will not negatively impact folks in their day-to-day living expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14963.578s">[Callahan]</a>: I guess my only, not knowing very much about this, my only comment is that I will admit I do not quite understand what this actually does and if it restricts the ability for people to speak in a certain way or, like, I'm just trying to understand what this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14979.978s">[Callahan]</a>: actually changes material for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16680.636s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=42.412s">[Callahan]</a>: You can borrow mine in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=112.294s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=113.174s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=114.374s">[Callahan]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=118.495s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lozaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=120.696s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=121.436s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=122.357s">[Callahan]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=123.077s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=126.298s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Sanz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1161.301s">[Callahan]</a>: That would be miraculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1162.622s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2634.712s">[Callahan]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2635.452s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2638.494s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2639.956s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2686.928s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2722.832s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2727.656s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2730.558s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2730.978s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2732.78s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2668.185s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2669.727s">[Callahan]</a>: So, I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2674.631s">[Callahan]</a>: And as Councilor Lemming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2685.001s">[Callahan]</a>: in the amount of budget we have per person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2687.623s">[Callahan]</a>: So we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2695.39s">[Callahan]</a>: All of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2700.154s">[Callahan]</a>: Our budget is too small to provide the services that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2704.477s">[Callahan]</a>: I want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2710.661s">[Callahan]</a>: And this large blue area here is the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2715.664s">[Callahan]</a>: That is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2719.987s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2723.369s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is something that we are required to have by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2726.791s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot cut that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2728.132s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2730.155s">[Callahan]</a>: Those are contractual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2731.737s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot cut pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2733.74s">[Callahan]</a>: The next two are our fire department and our police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2737.845s">[Callahan]</a>: My feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2746.016s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one after police and fire is our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2749.461s">[Callahan]</a>: And I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt it's called the road backlog 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2761.857s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2763.338s">[Callahan]</a>: After that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2774.121s">[Callahan]</a>: None of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2782.624s">[Callahan]</a>: Our budget is simply too small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2784.225s">[Callahan]</a>: I'll let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2786.985s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3665.382s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3666.483s">[Callahan]</a>: I hear a lot of people asking about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3669.484s">[Callahan]</a>: I think misunderstanding what free cash is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3672.005s">[Callahan]</a>: First thing I'd like to say is, free cash, dumb name, it's not free, it's not cash, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3675.947s">[Callahan]</a>: So, free cash, sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3680.349s">[Callahan]</a>: Free, free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3693.575s">[Callahan]</a>: May I get my two minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3696.401s">[Callahan]</a>: Will I get my two minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3699.043s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3700.763s">[Callahan]</a>: Free cash is the term that the state uses for the money that is left over after your budget season has ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3709.968s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's the difference between what you budget, which, let's say, is $180 million, and the amount you spent, which, let's say, is $172 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3714.69s">[Callahan]</a>: That $8 million, which is the difference, is called free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3722.313s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, the state of Massachusetts has a group called the Division of Local Services, and their job is to help cities and towns become financially responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3732.523s">[Callahan]</a>: They highly recommend that cities and towns in Massachusetts have 3 to 5% of their budget left over in free cash every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3742.867s">[Callahan]</a>: In Medford, that amount would be between $5 million and $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3747.329s">[Callahan]</a>: If you don't have between 3 and 5% of your budget left over in free cash, you are considered financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3753.932s">[Callahan]</a>: by credit agencies and your bond rating goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3757.514s">[Callahan]</a>: Now that is very bad because it changes, just like if your credit rating is bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3761.715s">[Callahan]</a>: It changes the amount that you have to spend anytime you borrow money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3765.397s">[Callahan]</a>: So we want to be a financially responsible city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3768.698s">[Callahan]</a>: So having money left over in free cash, and I'm going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3773.02s">[Callahan]</a>: I have another chart here because I think it's important for people to understand that this city was in the past very financially irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3782.868s">[Callahan]</a>: If you notice that before 2012, we couldn't even meet our budget many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3788.472s">[Callahan]</a>: We definitely never reached that 3% in free cash and our bond rating was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3794.697s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's only in recent years that we have begun to have anywhere close to the required 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3801.162s">[Callahan]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3802.342s">[Callahan]</a>: Now free cash according to the state of Massachusetts should never be used for an operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3808.284s">[Callahan]</a>: It needs to be used for capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3810.444s">[Callahan]</a>: We currently because of underfunding of our roads have $67 million in road debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3815.586s">[Callahan]</a>: We have $79 million in our capital improvement plan for things that need to be done only in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3821.274s">[Callahan]</a>: Three to five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3822.995s">[Callahan]</a>: So we cannot use free cash for something like our school budget that is absolutely verboten according to financially responsible people in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4994.605s">[Callahan]</a>: two minutes councilor calvin and then councilor collins very quickly the reason that those other cities don't have as much money in free cash is because they weren't last to the table in getting a stabilization fund having a stabilization fund again is considered financially responsible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5010.774s">[Callahan]</a>: Medford didn't have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5012.755s">[Callahan]</a>: There are 451 cities and towns in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5016.896s">[Callahan]</a>: We are one of the last five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5019.317s">[Callahan]</a>: Only five remained this year that did not have a stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5023.038s">[Callahan]</a>: That's why we have all this free cash, because we didn't have any stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6437.822s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much for your correction, because I do know it's 351.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6441.105s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm surprised that I said that, but thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6643.482s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to speak to the question, which is, where is the money going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6648.825s">[Callahan]</a>: So my understanding is that in that first year is when that strong encouragement to spend it on what was mentioned in the- It's a legal requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6657.368s">[Callahan]</a>: A legal requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6658.209s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6659.069s">[Callahan]</a>: A legal requirement to spend it on what was talked about in the ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6663.451s">[Callahan]</a>: But what happens over time, because Prop 2.5 overrides<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6670.282s">[Callahan]</a>: don't end, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6671.082s">[Callahan]</a>: They sort of just mean that the total amount of the budget is increased and that will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6679.567s">[Callahan]</a>: It is a sustainable source of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6681.688s">[Callahan]</a>: And what that means is that over time, there may be, you know, like 10 years later, 15, 20, 30 years later, it may be that that budget needs, you know, the city council should be able to spend that budget in the way that makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6696.655s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6699.036s">[Callahan]</a>: It's a legal requirement at the beginning, but it does go into the general fund, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8276.116s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure, I think it's important to understand that the money from both seven and eight will go to the schools, obviously not the 500,000 for the roads, but the rest of it, and that it is the job of the school committee with the mayor and with the school superintendent and the financial people and the whole administration of the schools to figure out how best to serve children with that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8305.484s">[Callahan]</a>: It's possible that a tiny percentage of that may be necessary to boost our busing so that young kids are not walking across dangerous intersections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8318.456s">[Callahan]</a>: And I'm not going to be making that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8321.059s">[Callahan]</a>: That's simply a tiny example since people have mentioned busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8327.725s">[Callahan]</a>: a zillion different decisions that can be made when you're talking about the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8333.008s">[Callahan]</a>: And it's the job of that part of the electeds and administration, the school committee, as well as the administration of the school system to make the best decisions each year, given what is happening that year with the budget that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8349.859s">[Callahan]</a>: And of course, as always, with the best interests of the students in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8992.506s">[Callahan]</a>: That's a tough question to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8994.047s">[Callahan]</a>: I simply want to say that chronic underfunding, unfortunately, causes people to mistrust their government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9002.709s">[Callahan]</a>: So, you know, half of our roads are in the worst two road conditions, and that's from chronic underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9011.692s">[Callahan]</a>: It costs between 30 and 50 times as much to fix a road in condition five, that's the worst one, as it does to fix a road in condition two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9022.864s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, we would be able to pay every year for all of our roads to get repaired with chapter 90 funding if we never let them fall into that kind of disrepair, but through underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9035.97s">[Callahan]</a>: chronic decades long underfunding, we have created a city that cannot service basic, basic needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9043.576s">[Callahan]</a>: And that does make people mistrust the government, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9046.918s">[Callahan]</a>: But the fix is, and someone here mentioned, you know, that what other communities do when they're in these situations is bonds and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9056.905s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that what other communities do in this situation is they pass a prop two and a half override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10290.473s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10291.554s">[Callahan]</a>: Always good to see young folks coming up here and asking these great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10297.496s">[Callahan]</a>: So I just want to talk a little bit about the difference between 7 and 8, Proposition 7, Proposition 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10306.04s">[Callahan]</a>: And 7 is going to make sure that we provide the same resources and the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10312.486s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, budget, basically, that we have been providing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10317.33s">[Callahan]</a>: Prop eight is gonna be where we make sure that we can actually really do a little bit more, that we can take care of our teachers, that we can pay them better salaries, that we can pay paras better salaries, that we take care of them the way that they are taking care of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10336.086s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's just a little bit about the difference between those two and why they're separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10343.295s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.268s">[Callahan]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10857.768s">[Callahan]</a>: And again, these questions are better answered by school committee folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10861.129s">[Callahan]</a>: My understanding is that you can't really compare what our entire school budget is to other cities very well, because other cities don't include a lot of the things that we include in the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10872.911s">[Callahan]</a>: So it's not apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10874.991s">[Callahan]</a>: And I wish I could rattle off all the things that are included and not included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10878.792s">[Callahan]</a>: The ones that I recall are, I think, IT, and now because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10883.661s">[Callahan]</a>: post COVID, there's just a lot more, you know, Chromebooks required for students and other IT related things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10890.563s">[Callahan]</a>: IT is often not included in school budgets in other cities, but it is included in our school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10895.544s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are parts of building maintenance that are included in our school budget that are not included in other city school budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10901.326s">[Callahan]</a>: So while it appears, if you just look at the number, it appears that we spend more per student,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10909.005s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't believe that that is an accurate way of looking at it simply because of the things that are and aren't included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10914.67s">[Callahan]</a>: And then I just wanted to comment about the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10918.253s">[Callahan]</a>: Unless I'm mistaken, please correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10921.216s">[Callahan]</a>: We have one of the shortest school days of anywhere in the entire state that we are barely like a minute or two above the state absolute minimum for the number of minutes that children have to spend in school across the entire year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12169.994s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a super quick comment that teachers who are underpaid compared to how much they could make in other cities, they do think about whether the city is able to fund them the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12182.738s">[Callahan]</a>: So if we want people to stay, it's just healthier for us in terms of teacher morale and longevity to have, for them to know that the budget is there for their salaries for the next year, because people do try to think ahead<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12200.057s">[Callahan]</a>: you know, they're less, we'll just have more turnover, that's all, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12841.913s">[Callahan]</a>: If I can, oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12843.054s">[Callahan]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12846.367s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I just um, so my understanding is that there are some numbers going around comparing Medford salaries with communities like Arlington, but actually just have an accurate numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12858.497s">[Callahan]</a>: And, and those are all public so you can actually go on the web and like look up those numbers so I encourage you to do that just to make sure that the numbers that you're seeing are accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12865.783s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.305s">[Callahan]</a>: I love that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13928.966s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you so much for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13931.529s">[Callahan]</a>: I think there are a few basic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13935.354s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't want to say rules of engagement, but just pieces of advice that people hopefully understand as like good for group dynamics healthy for a community healthy for a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13947.177s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that people in their conversations with neighbors can think about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13951.123s">[Callahan]</a>: I hope that we on the council can also do these things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13954.247s">[Callahan]</a>: They are things like treat other people with respect and dignity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13960.815s">[Callahan]</a>: Assume good intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13963.431s">[Callahan]</a>: Don't assume that the other person means you ill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13967.312s">[Callahan]</a>: Just assume that they have good intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13969.992s">[Callahan]</a>: Listen to what folks are actually saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13974.953s">[Callahan]</a>: Don't use accusational language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13978.754s">[Callahan]</a>: Basic decorum, basic showing respect for other people is what I encourage for everyone in all of their discussions with the friends, family, neighbors, city councilors, and all of those folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13991.801s">[Callahan]</a>: And I hope that if I am not following that, people will call me out, because I do hope that I can always treat everyone, no matter what their political position on a topic is, with respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14007.644s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=775.169s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, I also did not know him nearly as well as I wish I had, but I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=785.444s">[Callahan]</a>: we will really never be able to replace him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=788.985s">[Callahan]</a>: No matter who we get for this position, we won't be able to replace him because of his personality and because of who he was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=797.767s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm, you know, someday we'll have someone in that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=800.108s">[Callahan]</a>: They'll be different, but Larry is definitely truly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1266.807s">[Callahan]</a>: Just clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1267.448s">[Callahan]</a>: So it sounds like this is to ensure that we are in line with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1273.614s">[Callahan]</a>: So state law already has changed, and we want to have something explicitly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1278.177s">[Callahan]</a>: supporting the state law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1298.213s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1591.998s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1592.439s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think in addition to the cost, which is important, I would love to have, you know, either if you have already done some of this research, possibly we do more research into the need in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1606.693s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, I'm sure you've already thought of this, but we may want to reach out to the Disabilities Commission, we may want to see if we can reach out to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1615.888s">[Callahan]</a>: Mothers with newborns and small babies because I just remember from that time period that like finding a bathroom that had a changing space was like absolutely crucial and if I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1626.175s">[Callahan]</a>: couldn't find one, it's like very bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1628.256s">[Callahan]</a>: And maybe we can think of other, you know, groups of people that might have special needs or not even that special, but like, you know, some understanding of what the need is in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1643.225s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think that would also help us sort of make the case for the cost of these going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1649.389s">[Callahan]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=374.985s">[Callahan]</a>: In the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=375.766s">[Callahan]</a>: Uh huh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=377.627s">[Callahan]</a>: Oh, that's looking good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=378.968s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=380.629s">[Callahan]</a>: Tasty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=382.17s">[Callahan]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=383.811s">[Callahan]</a>: Just there's a typo at the end of the first general business point and invest $4 million to invest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=943.587s">[Callahan]</a>: I've looked through everything and it looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=945.767s">[Callahan]</a>: I know that Councillor Sang is updating just the governance committee one, but I think my committee is good and the rest of it looks good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=953.45s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much for putting it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1179.341s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, just, didn't we also have that commemoration of Larry Lepore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1184.966s">[Callahan]</a>: But I'm wondering, do we, in the past, we've left those off of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1190.97s">[Callahan]</a>: I think that is accurate that we have not put in like the personal ones about, you know, I started so I started I started doing that because I figured it was it was nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1225.856s">[Callahan]</a>: We'll want to put Larry Lepore in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1228.458s">[Callahan]</a>: Larry Lepore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1351.668s">[Callahan]</a>: And I actually do have one like to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1354.289s">[Callahan]</a>: This seems grammatically awkward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1356.49s">[Callahan]</a>: This section that I like we started discussions on the city charter review process, including setting a timeline as we expect the Charter Review Committee's recommendations to like to me there has to be an ending to that sentence, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1380.626s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not sure what you mean as we expect them to continue to arrive or as we expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1401.18s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1447.461s">[Callahan]</a>: I move to approve and send to, just to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1474.388s">[Callahan]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1493.075s">[Callahan]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=422.754s">[Callahan]</a>: I only just noticed that we are a new blonde chicks panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=428.501s">[Callahan]</a>: So I wanted to talk for a good picture because a lot of people are asking why do we have to increase hope?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=435.27s">[Callahan]</a>: Why are we trying to increase sexism?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=439.495s">[Callahan]</a>: And so the basic question is really, do we have enough money to do the services in our city that we want, that we really are expecting from anyone that lives in any city in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=452.904s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'll start by saying that we rank 320th out of 351 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=457.307s">[Callahan]</a>: That's the 2024 budget, in terms of our budget per capita.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=466.313s">[Callahan]</a>: So that means we have a smaller budget per person than all of the other 58 cities, and it is smaller per person than 90% of towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=477.345s">[Callahan]</a>: The only towns that have a smaller budget per person than we do are all much smaller than New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=483.912s">[Callahan]</a>: So the truth is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=486.195s">[Callahan]</a>: We just can't run a city on the amount of money that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=490.617s">[Callahan]</a>: And Prop 2.5, I don't know how much we're, we need to get into that specifically, but Prop 2.5 in Massachusetts means that if we're gonna raise taxes more than the total amount of taxes that we bring into the city, more than 2.5% per year, we put that on the ballot and ask the voters to make that decision, and that's what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=511.288s">[Callahan]</a>: The other thing I want to raise now, because people ask this question a lot,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=516.19s">[Callahan]</a>: Is there somewhere in our budget that we can scrimp and save?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=523.852s">[Callahan]</a>: This giant blue piece of the pie is our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=528.473s">[Callahan]</a>: I think everyone on both sides of this question understands that we have a huge funding gap in our schools and that we need to find more funding for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=537.315s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=538.896s">[Callahan]</a>: Insurance is required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=541.28s">[Callahan]</a>: We cannot, this is not discretionary, we can't cut that budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=545.283s">[Callahan]</a>: The next budget is pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=547.225s">[Callahan]</a>: Pensions, again, are a contract, but we cannot just decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=553.312s">[Callahan]</a>: The next two are fire and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=557.114s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't think that anyone on either side of this fractured and wrapped question wants us to drastically cut our fire department or our police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=566.158s">[Callahan]</a>: The next one is DPW highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=569.22s">[Callahan]</a>: That means our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=572.574s">[Callahan]</a>: And the thing that's important to understand about roads is that the more you underfund them, the more money, you're ballooning the amount of debt that you have to pay later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=584.023s">[Callahan]</a>: So, for example, we had a road assessment done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=586.965s">[Callahan]</a>: It has five ratings, one, two, three, four, five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=590.805s">[Callahan]</a>: 49% of our roads fall into the worst two categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=594.587s">[Callahan]</a>: And here's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=595.968s">[Callahan]</a>: It costs at least 30 times as much to fix a category five road as it costs to fix a category two road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=603.632s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you just always fix your category two roads, and always have your roads in good condition, you can actually do it with the state funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=611.797s">[Callahan]</a>: But when you allow them, when you underfund them, and you allow them to get in such a dilapidated state, you just haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=618.14s">[Callahan]</a>: In prior administrations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=620.117s">[Callahan]</a>: You're ballooning the amount of debt that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=623.118s">[Callahan]</a>: So you can't underfront your roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=625.279s">[Callahan]</a>: After roads is bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=628.82s">[Callahan]</a>: Again, we have to pay that money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=631.601s">[Callahan]</a>: This is not something that we can just decide not to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=635.262s">[Callahan]</a>: And now we're getting into these tiny, we're not working up here in these teeny, weeny little ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=641.244s">[Callahan]</a>: With the library, facilities, and other small departments like HR, things we simply cannot cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=648.396s">[Callahan]</a>: There is nowhere in this budget that there's a ton of waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=653.959s">[Callahan]</a>: There's nowhere in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=655.4s">[Callahan]</a>: We already have, over decades, cut and cut and cut and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=661.303s">[Callahan]</a>: There's nowhere else to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=662.764s">[Callahan]</a>: We simply do not have the budget to support a city of our size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=667.406s">[Callahan]</a>: And I would like to pass it to Mayor, if I remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=669.547s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1213.174s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, I think I'm going to take what is free cash, and then the mayor is going to take what are the projects that are waiting in ways for free cash to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1222.384s">[Callahan]</a>: So, free cash, dumb name, not free, not cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1226.328s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1229.249s">[Callahan]</a>: So pre-cash is the official term for, at the end of budget season, let's say your budget was $108 million, and at the end of the budget, you spend $107 million, that $10 million difference, it's called pre-cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1244.638s">[Callahan]</a>: Now maybe you had a little more revenue than you expected, maybe you didn't spend on something you thought you would spend on, but it's very common, and what's important to understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1255.709s">[Callahan]</a>: is that it is recommended by the state of Massachusetts that cities and towns have between 3% and 5% of their budget in free cash each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1266.978s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, 3% to 5% of the federal budget is between $5 million and $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1271.381s">[Callahan]</a>: And the reason it's recommended is because bond agencies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1277.563s">[Callahan]</a>: will give you a rating based in part, so that's one of the things they use to give you a bond rating, which is like a credit rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1284.686s">[Callahan]</a>: So if you don't have free cash, if you end up spending every penny, which I have heard from people like, we should spend every penny, it's mismanaged, we don't spend every penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1295.331s">[Callahan]</a>: It's actually financially mismanaged according to bond agencies and according to the state of Massachusetts if you spend every penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1302.615s">[Callahan]</a>: It is considered that you are not being financially responsible with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1307.264s">[Callahan]</a>: So that's the most important thing to understand is that we need to have free cash in order to have a good profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1314.347s">[Callahan]</a>: And what else can I say about free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1316.588s">[Callahan]</a>: Maybe the next thing is just to talk about what it gets used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1320.71s">[Callahan]</a>: The one other thing I will say is that in 2024, we, for the first time, created a capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1330.534s">[Callahan]</a>: Now, we were one of the last five municipalities out of 351, sorry, 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1337.675s">[Callahan]</a>: We were one of the last five to create one, so we finally did that, and that's where you're supposed to put pre-cash so that it can be spent on capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1805.573s">[Callahan]</a>: And just quickly, the city council has been working on rezoning, and we're pretty excited about this to ask, because we're gonna rezone for a lot of mixed use and a lot higher stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1817.843s">[Callahan]</a>: It'll gradually, as it goes away from the metro squares, it'll gradually get more and more stories, but we're very excited about the amount of people who might have their, and I will also just, I will switch over to Ross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1828.772s">[Callahan]</a>: So this is our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1831.674s">[Callahan]</a>: This is the commercial sector, new growth, and I don't know how much you can see, but the last two years have been higher new growth than any time in the last 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1841.243s">[Callahan]</a>: So we really are doing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1889.87s">[Callahan]</a>: Okay, we haven't actually explained Prop 2.5 fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1893.051s">[Callahan]</a>: Would you like to start by explaining Prop 2.5?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1897.151s">[Callahan]</a>: Let me just do Prop 2.5 and override versus a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1901.972s">[Callahan]</a>: So, unlike almost every other state in the country,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1905.765s">[Callahan]</a>: where city councils are allowed to raise the taxes that they determine that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1910.388s">[Callahan]</a>: They're elected, they run on it, they either want to raise taxes or they want to not raise taxes, and then as elected officials, they make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1918.733s">[Callahan]</a>: In Massachusetts, a statewide ballot measure passed in 1980 that said that no city or town can raise the total tax levy, total amount of money brought into the city, more than 2.5% per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1934.914s">[Callahan]</a>: New growth changes the model, that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1938.395s">[Callahan]</a>: But the point is not that they can't raise the taxes, it's simply that to raise those taxes, they put it on the ballot and they allow the voters to make that decision for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1949.52s">[Callahan]</a>: Even the proponents of Prop 10.5 did not want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1953.101s">[Callahan]</a>: So it used to go 30 years without ever 40 years without ever putting it on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1957.523s">[Callahan]</a>: They believed that it should be put on the ballot and the voters should decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1961.873s">[Callahan]</a>: Override is something that you increase the total amount that the tax levy can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1971.156s">[Callahan]</a>: So in our case, it would be $3.5 million for question 7, $4 million more for question 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1980.238s">[Callahan]</a>: And at that point, that becomes a new tax levy, and that can be increased 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1988.712s">[Callahan]</a>: because it has a limited, it can only be used for the thing, well, they can both only be used for what they're supposed to be for, but it's for capital projects, and once it is paid off, that tax then goes down again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2005.014s">[Callahan]</a>: That's pretty much it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2599.155s">[Callahan]</a>: The only thing I have to add is once you negotiate contracts with the teachers, then you have a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2615.09s">[Callahan]</a>: I don't see how that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2617.592s">[Callahan]</a>: And how often have we cut the school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4902.902s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to say one very quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4905.423s">[Callahan]</a>: Every year, for the last 40 years, that we have not put this on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4910.684s">[Callahan]</a>: We have not allowed our community to make these decisions for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3227.381s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3229.283s">[Callahan]</a>: So I did have a very quick question, a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3231.807s">[Callahan]</a>: First of all, I'm extremely impressed with certainly everything that I had suggested language on or had advocated for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3239.497s">[Callahan]</a>: Everything has gotten in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3241.019s">[Callahan]</a>: Definitions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3242.1s">[Callahan]</a>: Like everything looks wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3243.902s">[Callahan]</a>: So thank you so much for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3246.205s">[Callahan]</a>: making sure that all of these different pieces from the different counselors made it in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3250.848s">[Callahan]</a>: And my only question looking at this whole thing is really about the environmental resilience piece and the table of development incentive bonuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3260.675s">[Callahan]</a>: And I know we have had a tiny bit of discussion about green score, and here it is, just there's one line, like ideal green score is one additional story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3272.443s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious, like how does that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3276.025s">[Callahan]</a>: I think we haven't passed the green scoring yet, so I'm curious what that looks like if we pass this and we do green score later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3288.889s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm just curious about how that fits together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3717.503s">[Callahan]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3717.883s">[Callahan]</a>: Just a quick question, since Director Hunt had mentioned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3722.966s">[Callahan]</a>: There was like a sort of adult stuff allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3727.448s">[Callahan]</a>: Where is that going to be re-added back in here on this map?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3112.782s">[Callahan]</a>: I just wanted to note that I was actually kind of peeking through the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3118.946s">[Callahan]</a>: Just now, definitely it specifically calls out the parking of the senior center that that must be that that must be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3130.314s">[Callahan]</a>: I think replaced or continued at least the number of parking spaces, but it also talks about the idea that the parking that is created has to not only consider the senior center, but it also has to account for new business development in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3148.67s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm not saying that what's in the RFP, sorry, I'll talk to the, I'm supposed to talk to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3153.814s">[Callahan]</a>: I'm not saying that what's in the RFP is definitely what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3158.118s">[Callahan]</a>: will happen in the end product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3159.899s">[Callahan]</a>: But I think that it just so that you know, it is in the RFP specifically that those requests are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3167.244s">[Callahan]</a>: And then this you coming to this meeting is absolutely fantastic, because, you know, it has to come through this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3174.129s">[Callahan]</a>: So we are now extra aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3176.81s">[Callahan]</a>: I also would love to be in one of the future<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3181.053s">[Callahan]</a>: listening sessions at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3184.094s">[Callahan]</a>: And we can even specifically bring up this topic of the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3188.956s">[Callahan]</a>: And, you know, as we go forward, I think there will be other public meetings about the development that is going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3196.82s">[Callahan]</a>: So I really appreciate all of your comments, and we will take them to heart and we will, you know, make sure to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3202.862s">[Callahan]</a>: be pushing forward as the RFP moves forward through the process, that we will make sure that not only are there enough spaces for the senior center, but also for the growing needs of parking in Medford Square as it grows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3948.987s">[Callahan]</a>: I had a thought as we were discussing this because I and I do remember going to some of those public participation community events organized by the planning department to discuss these three lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3963.391s">[Callahan]</a>: And I, I wonder if there is something of a timing problem because you know that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3970.473s">[Callahan]</a>: At least it was a year and a half ago, or over a year ago for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3974.335s">[Callahan]</a>: And I think what may happen is that when it's so far away from a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3982.599s">[Callahan]</a>: People might not realize that it's going to impact them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3989.163s">[Callahan]</a>: And then when it becomes like now there's an actual RFP and it's already been sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3994.488s">[Callahan]</a>: And so now people are worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3996.85s">[Callahan]</a>: So I'm wondering if maybe, you know, we can have like just a chit chat with the administration and talk about maybe having, spreading the community meetings in such a way that there are some community meetings closer to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4014.425s">[Callahan]</a>: or like before or after an RFP goes out, because now that it's becoming a reality I think people are realizing the way that it's going to impact their lives in a way that a year and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4025.137s">[Callahan]</a>: It wasn't, it didn't seem like something to attend so anyway, I'm just thinking about that as something that maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4033.826s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, if the administration is in fact, you know, we are having these community meetings, but the timing isn't lining up with what people need in terms of it being really applicable to their lives and then wanting to take the time out to come to these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4048.861s">[Callahan]</a>: So I think I may just have a little, and I might talk to some folks in the administration about that possibility of changing the timing of some of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.182s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6485.423s">[Callahan]</a>: So on page 22 of 39, I just have one question, which is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6493.809s">[Callahan]</a>: And I just want to make sure there's not a typo in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6496.131s">[Callahan]</a>: I really remembered, and tell me if I'm misremembering, that the height, the building height differential between MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3 was more gradual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6506.942s">[Callahan]</a>: These MX-1 numbers and MX-2 numbers are identical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6509.604s">[Callahan]</a>: And I really thought that it stepped up between MX-1 and MX-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6513.348s">[Callahan]</a>: Is that not accurate, page 22 of 39?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6521.872s">[Callahan]</a>: Yeah, yep, 22 of 39 of the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6526.053s">[Callahan]</a>: I thought there was a step up between MX1 and MX2 and not like they're identical and there's a giant leap to MX3 in terms of height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6567.487s">[Callahan]</a>: And if I may, I also noticed that co living is explicitly denied in MX one, two and three, which is probably fine, because I'm guessing that those are all going to be one and two bedroom places that are built there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6585.736s">[Callahan]</a>: But just a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7166.807s">[Callahan]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7167.467s">[Callahan]</a>: I just have three questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7170.208s">[Callahan]</a>: My first question is at these times in the past, did they have other cost of living adjustments or raises?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7176.649s">[Callahan]</a>: Or are these the only ones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7179.27s">[Callahan]</a>: And my second question is just about parking union titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7183.671s">[Callahan]</a>: Does this include everyone in the department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7185.752s">[Callahan]</a>: I just want to understand what parking union titles means, and I understand that it's part of contract negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7195.914s">[Callahan]</a>: I mean, my third question is a little more broad, probably not really able to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7204.957s">[Callahan]</a>: So I assume that the reason that we're looking only at raising parking right now is because of union negotiations rather than raising salaries of other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7986.922s">[Callahan]</a>: You don't you don't touch the cemetery soil removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7991.585s">[Callahan]</a>: You know, I saw this on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7992.466s">[Callahan]</a>: And I was assuming that was part of the Halloween zombie uprising initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8003.334s">[Callahan]</a>: But I thought it was part of the whole business from Tim McGivern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8006.556s">[Callahan]</a>: Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.159s">[Callahan]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8010.86s">[Callahan]</a>: The Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8013.062s">[Callahan]</a>: You're making me say it four times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8140.165s">[Callahan]</a>: Actually stole my thunder because I was going to ask about that specifically, but I know the tree inventory is, you know, going to be done soon and just was going to ask about the plans for like how to keep that up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9056.943s">[Callahan]</a>: I was only going to say that I did walk by this yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9062.005s">[Callahan]</a>: And there's a, I mean, you can see the retaining wall that has, you know, just totally fallen all the way down the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=9069.289s">[Callahan]</a>: It's, it really looks like it's needs immediate attention.<br><br>
