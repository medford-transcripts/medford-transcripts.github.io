 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1385.1s">Hi,</a> I'm Nate Merritt, and I'm asking for your vote to represent all of Medford as your next city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1390.981s">And</a> I swear I do own a tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1392.442s">Sorry</a> about not wearing that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1394.822s">I'm</a> running because I think we can get the city on a much better path than it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1398.543s">I'm</a> an engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1399.343s">I</a> fix things. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1400.603s">I</a> also help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1401.423s">I</a> was an EMT and a firefighter for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1404.104s">In</a> fact, last month when I walked into Tanook, and I found a child bleeding from the back of his head, I decided to step up and help, because that's what people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1412.686s">And</a> I did, and I'm willing to do it in a larger role. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1415.472s">Why</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1416.153s">Why</a> not these fine folks? <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1417.915s">Because</a> I'm going to stay laser focused on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1420.318s">Not</a> national, not state issues, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1423.081s">That's</a> the job at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1425.123s">And</a> maybe if we took all these meetings and this negative energy that's been going on to ODARC 30 in the morning, trying to relitigate international foreign conflicts and trade embargoes, <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1436.68s">and</a> instead focused it maybe on Riverside Ave and the Anheuser-Busch property, which now the MBTA picked up, then maybe we wouldn't be 600,000 in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1445.471s">We</a> just passed an override for 500,000 to fix our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1448.414s">So</a> who's gonna make it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1449.456s">And</a> the answer is all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1451.478s">That's</a> not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1452.479s">That's</a> not a recipe for success. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1455.098s">I</a> want to try to capitalize on the things that the city of Medford has. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1458.159s">We're</a> not Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1459.28s">We</a> have Interstate 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1460.781s">We've</a> got the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1461.981s">We've</a> got a lot of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1463.062s">Let's</a> use it and not try to turn this into the next 15-minute city like the socialist playbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1469.124s">Let's</a> stop the nonsense of saying single-family homes are a thing of the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1472.066s">They're</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1472.946s">The</a> city of Lowell, which is twice the population of Medford, has plenty of single-family zoning, and I think we can, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1480.129s">So,</a> in fact, that's what draws people to Medford, including me and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1484.41s">Let's</a> take a smart look at zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1486.333s">This</a> isn't an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1487.355s">I'm</a> pretty qualified to tell that being a former firefighter in EMT, we can take our time like we did with the charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1493.424s">It's</a> not emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1494.145s">Let's</a> do it right the first time and not try to be like the Titanic going into an iceberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1499.806s">I</a> want places in Medford for kids to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1501.587s">I've</a> got two Bambinos, and especially in the wintertime, where do you bring them? <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1504.709s">We</a> go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1505.469s">You</a> go to Jordan's, you go to Malden, you go everywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1508.29s">I</a> want people from Assembly Row to come here and bring their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1511.332s">Maybe</a> a sky zone, bigger than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1513.453s">Maybe</a> a place to fly indoor drones. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1515.014s">There's</a> a lot of things we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1516.495s">But</a> if our zoning, we take up every commercial spot and turn it into mixed-use residential, you're never gonna have a spot for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1522.698s">I</a> think the city needs some balance and we need to restore some balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1526.002s">Industrial</a> and commercial is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1527.844s">It</a> helps pay for our roads, our public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1531.848s">And</a> I think with your vote, we can move the city forward together. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1536.113s">Let's</a> make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1537.254s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council 08-05-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12509.058s">Nate</a> Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12511.439s">It's</a> not going to be any surprise to any of you sitting behind the rail that I'm opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12515.16s">I</a> have said it twice in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12517.721s">It's</a> kind of funny how there was a meeting tonight, and we're once again talking about a very divisive issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12525.484s">At</a> the same time, literally from 5 to 8 p.m., there was a really nice event happening in the city that was unifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12532.347s">It</a> was the National Night Out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12535.545s">And</a> a councillor can roll his eyes at me and I suppose it's a free country so we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12538.949s">Thank</a> you councillor Levin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12540.571s">Please</a> direct your comments to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12542.434s">Sure,</a> enforce the rules for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12544.977s">So</a> that's an even handedly please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12546.919s">So</a> I get my time and I can use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12550.278s">You're</a> dividing the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12551.778s">Again,</a> you had a wonderful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12554.059s">It</a> was a nice family event. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12555.839s">I</a> got to sit there and show my kids that, you know, police officers are people just like the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12562.761s">And</a> none of them would ever want to discharge their weapon on someone unless they had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12567.202s">Their</a> job is to serve and protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12570.163s">They</a> can't do that with bubbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12571.923s">I</a> wish they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12572.943s">Everyone</a> wishes they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12574.324s">There</a> isn't a person in this room that wants to see anyone get hurt, especially the paramedic here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12578.005s">I</a> think that's a fair statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12581.227s">So</a> the Councilor rolling his eyes, I wonder if he's gonna resign his commission because everything that he uses to defend this country, it's not the Department of War, it's the Department of Defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12590.995s">They</a> changed it in forties for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12593.498s">You're</a> gonna resign your commission, put your money where your mouth is? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12596.3s">What</a> about everyone else in this room? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12597.501s">You're</a> gonna sit there and get rid of your cell phones because they're made with plastic and oil. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12601.865s">How</a> about medical technology? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12604.107s">We're</a> just gonna sit there and go back to the stone age and we use only metal. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12607.37s">We'll</a> be back in the civil war era. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12609.918s">It's</a> a Pandora's box you've opened and there's no good answers for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12613.039s">All</a> it does is divide the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12614.959s">And</a> everyone at this point, everyone likes to eat in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12618.22s">Farming</a> is used with fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12619.92s">I</a> wish it wasn't, but that's not the reality of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12623.141s">So</a> how many of you behind the rail are then gonna support the great reformation and 15 to 60 million people dying of starvation? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12630.782s">Let's</a> have it in this country today. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12632.223s">Love</a> it, let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12634.137s">It's</a> not realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12636.038s">This</a> is virtue signaling, it's divisive, and it's not local in solving local Medford problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12643.86s">Stop</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12644.76s">I've</a> said it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12646.281s">Other</a> people agree, you pick this night because other people would be distracted with an event that was planned many months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12654.434s">And</a> you could have done this on a different night in the council schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12657.176s">And</a> you can laugh too, Councilor Bears, but it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12660.139s">That</a> was scheduled well beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12662.541s">So</a> you picked this night intentionally hoping people would stay home and they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=12666.123s">So</a> congratulations again on dividing the city.

<a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10367.405s">Anybody</a> who follows the stock market knows that NVIDIA stock is triple. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10370.808s">Great</a> investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10371.809s">How</a> good do you think all the servers that are powered by NVIDIA chips <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10375.944s">is</a> for the environment, the electrical consumption, the processes to make those chips. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10381.786s">I</a> think you've opened up a Pandora's box. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10384.627s">And</a> there are plenty of good people in this city that work for companies and aren't necessarily warmongers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10391.249s">But</a> now you've made it this city unfriendly for several companies and industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10395.75s">And</a> it doesn't surprise me that General Electric picked up and left. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10398.98s">Because</a> they probably saw this one coming down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10401.201s">And</a> if that's in Boston, where they said they were going to have their headquarters, well, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10405.023s">They</a> make any of their revenue from manufacturer sale of weapons of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10410.246s">They</a> also make a lot of very good products that help people, including in health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10415.309s">So</a> I urge you to reconsider the language of this and stop dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10419.332s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-05-28_dARoc_Yp358/2025-05-28_dARoc_Yp358.html">Medford Happenings w/ Nate Merritt</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=94.469s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=94.849s">Well,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=95.41s">Thanks</a> for the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=97.551s">So</a> my name's Nate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=99.452s">I'm</a> actually a systems engineer, bachelor's and master's out of UMass Amherst. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=104.396s">I've</a> been working as an engineer for 17 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=107.358s">I</a> was born and raised in Western Mass, so I am not from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=110.4s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=110.9s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=112.742s">I</a> moved out here in around 2009 and met my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=118.565s">And</a> I actually knew her from college before, but we got together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=121.827s">And</a> yeah, so my mom was a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=124.349s">My</a> dad was a fireman. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=126.27s">And</a> he was on the job for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=130.633s">And</a> I grew up on a small tree farm. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=132.954s">And</a> it's something I still keep up today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=135.576s">So</a> I myself went to the fire service, and it's funny, because my dad would say, son, don't go into the fire service. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=142.384s">There's</a> a lot of politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=143.886s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=144.646s">So,</a> well, sorry, dad, because not once, now, but twice.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=149.892s">So</a> I'm actually 25 years now as a MAS certified EMT. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=155.098s">and</a> I'm a private pilot, husband, I got two young boys, they're great, and I bought my home on Riverside Ave in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=163.545s">About</a> five months later, after first buying my home, my welcome to Medford was a car crashing through my front yard, taking out my whole front fence, and it hit the building next door.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=173.252s">And</a> that's what brought me to the City Council my first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=176.614s">There</a> was something happening at the building next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=180.296s">They</a> were going to open a business and I was worried about the traffic flow because it's probably one of the strangest intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=186.26s">You</a> can see where the stoplight is before the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=189.442s">And</a> so I just raised a concern because of the traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=192.204s">I</a> didn't want to see anyone else get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=194.105s">So</a> that brought me to City Council and since then I've tried to offer practical solutions <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=200.087s">whenever</a> I can, not just be a complainer, but try to offer some solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=204.269s">So</a> for example, and I don't even remember when it was, but there was talk of needing money for, I don't know if it was the fire station, the library, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=214.174s">Instead</a> of raising taxes, I said, hey, what if you gave people the option in their property tax bill to make a donation? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=223.298s">And</a> if you look in the upper right corner of your property tax bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=227.138s">you'll</a> see a spot to make a donation for the library, the police station, or the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=234.745s">And</a> that was an idea I came up with during public comments at a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=238.949s">So</a> obviously, someone heard me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=241.144s">They</a> took your advice, it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=243.305s">And</a> there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=244.306s">Yeah,</a> that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=247.448s">I'm</a> a person I believe in limited government. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=250.61s">We're</a> five miles from a group of people 250 years ago that maybe thought the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=255.613s">So</a> that said, government should work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=259.085s">and</a> not necessarily the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=261.446s">And</a> we should always be careful if we're infringing on individual liberties. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=264.708s">That's</a> what this country was founded on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=266.508s">But</a> I also understand the need for government.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=294.532s">I'll</a> be honest with you, John, I don't want the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=297.634s">I'd</a> much rather be at home playing with my kids and spending time at city council meetings even now and I've said that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=306.298s">But</a> I think unfortunately we can either complain about it or we can do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=311.58s">So</a> I'm at the point where it's time to try to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=315.062s">I</a> think we need to give a voice back to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=317.563s">I</a> think, unfortunately, the way things have been running for the past two years, for example, you look at recent meetings that have happened zoning, especially in Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=326.508s">And</a> I was there and I saw people for hours sitting there making comments and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=331.43s">And</a> there was, you know, the Community Development Board had incorporated <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=336.545s">suggestions</a> from, you know, the residents, and I watched a city councilor just say, yeah, I don't like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=343.388s">Change</a> it and just go their own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=346.449s">And</a> to me, that's not sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=349.511s">I</a> think that I can also start giving some critical thought to some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=352.652s">I</a> think that people are maybe good intentioned, but I think we need to start weighing pros and cons of things, and especially always asking the question, how does it benefit the residents of Medford today?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=370.183s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=371.164s">So,</a> honestly, I'm kind of tired of sitting back and watching the agenda removing the rights of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=379.812s">So</a> we have rent control on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=381.914s">You've</a> got a tree ordinance coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=383.496s">You've</a> got zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=384.777s">I</a> saw what happened with the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=386.619s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=386.959s">And</a> same thing where the voice of the people was lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=390.062s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=390.703s">Unilaterally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=391.544s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=392.326s">I</a> think our sense of community is deteriorating and there's an agenda and it's being plowed forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=400.658s">They're</a> plowing forward with it, John.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=454.776s">Well,</a> I think something that could be done even today is, you know, sometimes these city council meetings go long and there's a lot of people that want to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=463.919s">And</a> I've been there till 12, 1 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=467.122s">And</a> I've seen people that want to talk, and they go home because they have jobs in the morning or, you know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=473.589s">They</a> just can't stay up that late. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=475.551s">And</a> I've seen sometimes where the agendas have been rejiggered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=478.694s">And</a> we're talking about national issues that <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=483.472s">The</a> city of Medford can impact, but we're sucking the oxygen out of the room instead of dealing with the local ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=488.415s">And</a> people wanna speak about the local issues, but that gets tabled until after 11, 12 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=494.298s">So</a> I think something we could do is if the meeting runs past 11 o'clock, we're done, shut it down, table the rest of the agenda to the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=502.262s">Everyone</a> should be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=503.143s">And</a> when it's running that late, that's not fair to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=505.404s">And</a> we shouldn't be making decisions literally in the dark of the night.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=585.565s">I</a> think people are trying, but, John, if everything was hunky-dory, I wouldn't be running. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=589.947s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=591.459s">I'll</a> be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=593.54s">I</a> think that the administration needs to really consider doing an audit of the city finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=601.283s">We're</a> talking $5 million that's missing from the school committee budget and then found and $34 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=609.666s">We're</a> making Enron and Arthur Anderson look good here.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=618.39s">I</a> think that in terms of the sense of community, there's a lot of red tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=622.894s">I'm</a> gonna tell you a story real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=624.615s">So,</a> I told you I got little guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=626.637s">One</a> of my favorite parks I like to go to is Logan Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=629.359s">There,</a> there's a little fire truck, like playground thing for kids to go play, little kids to play on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=635.083s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=635.864s">And</a> I had my son with me and I noticed the wooden boards were, they were in rough shape and I didn't want my kid to get splinters or any other kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=644.03s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=644.47s">So</a> I called the mayor's office, wrote an email, said, Hey, listen, this is a couple boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=648.731s">I</a> get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=649.772s">I'm</a> willing to go fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=651.312s">I</a> don't want to just go start ripping up, you know, pressure treated wood and putting bolts in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=655.953s">I'll</a> have the cops down.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=659.034s">So</a> I said, Hey, can I get some top cover and just let them know what I'm willing to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=662.035s">And</a> this is on my own nickel, my own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=664.596s">This</a> is sawing a couple boards and installing a couple carriage bolts and nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=668.297s">This</a> isn't rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=669.477s">I'm</a> an engineer.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=671.458s">I</a> hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=672.759s">It</a> became a whole production and I talked with, you know, she put me in touch with some of the parks folks and nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=679.605s">And</a> then a couple months later it got fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=681.587s">And</a> meanwhile, I've got to watch my kid like a hawk and I'm working like for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=685.39s">And</a> this was initially something that was donated to the city by a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=691.036s">So</a> it's not like the city wound up purchasing it or something originally either. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=695.059s">So</a> there are people willing to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=699.267s">you</a> know, help out the community and not necessarily for any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=702.15s">I</a> mean, that's volunteerism and that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=704.233s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=704.653s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=704.974s">I</a> think if we had a better sense of community and maybe we find a way to eliminate some of the red tape, you'll find people who are willing to pitch in.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=771.703s">I</a> think that zoning is a huge concern overall, and I know there's a lot of chatter about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=777.427s">I</a> think my personal view is it's something we should look at, but it's like everything else, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=783.132s">Extremes</a> are not necessarily good in general, in any system, in any government, in any operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=791.734s">So</a> that said, I think right now what we're seeing is essentially it could be mass gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=797.86s">There's</a> a lot of rezoning happening all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=800.162s">I'll</a> give you an example again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=801.383s">There's</a> a talk of we need more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=805.226s">I</a> ask the question, what is affordable to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=810.031s">I</a> have two kids in daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=811.292s">I</a> have a mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=816.057s">And</a> all the other expenses that go along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=819.841s">And</a> I still somehow afford it, but we've had to make choices along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=826.688s">So</a> more supply in the city of Medford, I don't think is gonna move the needle at all in terms of the cost of rent, the cost of mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=836.98s">So</a> we're going to go increase the supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=838.281s">And</a> I heard from a city councilor that said, well, I'm not going to go explain the details of supply and demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=844.423s">I</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=846.164s">But</a> this is like attacking a tank with a toothpick. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=848.425s">Because</a> there are greater economic forces at play than anything the city of Medford can influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=853.267s">So</a> why are we addressing the zoning to begin with? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=856.208s">Is</a> it for the needs of the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=857.749s">And</a> what's the benefit for the current residents of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=861.327s">So,</a> my concern with the zoning really is more about the commercial and the industrial side.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=866.749s">A</a> lot of people don't know this, but commercial and industrial pay twice the amount the residents do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=872.331s">And</a> for every commercial business or industrial zone you lose, who picks up the tab? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=878.193s">The</a> other commercial businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=879.873s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=887.173s">I'm</a> talking taxes, but also wear and tear on your services. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=891.897s">Your</a> fire, your police, your EMS, your roads, your schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=894.519s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=895.259s">All</a> that has to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=898.602s">My</a> house is a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=900.984s">That's</a> why I came to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=901.984s">I</a> wanted a single family home, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=905.227s">Some</a> people are meant for condos, and I'm not one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=907.569s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=907.889s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=908.489s">That's</a> part of what attracted us to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=912.332s">We</a> know how that right now my house under the new plan will be zoned for three family So they will tear my house down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=919.498s">They'll</a> buy it from me for whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=920.779s">Let's</a> say we're 750 today Yeah, someone else could buy it for 750 000 and have their family And and and use a starter house. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=929.006s">Yeah</a> instead Contractor's gonna come <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=933.357s">buy</a> it, tear it down, turn it into a triplex, and sell each unit for a million dollars.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1004.285s">I</a> think the question isn't how do we get economic growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1008.249s">The</a> city is not a publicly traded Wall Street company. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1011.933s">What's</a> the metric? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1012.634s">And</a> I've asked that publicly before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1014.135s">It's</a> not revenue dollars coming in and every year you want more revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1019.621s">There</a> is no earnings ratio on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1025.227s">The</a> metric in this case should be sustainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1028.363s">That's</a> what we should be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1030.045s">And</a> when you have industry leaving, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1034.409s">We</a> need to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1035.49s">It's</a> not growth, it's just keeping what we have at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1037.952s">Let's</a> try to work that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1039.554s">Example,</a> August Bush, down on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1044.258s">Before</a> the overrides came in, right, they probably read the tea leaves and they had a choice to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1048.842s">Do</a> they operate out of Quincy or do they operate out of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1052.491s">They</a> chose Quincy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1053.891s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1054.552s">So</a> now, the latest I heard, you tell me if you've heard any different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1057.913s">I</a> know Market Basket was maybe considering it, but so was the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1061.634s">And</a> the MBTA is the lead bidder. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1064.374s">They're</a> the highest bidder last I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1066.255s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1067.155s">That's</a> over 20 acres, and it's like 24 acres of property, commercial property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1071.276s">Yes,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1072.597s">So</a> if the MBTA winds up actually purchasing that property, that's 24 acres worth of commercial tax revenue gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1081.079s">Because</a> the MBTA, they'll pay the permits and fees to build their structures, but then they don't owe a dime for taxes afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1086.882s">So</a> that burden is going to shift to the remaining commercial industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1092.966s">And</a> this just begins quicksand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1095.487s">It's</a> a spiral. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1097.219s">So</a> I think, and there's plenty of vacant commercial buildings, it's not just in Medford, I've seen it actually in Malden too, near where the Aviva Trattoria is, near Exchange Street in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1108.524s">Big</a> sign, 300,000 square feet available. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1112.906s">Across</a> the street from my house, 400 Riverside Ave, 100,000 square feet available.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1118.328s">I</a> think we really should be focusing on and talking with them, how do we get these buildings filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1124.871s">In</a> terms of the local area, <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1126.852s">You've</a> got Wooburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1129.373s">Wooburn's</a> got a lot of industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1131.734s">When</a> people want to go build buildings here, they go to Wooburn to go get their heavy equipment, to get their building materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1138.797s">They</a> buy steel there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1140.818s">These</a> aren't things that necessarily negatively impact the surrounding community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1145.08s">In</a> fact, they've done a really good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1146.741s">Malden.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1148.301s">Malden's</a> got the Panadosi Bakery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1151.923s">They</a> make bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1152.963s">You've</a> got the New England Coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1154.164s">They</a> have a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1155.204s">You've</a> got National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1157.288s">What</a> are we making, Medford?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1160.71s">Sausage.</a> 
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1162.651s">I</a> love Bianco sausage, don't get me wrong.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1165.173s">But</a> that's what we're making now, is sausage.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1169.115s">Absolutely,</a> if you've never been to Bianco's, go.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1174.298s">We</a> have vocational schools, we're one of the few in the area, we should be promoting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1179.521s">Unit</a> Man's the nearest one, that's up in Lexington, and a lot of people don't wanna drive that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1184.444s">And</a> we gotta use the river, <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1186.87s">We're</a> unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1187.591s">We've</a> got a river, we've got interstate access, we've got major routes and highways, and we've got the T. We should be capitalizing on that and fostering it.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1208.869s">Anything</a> that brings people from out of the city into the city to spend money and support the local economy.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1271.054s">I</a> think the fact that we passed two overrides, and don't take my word for it, look at the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1278.037s">You</a> had the city council president and you had the mayor dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1282.209s">at</a> the thought, not the thought, but at the fact that people now are only paying only $400 more a year in their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1290.891s">How's</a> that working out? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1294.391s">That's</a> my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1295.531s">I</a> mean, spending is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1297.932s">Sometimes</a> tax increases are necessary, but nobody should ever be happy about it, and certainly nobody should ever be excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1304.513s">I</a> think that was the wrong attitude to have on that, and that was a little unprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1309.335s">So</a> that said, also, we've got a lot of lawsuits happening in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1313.257s">That</a> needs to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1314.038s">That's</a> not doing anybody any favors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1315.539s">And</a> that's a waste of taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1318.02s">And</a> then there's other little gems, which I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1320.822s">You</a> want to pay people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1322.083s">You</a> want to have nice things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1323.844s">But</a> when you go back to the well, now you've got to start really taking a hard look and understanding what are my needs versus my wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1331.088s">I</a> deal with this with my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1333.25s">We</a> all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1334.311s">And</a> when I see that we're paying two grand a year for a poet laureate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1338.814s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1339.615s">But</a> you asked for 500,000 for roads and streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1344.559s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1345.86s">I</a> got to wonder what else is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1347.401s">And</a> again, when you start seeing millions that are going missing and people refuse to do an audit, again, this is making Enron look good folks.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1396.457s">There's</a> a few things in Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1398.118s">And</a> you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1399.298s">Normally,</a> the things you would learn in school, I didn't have that opportunity, because I know about the things instead in Western Mass.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1405.719s">In</a> my school, we learned about General Knox, and he went and captured a whole bunch of cannons from Fort Ticonderoga and brought a little caravan through the state of Massachusetts, including my hometown, what's now Route 20, and parked them on Dorchester Heights and liberated Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1421.975s">So</a> that's one of the things that brought my hometown to fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1424.717s">Medford</a> built clipper ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1426.899s">Medford</a> had brickyards. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1429.281s">Paul</a> Revere rode through on the way to go warn about the British trying to interfere with some patriots over in Lexington and Concord. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1438.968s">Apparently</a> there's some rum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1440.743s">that</a> Medford is known for.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1450.371s">So</a> one of the ways I learned some of the history is from the Mystic River Bend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1454.815s">It's</a> down behind the McGlynn schools and around the corner from where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1459.759s">And</a> so I went and I took some pictures yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1464.243s">I</a> went out in the rain because I wanted to make sure my information was accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1467.486s">The</a> signs look about the same rough shape that they did when I first saw them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1471.028s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1471.588s">And</a> it's sad because, I mean, we have community preservation funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1476.971s">To</a> me, this is literally preserving your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1479.312s">It's</a> in the name, Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1481.033s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1481.453s">Some</a> of those signs are unfortunately in such disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1484.234s">There's</a> graffiti on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1485.635s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1485.835s">And</a> there's a lot of great info that talk about the river, how it used to be salt marshes and where throughout the years where it changed the ecology. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1494.159s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1494.519s">Now</a> there's graffiti on them and they're barely readable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1497.4s">One</a> of them looks like it was melted in the sun or something.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1500.66s">It's</a> a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1501.18s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1501.56s">I</a> think we really should be taking care of our city better.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1521.404s">But</a> if you show <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1523.33s">that</a> you care about your city, maybe you won't get trashed as easily.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1621.413s">I</a> don't, I don't love that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1623.135s">I</a> don't think anyone loves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1624.316s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1624.696s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1625.617s">And,</a> uh, driving down my street, I don't know what am I driving down roads in the city of Medford or am I in a, you know, looking at Germany, occupied France and world war II. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1636.733s">Not</a> sure.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1638.174s">A</a> couple potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1639.174s">Not</a> sure what happened here.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1641.915s">Maybe</a> I like a little bit of history.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1669.485s">We</a> eat the ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1670.145s">We</a> watch the train go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1671.285s">My</a> kid loves trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1672.186s">We</a> literally get to see the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1673.366s">And</a> we'll sit there and just watch the bell.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1726.471s">If</a> there's a hot topic going on, you might find me at the podium at a city council meeting on a Wednesday night.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1778.715s">And</a> I do have an email address that people can reach me at.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1783.418s">It's</a> meritformedford at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1786.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1786.8s">So,</a> two R's, two T's. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1788.481s">And</a> it's F-O-R, not the number four, but that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1791.823s">And</a> I got a website that I'm working on, but it's not up yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1794.804s">So</a> I don't have an apparatus working my campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1798.806s">This</a> is a grassroots, you know, thing, so.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1808.15s">So</a> in the meantime, the email's good, or come for me at a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dARoc_Yp358&t=1812.308s">Thanks,</a> John.<h2><a href="../2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc/2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc.html">City Council Meeting 04-08-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15547.923s">Nate</a> Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15550.625s">Just</a> a question for you, sir, because I know there were a lot of motions, I'm sorry, amendments that were part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15558.049s">Was</a> there an amendment made to get rid of the one-year <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15563.262s">I'll</a> call it residency requirement for a ward Councilor that was proposed by the mayor.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15596.709s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15596.989s">So,</a> that and the rationale for that, I didn't I've been here the whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15601.531s">So,</a> I was paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15602.752s">I</a> don't know if it was necessarily clear why the
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15613.667s">So,</a> if it was applied to every office, that's something you all would consider if it was applied evenly and the reason why I'm poking at this particular one is because I'm sorry, I'm not putting words in your mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15625.536s">The</a> reason why I'm poking at this is because it's been discussed, you know, by a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15630.0s">This</a> is the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15631.481s">These</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15635.453s">representation,</a> especially in like a ward style, probably, you know, it's good to have someone that knows the ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15642.594s">I</a> don't know how you establish really knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15644.655s">If</a> say you moved in like six months before said election and decided to run for that ward, how much do you really know that ward kind of defeats the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15653.797s">So</a> I guess that to me is a big deal that just changed between what was presented to you tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15661.657s">versus</a> now it's gonna go back to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15664.679s">But</a> I see that this is one of those important things that really should be thought through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15669.021s">And</a> if it's not just for city councilor, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15672.002s">If</a> it's for school committee or mayor, wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15675.824s">But</a> I think the people should be electing people from the city that know the city and not necessarily just, you know, I'll use the term of Johnny come lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15685.769s">If</a> there's a chance to codify that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15688.387s">right,</a> at least be around for a year, know your city, and especially if it's to establish that, knowing the ward, and that's the whole point, maybe a period of residency beforehand isn't a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15699.112s">It's</a> not saying homeowner versus renter, it's just saying you have to, I don't know if it's right, is it residency versus being a voter? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15706.996s">I</a> don't know how that, it's registered voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15710.357s">But</a> in essence, to be a registered voter in that ward, you'd be a resident, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15715.384s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15715.924s">So,</a> so it's it's semantics but but that to me is something y'all should really consider before striking because that I'm a big fan of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15725.411s">I</a> think a lot of the members of the city would be too.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15991.542s">Not</a> a tit for tat, I promise.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15997.286s">You</a> have a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15997.847s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15998.587s">So</a> if this doesn't get onto the November ballot,
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16050.929s">But</a> that could happen in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16052.211s">It</a> doesn't necessarily have to happen in the spring.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16074.005s">I</a> guess my only thing to consider is that this is a big deal that I don't know how turnout necessarily is for voters in spring elections versus November.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16087.494s">So</a> I would think that this is probably one of those things you don't want to have in a special election if it's in the spring versus, and everyone knows, go out on the first Tuesday of the month in November, right?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19084.483s">Ebisu</a> is closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19086.124s">That</a> really sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19087.245s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19089.046s">So,</a> you know, I got the email from, you know, because I'm one of the members and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19094.79s">And</a> I can tell you that, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I first found Medford when I was living, you know, before being resident of Medford would come to the Japanese market. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19105.22s">There</a> used to be one on near Porter Square, and that building that the Japanese market was in there, I think it was called Miso Market, I think at the time, wound up getting torn down, turned into a department complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19118.562s">So</a> this one really seemed out of the blue to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19120.843s">In</a> fact, there aren't many Japanese markets in the whole region. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19125.143s">Ebisu</a> is the only one in 20 square miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19128.064s">Kevin,</a> the owner, is one of the most upstanding shop owners you could ever want. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19134.42s">I</a> don't know if there's anything that the city can do to help him, and it's kind of weird right because it's, you know, oh my god one business, but that business is a grocery store in Medford Square, I mean you all, Clark Kirby's, I'm not going to put you on the spot but I mean if you want to go grab a bite to eat, it's a place where you can go buy something to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19152.767s">There</a> aren't many of the, there's plenty of restaurants, but not a store or shop there's a handful of them, let alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19160.053s">you</a> know, Japanese. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19162.194s">It's</a> just there's a lot of Chinese Korean shops, but not Japanese. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19165.276s">So</a> I think it will be a hit to the community is something that made Medford unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19171.76s">The</a> closest place now is to go to Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19174.401s">So</a> it's one of those economic drivers where you were bringing people in especially Asian community from Malden from other places into Medford that now you won't have that draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19183.687s">So</a> if there are vacant buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19186.906s">that</a> maybe you're looking for a small store I don't know if anyone's reached out to that business but any commercial business is a good thing in the city so just want to mention that to have some answers I think Councilor Tseng has some answers.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19398.448s">It's</a> a business decision, you know, but <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19401.966s">hopefully</a> they know that there's a lot of us in the community that would hate to see them go, that that's a big hit, even though it's such a small store.<h2><a href="../2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs/2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs.html">City Council 03-11-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3526.613s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3530.081s">And</a> to that, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3531.201s">And</a> I think, you know, please don't misunderstand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3533.302s">I</a> want schools to, right, but just saying form fit replacement versus the solar panels that weren't there, that's an upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3542.267s">Is</a> there a dollar cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3543.387s">How</a> many dollars is that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3545.949s">Are</a> there other upgrades? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3546.869s">If</a> they make sense, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3548.27s">Just</a> hoping that that cost breakdown for those options has been presented so people can understand the rationale. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3554.693s">And</a> if it makes sense to buy, buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3556.594s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3557.675s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11770.465s">You</a> have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11773.607s">Just</a> something that came up with this last ordinance, I guess, is zoning change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11779.912s">Drive-thrus.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11781.032s">So</a> I live on Riverside Ave, literally down the street from a new drive-thru that opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11784.795s">Some</a> of you may know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11785.976s">Raising</a> Canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11788.482s">They</a> haven't been yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11789.303s">I</a> haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11789.843s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11790.143s">I</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11790.743s">Is</a> it good? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11791.344s">I'm</a> sure people assumed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11792.465s">Is</a> it good?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11798.789s">Yeah,</a> the sauce is pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11803.932s">So</a> they put it in my neighborhood, which is fine.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11811.117s">What,</a> do you not like the sauce?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11815.279s">Chair,</a> do you not like the sauce? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11818.248s">So</a> that said, it's in my neighborhood, and I don't think my neighborhood is necessarily any less safe or any more safe because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11825.57s">And</a> my neighborhood has had a lot of development over the past few years since I've moved in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11830.731s">So</a> now you have a major corridor on Mystic Ave, and we say, you can't have a drive-through at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11837.693s">I</a> mean, what if Chick-fil-A opened up, which, by the way, is a gold mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11841.134s">And</a> if you like King's Chicken, Chick-fil-A is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11844.882s">just</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11846.022s">And</a> rightfully so, in Woburn, a lot of other people think so, and they get off the highway, and they go to Chick-fil-A, and they pick up their food, and they leave, and they're very prompt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11856.285s">And</a> considering commercial business is part of the lifeblood of this city, I think that restricting, you know, because of this particular issue, right, with drive-thrus, might not be a wise choice given our fiscal situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11872.11s">So</a> maybe I don't know if that's something that can be amended or not to reconsider that particular part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11879.112s">You</a> might wanna reconsider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=11880.532s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4986.629s">All</a> taxable property. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4988.309s">Another</a> thing that is, as far as I know is true, is it's not just property taxes that you don't pay, like if you don't pay them right and there are plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4995.89s">If</a> I don't pay my water bill, can the city put a lien on my property?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5001.151s">And</a> they can own my property. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5003.752s">If</a> you don't pay your bills, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5007.782s">They</a> can put a lien on your property and then they sell it and they keep the entire property in some cases.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5017.827s">But</a> right now, the state of the law is that they can take the entire property, not just the amount that they owe to the city.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5024.671s">Okay,</a> so just this misnomer that number one, you have commercial businesses here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5029.893s">And</a> I think one of the things I've seen over the years, we live around the corner from the Locust Street project, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5036.414s">And</a> everyone was hot to trot, we're gonna build, build, build, build more residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5040.716s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5041.756s">So</a> you have a giant megaplex, I'm sure people there are happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5045.057s">Where</a> do they go to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5047.718s">It's</a> a danger, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5048.498s">We</a> need more, we need more places for people to live, but where do they go to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5053.046s">people</a> don't live in the city and work in the city anymore, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5056.848s">That</a> that model's kind of changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5058.968s">I</a> work in New Hampshire, I got to drive back and forth to New Hampshire to go to work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5063.79s">And</a> that's how I can afford to pay my bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5066.872s">You</a> know, and I sit back and I hear that, you know, there's this <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5072.15s">It's</a> kind of this bad blood of people demonizing people who are fortunate to own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5077.772s">I</a> gave my pennies a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5080.433s">I</a> bought a tiny little house in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5082.314s">This</a> was not my first choice of places to live 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5085.615s">Since</a> I moved in, I had someone drive through my front yard, take out my house, the fence on my property. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5090.737s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, you were here for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5093.238s">That</a> was my first appearance at a city council saying, what the crap? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5098.143s">And</a> since then, my street is still a disaster, and nothing has happened, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5102.525s">Riverside</a> is an abomination. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5106.486s">And</a> the city hasn't been able to afford to pay back for a decade to actually fix that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5111.508s">And</a> I don't see a good plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5113.489s">So</a> if we sit there long term, right, we're gonna go develop Mystic Ave, we're just gonna develop, make everything residential, get rid of it, make it all residential, make it all affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5122.433s">Who's</a> gonna pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5125.267s">Who</a> came in and built the locus street project? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5127.12s">That</a> was a real estate developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5129.983s">And</a> this city government, not you specifically on the council, you guys weren't here. You were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5135.025s">And</a> actually the city council tried to fight that because there was a whole debacle of how that went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5140.646s">There</a> was open meeting law violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5142.767s">The</a> city council couldn't actually use the city solicitor because the mayor, Mayor Burke at the time, had the city solicitor working for the city to actually push that project through. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5153.97s">But</a> how does the city make money? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5156.943s">The</a> city makes money off of permits and fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5158.844s">And</a> every time there's a building built, they want people to pay, developers to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5165.048s">So</a> the city wants these big buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5167.25s">But</a> now you're saying, I don't want big buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5169.091s">I</a> don't want big companies to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5172.353s">Well,</a> what are they going to build? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5173.274s">Are</a> they going to build another 10, 56 square foot house like mine? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5177.176s">You</a> think any developer is going to come in and pay all the fees and the fines that this city levies on to build anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5182.62s">You</a> think it's worth their time? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5186.676s">I</a> just got a quote for new siding on my house, cedar siding. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5189.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5190.621s">Just</a> the materials alone for white cedar, not even the good cedar. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5196.288s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5196.608s">Good</a> cedar, Western red cedar is $2,500 for a hundred square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5202.615s">The</a> crappy stuff is $1,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5204.397s">And</a> that's what I'm looking at to fix my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5207.947s">And</a> there are things I'd rather be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5210.028s">I'd</a> rather buy my kids toys. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5211.488s">I'd</a> rather be spending time with them than being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5214.43s">But</a> I have to make tough choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5216.411s">And</a> the city's got some tough choices to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5219.272s">So</a> before I keep hearing this demonization of property owners and this and that, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5224.694s">Nobody</a> said you had to live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5226.595s">Nobody</a> says I have to live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5230.176s">I'm</a> not from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5232.317s">I'm</a> from Western Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5234.511s">First</a> place I moved to, to get a job was in upstate New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5237.353s">You</a> wanna know where there's plenty of land? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5238.894s">Western</a> Mass in upstate New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5241.676s">You</a> don't have to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5242.797s">Nobody</a> deserves to live here necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5244.918s">It's</a> not a, you gotta work for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5247.02s">Yes,</a> I wish we could sit there and wave and run and be like, everyone can have a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5251.583s">I</a> work, I go to work, I'd rather not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5253.324s">My</a> wife goes to work, she'd rather not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5255.366s">We</a> pay for daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5256.326s">So</a> instead I can, you know, I can go to work to pay for daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5259.308s">It's</a> almost like a break even song. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5261.633s">I</a> mean, these are real expenses that homeowners have. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5264.614s">So</a> every time I hear, oh, we're just gonna pass prop two and a half, because we need, no, I haven't seen it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5269.355s">I</a> think we really need to take a look at where the expenses are too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5272.216s">And</a> Councilor Bears, no offense, but you and I have gone around before and you said, I will not make cuts to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5277.717s">I</a> will not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5278.418s">Some</a> things are absolutely off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5281.358s">Then</a> the same argument back at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5282.899s">Prop</a> two and a half, absolutely off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5286.1s">And</a> then nothing gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5287.56s">And</a> we're at an impasse and the roads are still crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5290.728s">But</a> I don't see a plan, even if you do the prop two and a half, it's an impulse of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5295.37s">You're</a> gonna fix the damn streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5297.971s">There's</a> no plan, you can't possibly afford to fix the streets in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5301.332s">Councilor</a> Marks mentioned that like six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5305.874s">The</a> city doesn't generate enough revenue to do it, so what's the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5309.935s">And</a> it's not build more houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5312.176s">And</a> this affordable housing thing that you're all talking about, great, so a young person wants to go buy a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5318.499s">Okay,</a> what are they going to apply to the city and get $100,000 free from the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5323.746s">Where's</a> it coming from?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5331.169s">Sure,</a> because I have nothing else better to do tonight besides be here, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5334.613s">No</a> offense, but I have other things to do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5337.576s">But</a> this is a long brewing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5339.058s">When</a> I hear terms of misinformation, and I see the keyboard warriors on Reddit coming after people like me that are homeowners, I got to wonder what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5346.706s">And</a> I don't see any comments from you all defending us.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5352.021s">You</a> know what's going on on Reddit, because especially you, Councilor Leming, I see you on Reddit all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5356.864s">I'm</a> sure you're very, very aware.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5361.607s">No,</a> but demonizing homeowners is not okay either.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5369.232s">They</a> are saying it on Reddit.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5374.335s">So</a> what's the misinformation that you're not considering Prop 2.5?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5384.089s">No,</a> it's not a case of revenue, it's revenue minus expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5386.83s">So</a> right now in the current state of expenses...

<a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14091.143s">We're</a> gonna build all new units and there's gonna be affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14093.845s">I've</a> been hearing about housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14095.245s">I've</a> been hearing about linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14096.966s">I've</a> been hearing about all these other taxes that are gonna benefit the area, but my street still sucks and another car can come up over the curb and hit my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14106.231s">Nothing's</a> happened in a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14109.394s">So</a> the first thing I ask is, well, where's the tax money? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14112.935s">So,</a> you know, it's funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14115.216s">I</a> haven't lived in Medford my whole life, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14117.717s">When</a> I came out of college, I couldn't get a job in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14120.458s">I</a> moved to upstate New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14122.899s">It's</a> really cheap to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14123.979s">There's</a> plenty of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14124.979s">If</a> people wanna go live somewhere, I recommend the Syracuse area, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14131.462s">I'm</a> originally from Western Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14134.123s">If</a> you wanna find some housing that's actually relatively cheap, go to Western Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14137.685s">There's</a> good people, good jobs, and they all have funny accents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14141.567s">Yeah,</a> I said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14144.348s">So</a> I know people wanna play to identity politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14146.569s">Yes,</a> I'm white. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14148.13s">My</a> wife is Asian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14149.51s">I</a> have two half babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14151.371s">You</a> know, they're whole babies, half Asian, half white, okay?

<a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14195.708s">I</a> want a gold brick to fall in my backyard so I can afford stuff and fix my crappy house that my wife and I saved up and bought without assistance from my folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14205.674s">My</a> folks are gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14206.655s">So</a> there is no assistance coming from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14209.619s">Right,</a> I have a single family house, you have some problems that y'all are trying to address, and I'm hearing a lot of convolution, it's, we need quantity of housing, we need affordability of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14219.945s">Those</a> two circles don't necessarily need to intersect, they're separate issues and they might have separate solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14226.609s">An</a> affordable house is a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14229.33s">It's</a> not necessarily a multifamily house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14231.571s">So</a> if a person wants to sell their single family house to another family, like we got lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14236.233s">It</a> was a bidding war. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14237.034s">I</a> mean, this is what, and we used to pay it all the taxes and da, da, da, da, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14241.035s">But</a> we got into a single family crappy house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14243.236s">I</a> have an 1100 square foot house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14244.817s">It's</a> a three bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14245.617s">I</a> got two young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14247.038s">I</a> wanna go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14248.158s">Yeah,</a> have a little more room to move, but I can't necessarily make that move right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14253.916s">but</a> I have a job, my wife has a job, we're middle-class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14257.517s">I</a> have no idea what the value of my house is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14259.117s">I</a> wanna say it was like 700,000 or something, which is just ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14262.838s">Okay,</a> I sell it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14264.318s">Where</a> am I gonna go? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14265.059s">I'm</a> gonna go what, pay 800, 900 for the same house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14269.04s">I</a> would literally sell my house and then with the cap gains and everything else, I'd still be in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14274.041s">So</a> now I have a job in New Hampshire just so I can go afford to pay my higher taxes, my daycare for my two kids so my wife and I can both go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14283.8s">which</a> is a mortgage in itself is 1400 bucks a kid and they're not even full time.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14917.319s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14918.419s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14918.82s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14919.22s">Thank</a> you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14921.502s">So</a> and why I was concerned is because right across the street from my house is a vacant commercial property, 400 Riverside Ave, which I was just informed tonight that I guess is not at the moment now being considered for a migrant shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14936.228s">However,</a> one of the reasons that they're in that situation <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14939.489s">is</a> because it's a vacant commercial building. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14941.89s">Now,</a> why it's vacant, I couldn't tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14944.23s">Initially,</a> it was supposed to be, I think, a biotech company was the intent, which to me is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14949.552s">I</a> love commercial business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14950.512s">I</a> love private business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14951.532s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14951.792s">Because</a> it's a place for people to potentially work in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14956.333s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14956.993s">And</a> a large space like that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14960.014s">I</a> caution if we start having <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14963.519s">sticks,</a> then people certainly can go out and rent out space. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14967.042s">This</a> has been demonstrated where Hey, I've got a space, let's make it a migrant shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14970.625s">I</a> mean, there are plenty of other avenues besides business, right to one, they'd want to get income for that building, but then also to avoid on top of that a potential tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14983.181s">I</a> really would like to see some sort of plan for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14987.563s">For</a> instance, city of Malden, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14989.004s">When</a> I want to go, Justin, I'm looking at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14991.504s">Okay,</a> when I want to go and get dim sum with my family, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14994.446s">There's</a> umpteen, you know, Vietnamese, Chinese restaurants, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14997.407s">I</a> can go to dim sum in I think three or four places, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15000.288s">Not</a> Songkran, I went to Songkran last weekend, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15004.73s">Because</a> the other one I can't, the larger one in Malden Center, right, is full, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15012.196s">There</a> was a plan behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15013.737s">I</a> don't think it was completely random where a bunch of Asian businesses said, hey, I'm going to go put one next to the other on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15021.443s">I</a> think there was some coordination by the city of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15026.007s">And</a> it's a place where young people can actually go and get entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15030.27s">There</a> really isn't a lot of that here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15032.432s">So</a> I'd really love to see what a plan for this city is, and including these large industrial and commercial spaces that are vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15039.856s">So</a> not just at the state level, I think there's a lot of local incentives that we could do to, you know, populate some of these commercial spaces in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15049.241s">So</a> my caution is be very careful with the sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15052.263s">They</a> may have unintended consequences.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16451.241s">I'll</a> make it quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16452.603s">Just</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16454.004s">Sorry,</a> I can't ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16455.565s">Ask</a> me and I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16457.346s">Sure</a> thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16459.907s">What</a> about considering if the buildings can't be fixed, maybe it's worth selling the property as a revenue generator for the city, if it makes sense, as a possibility, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16471.795s">Versus</a> if something's really bad and you'd have to tear it down and rebuild it, and you don't know what the city would wanna do with it, maybe it's in a location that's desirable to put something else, be it residential, commercial, industrial, I have no idea, but just as an option four in your list.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2067.116s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2067.576s">Nate</a> Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2070.158s">I</a> am an abutter of this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2072.12s">The</a> address is 400 Riverside Ave for the public that wants to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2077.024s">And</a> I am not satisfied with how the mayor has communicated information to the neighborhood.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2084.25s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2084.951s">Through</a> the chair, I am not satisfied how the mayor has communicated information to the neighbors and the neighborhood and the abutters of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2094.338s">If</a> this was the Locust Street project again, right, this council hired an attorney because the Zoning Board of Appeals dropped the ball, didn't even have a public meeting, violated public meeting law, and the mayor was part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2113.974s">She</a> understood that the residents had a right to information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2117.697s">But</a> I only hear things when I come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2119.578s">So</a> I brought my wife with me tonight, who is an immigrant, and to all the Facebook keyboard warriors out there that want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2127.104s">She's</a> first generation American. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2130.247s">I'm</a> a grandchild of immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2132.248s">I</a> don't have a problem with immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2134.31s">I</a> do have a problem with the way that all the information has been communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2138.533s">This</a> project started in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2143.171s">And</a> there's been nothing officially published until I came here and started asking questions to get them on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2149.733s">And</a> thank you that you all as a body are willing to entertain this, but the mayor is not publishing anything except one Facebook post. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2156.654s">And</a> that's on set. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2160.755s">That</a> is not a way you communicate information and especially to gain information from your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2167.617s">She</a> hasn't talked to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2169.477s">She</a> hasn't talked to my neighbors that I'm on the phone with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2173.143s">So</a> no, I don't think she's got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2176.004s">You</a> know, she does not have a handle on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2178.426s">And</a> honestly, I don't think you do either. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2181.968s">I</a> care about safety of my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2184.389s">And</a> again, for all the keyboard warriors out there that live up in the ivory tower in the hills of this community, you don't live where I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2193.033s">Wegmans</a> has a police guard every night, obviously because it's so safe and they're not worried about any crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2201.667s">But</a> yet New York City, which has one of the most fantastic police forces in the world, you had a Venezuelan migrant in a shelter stabbed by other Venezuelan migrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2213.435s">Bullets</a> fly through windows, bullets fly through siding, and it's my house that could potentially be a target with my two little kids at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2222.081s">So</a> yeah, I got concerns because it's my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2226.604s">Is</a> anyone in this council within view of this building at 400 Riverside Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2230.947s">Just</a> posing the question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2233.449s">Anyone?</a> 
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2240.794s">Okay,</a> through you to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2243.936s">I'd</a> like to hear an affirmative or a negative, quite honestly, from all the members.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2252.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2254.23s">And</a> so it's a simple yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2255.852s">I</a> think that's fair.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2260.758s">The</a> answer is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2261.779s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2262.46s">So</a> I am concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2264.722s">The</a> neighbors are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2267.168s">So</a> if they can't find more housing, this is temporary five days until you just said, there's no housing available. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2274.49s">So</a> then what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2275.79s">What</a> is preventing actually the children from being enrolled in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2278.79s">Because</a> how does the city stop it when the state law says that they have to be allowed to enroll in community? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2286.112s">These</a> are, I think, some critical questions we need answers to in the utopian ideal situation, all's well and they move away in five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2294.114s">How</a> long is this gonna go on for? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2295.334s">How</a> many years? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2298.707s">There</a> are some legitimate concerns, public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2301.348s">How</a> are we gonna address that, even for the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2304.85s">Trash</a> and garbage and logistical things like that that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2311.053s">We</a> have some questions, but apparently now it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2314.254s">So</a> the train's gonna roll over us and you have zero way to influence it, is what I just heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2320.677s">That's</a> unsat. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2322.238s">Madam</a> Mayor, that's unsat. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2325.439s">I'm</a> looking forward to the community meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2328.26s">I</a> think you're gonna have some neighbors that are very concerned, and I hope this council can help us, at least like they tried to do during the Locust Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2337.289s">So,</a> who's gonna pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2338.89s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of questions to get answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2342.573s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2632.032s">Thank</a> you for your comment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2634.336s">And</a> I guess just to the for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2638.689s">I</a> don't think I'm a bigot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2640.25s">I'm</a> just a neighbor who's concerned and I have neighbors, you know, that are, you know, fellow neighbors that are concerned in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2647.232s">And</a> this can directly impact and people like, Oh, what do you mean trash? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2650.713s">What</a> do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2651.053s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2651.573s">I</a> find shopping carts in my yard all the time to begin with, I'd be happy to take them to some other person's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2657.935s">right</a> and load them up in my truck and return them that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2660.256s">It's</a> silly things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2661.556s">But</a> also, like I said, in New York, I'm not making this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2664.797s">This</a> is on the news that there were people getting stabbed and I don't I'm sorry, I don't want that in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2669.738s">So</a> how do we fix it? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2671.138s">And</a> if someone says, Oh, we're going to detail a state police officer at this building every day, then okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2676.359s">That's</a> a potential solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2678.0s">But</a> without any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2680.236s">to</a> get in front of it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2681.576s">Are</a> we just going to sit there and wait for all the problems to boil up? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2684.217s">I've</a> heard from a reliable source that, for instance, that the state has had to train certain migrant communities, that it's not okay to sit there and grope a woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2691.94s">Because</a> culturally, that's okay from where they're coming from, but it's not okay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2696.201s">So</a> I mean, there are some serious issues that don't necessarily fall into the optimum narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2702.583s">that</a> we really need to address it for the good of everyone.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3855.876s">I'll</a> keep it short.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3859.203s">No,</a> but I did want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3862.324s">something</a> that Councilor Leming had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3866.208s">I</a> appreciate statistics, I'm a scientist also, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3869.511s">So</a> definitely some mind meld there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3872.713s">That</a> said, my particular home is probably the outlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3878.639s">And</a> again, this is directly across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3880.641s">So</a> this is where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3882.362s">When</a> my wife was pregnant with my oldest child, just a few years ago, we had someone break into our house <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3890.404s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3891.305s">Not</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3892.146s">And</a> the only thing that saved her from getting hurt was me putting a door in front of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3898.273s">Medford</a> PD was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3899.454s">They</a> came over the detectives, you know, did their thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3903.458s">I</a> scared the person away. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3905.581s">And</a> they eventually caught up with them down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3907.463s">Okay,</a> that's a terrible thing to happen to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3912.865s">This</a> is where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3914.246s">Not</a> only that, during that incident, I found out from Medford PD that, oh, yeah, we arrested someone under your porch a couple years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3922.273s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3922.573s">When</a> the officers are familiar with my backyard, because they've had to come in and find people, I think it was shoplifters or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3931.141s">This</a> isn't about race. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3933.939s">My</a> concerns are literally because number one, there's crime in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3937.622s">It's</a> a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3938.822s">The</a> businesses that are there actually are concerned about, like there's a lot of mechanic shops and so on and so forth, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3946.027s">Vehicles,</a> I'm sure you've heard like a legitimate thing where people were cutting off Cadillac converters for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3952.151s">I</a> mean, there's real things that are happening in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3956.414s">So</a> I'd love to hear from the police chief <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3959.281s">right,</a> what the actual crime is by zone to help give you some real data to work from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3966.028s">But</a> I'm going off my personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3967.709s">So</a> now there were two, two crimes committed, literally in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3975.477s">Right,</a> like I said, Wegmans has a police officer for a reason, not because they want to go spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3981.821s">And,</a> you know, like I said, it's great when the police can show up at your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3985.962s">But</a> at the same time, what happens if it's one of my kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3988.302s">Who</a> am I blaming? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3989.283s">Who</a> am I suing? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3990.143s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3991.563s">If</a> we don't protect our people here first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3996.104s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3997.204s">It's</a> I don't care what your race or any of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4001.305s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4002.205s">But</a> I also know when you have like the Occupy Wall Street, when you've had a lot of clusters of people in places that aren't homes, they're not built for homes, bad things can happen to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4014.073s">So</a> I'm a concerned dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4016.735s">I'm</a> okay to say that, but I'd rather not have statistics thrown in my face and say, oh, you know, you're just a, you know, you're just a right wing nut job. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4025.021s">No,</a> I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4026.502s">I'm</a> a concerned dad where already bad things have happened in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4031.125s">That's</a> my concern.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA/2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA.html">City Council 01-09-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6771.985s">So</a> just as a FYI, Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's just me not able to work the website correctly, but I couldn't even find the agenda for tonight's meeting because it's bucketed under 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6782.37s">There</a> is no link for 2024 agendas on the website.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6812.99s">Okay,</a> but the 23 link will still get you to the right Google Drive page to get there.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6837.978s">So</a> that's fine, and I can help then once you guys settle on that date.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6856.45s">And</a> just for clarity, I mean, I'm not opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6859.072s">It's</a> just as a resident literally across the street, my concerns are my family safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6864.115s">That</a> is number one top dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6866.197s">And</a> if there's a plan and <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6869.018s">So</a> I work with government myself and sometimes I find that if you package ideas ahead of time, you can help contribute and shape those things versus waiting for the train to hit you and then backpedal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6882.384s">So</a> my hope is that maybe we can get some engagement locally and have some asks that are constructive to then help the state shape their decision.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_PxdgL7RGrJQ/2024-10-05_PxdgL7RGrJQ.html">City Council 12-19-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2442.689s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry, I thought you did that already.

<a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9217.359s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9218.399s">Do</a> you ever go out like five o'clock at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9222.148s">have</a> to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9222.789s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9223.509s">Uh,</a> some that live in the neighborhood do it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9225.591s">It's</a> convenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9226.351s">I</a> live a half mile away just for, for the folks there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9229.353s">I</a> love chicken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9230.614s">I</a> love small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9231.595s">I'm,</a> I'm, I'm a big, you know, capitalist, you know, proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9234.737s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9236.179s">Um,</a> in fact, I like chicken so much that I've been to Chick-fil-A so many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9239.481s">I</a> know it's the other company, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9241.242s">But</a> they're awesome and they run a good operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9244.064s">So</a> I guess one of my questions for you is, are your peak hours going to be around that five o'clock, six o'clock dinner time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9250.069s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9252.799s">which</a> there's already a traffic issue where that don't block the box is always blocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9258.783s">It</a> doesn't matter how many lines you put on there because nobody can move. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9261.484s">It</a> gets gridlocked to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9263.565s">So</a> without a higher level plan, I don't know how some lines are going to fix that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9271.33s">And</a> then for those of us that just want to go to the grocery store, we'll turn down commercial av. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9275.852s">There's</a> some ways to get around there, but I can see that clogging up pretty quick if this place is successful, which I hope it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9282.62s">I</a> guess my other concern is the actual footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9286.363s">And</a> again, I'm going to cite Chick-fil-A and Woburn because that place is a goldmine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9291.387s">And</a> they have a really good operation, similar to what you're talking about with the two drive-through lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9297.771s">They've</a> got their act together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9299.012s">And</a> it's like a minute or two, if you do your online ordering, you can stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9303.516s">You</a> literally can pull in, get your food, get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9305.877s">It's</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9308.271s">Do</a> you have the right footprint to accommodate the traffic that you might see based on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9312.354s">Someone</a> did some market research and said, this is a good area to put one of these restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9316.117s">And</a> I don't know anywhere else you can get chicken besides Popeye's in Everett, which again has a one-sided access. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9323.542s">It's</a> difficult to get in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9325.483s">But</a> have you done the homework comparably to see that if you get the business like you get in Woburn, are you going to be able to accommodate it without causing a bigger problem to the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9339.99s">I</a> appreciate you Rick Councilor for addressing the commercial have entrance there's also another truck entrance right for stop and shop on 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9351.558s">If</a> you're coming from the south you can turn left and there's that that dumb little sign for stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9356.221s">This</a> is turn right and go through the loading area for stop and shop and all those other businesses to that's another access. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9363.086s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9363.726s">So</a> instead of just commercial where you have all the other, you know, 18 wheelers parked over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9369.332s">My</a> final question is regarding the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9374.536s">The</a> other restaurants in the area it looks like they close up at nine or 10 o'clock at night on some nights and 11 on others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9381.461s">Do</a> you think you're really going to have the business to drive having extended or require the permit all the way to having normal business till midnight, and then deliveries at one that you don't have in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9393.594s">or</a> BU, which quite honestly has a lot more young people that are probably hungry for chicken after 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9402.416s">So</a> those are my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9404.477s">Hopefully</a> you guys can take those into consideration and maybe we can get some questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9407.978s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_plgT6PVUdo0/2024-10-05_plgT6PVUdo0.html">City Council 01-31-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5597.61s">Nate</a> Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5601.331s">I</a> love this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5602.552s">I'm</a> a loyal BJ's customer in the fact that your gas is cheap, it works, it gets me to work back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5610.275s">I</a> think we've already talked tonight about the conditions of the economy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5613.896s">6%</a> inflation is not what it really is with gas compared to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5618.358s">So</a> as a parent, this is a great idea and it saves me a trip from going to Stoneham and back every time I wanna go fill up my gas tank, because you guys have the best prices in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5627.701s">I</a> understand that there's concerns for the residents in the neighborhood and at the same time, I live right in the corner of Lucas street where there was a lot of development forced down our throats. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5638.023s">So</a> the fact that you guys been able to help work out something that's mutually mutually beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5642.784s">It</a> will actually benefit the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5646.145s">I</a> applaud you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5647.345s">So</a> thank you Councilors, because we need some more commercial business in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5652.059s">We</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5653.259s">Residential</a> side is good, but anything we can do to help support commercial business and also people live in Malden, people live in surrounding communities, they will come to BJ's to go get gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5663.743s">They</a> will help bring money into our economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5667.384s">So</a> I fully support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5668.525s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7762.398s">Ethan</a> Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7765.84s">It's</a> more of a question for you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7769.301s">Did</a> you hear about a high school in Western Massachusetts that couldn't turn the lights off since October of 2021? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7775.266s">I</a> do watch Saturday Night Live. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7777.168s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7777.868s">So</a> I know some folks don't necessarily know what I'm talking about, but I'm actually from that town. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7782.292s">That</a> was the new high school that replaced the one that I went to.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7786.075s">I'm</a> also a taxpayer in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7787.776s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7788.297s">So</a> I just found out that, you know, we've been getting a bill for approximately $220,000 because we couldn't turn the lights off with switches because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7796.904s">good</a> intentions for having centrally managed green buildings, but yet <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7804.36s">Information's</a> fuzzy, there isn't a lot out there in the public domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7807.702s">Sounds</a> like it might be because of a computer hacking or something, and therefore it's a centrally managed issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7812.923s">We</a> had teachers literally trying to unscrew light bulbs, I guess, to try to turn the lights off because there weren't local light switches. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7819.405s">So</a> if you adopt this in its current form, are you handcuffing people to build buildings like that where they don't necessarily have local control over their HVAC systems and or lighting, especially when you wanna have, even as, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7833.986s">as</a> a backup, but also just because it makes sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7836.19s">Local</a> control. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7836.951s">So</a> if you can turn the lights off, if you want to, and not necessarily rely on the internet and a program because it's free.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7884.62s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7885.721s">Like</a> I said, good intentions right by all I'm sure that we're involved but at the same time, it's really embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7891.064s">And</a> you've kind of shot yourself in the foot from the green objective when you've literally been just setting energy and money on fire, and yeah, the city can't afford it, quite honestly, to make that kind of mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7901.891s">So</a> just making sure that
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7914.551s">Sure,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7916.172s">As</a> long as you're not handcuffing even private businesses that want to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7920.602s">build</a> a building, right, that they all of a sudden have to adopt something that's remotely, you know, internet only control.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7942.489s">Because</a> chances are, if you did, they'd probably end up hiring him here at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7946.372s">Actually,</a> it may have been, I'm not positive.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7961.385s">Totally</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7963.653s">But,</a> and just as you're doing other, you know, projects in the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7968.016s">Not</a> just the high school, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7969.538s">Yes,</a> yes, no, I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7970.859s">When</a> I find out, I'll let you all know, but as a taxpayer, yeah, we want some heads on pikes for that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7976.363s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8944.735s">You're</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8945.296s">OK,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8946.923s">Has</a> anyone looked into if there's a gap in service, is there something the city can do, and perhaps maybe generate some revenue while helping out the citizens.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=8956.847s">No,</a> no, no, I'm not saying compete with the MBTA but if the MBTA isn't going to move and you do have some infrastructure in place we have school buses we have drivers, perhaps there's an opportunity where the city can help the community and fill in the gap of the MBTA isn't going to cooperate.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9025.481s">Yeah,</a> but this could actually make money instead of the parking department which is losing money.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9044.373s">I</a> didn't want to say it, but if there's other options for folks to use, even just information about what's available is probably helpful in the short term.<h2><a href="../2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE/2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE.html">Medford City Council Meeting 12-20-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3563.757s">So</a> I think some, I appreciate what some of the Councilors have said tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3568.638s">I</a> was watching this on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3570.438s">I</a> had to come down because my kid didn't want to watch this on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3572.999s">He'd</a> rather watch Paw Patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3575.999s">I</a> don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3576.779s">I'm</a> sure some of all of us would too. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3579.92s">I</a> think that there's a lot of, I'll call them corner cases that maybe where some of these blanket policies don't address, you know, if you live on Riverside Ave and you're having work done in your house and you can't pull into your driveway, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3593.771s">and</a> you don't have a permit and you come down to the parking office and they say, no, you can't have a permit to park on this side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3602.274s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3602.534s">No,</a> because you don't live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3604.875s">No,</a> I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3605.395s">But</a> if I actually want to go to work so I can pay my mortgage, pay my taxes, pay the salaries of the fine people working in that office, what am I supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3616.499s">So</a> I think a lot of care and consideration needs to be taken before some blanket policies are put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3624.126s">I</a> really appreciate Councilor Knight, something that you brought up, which was, you know, what is the purpose of having parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3632.548s">What's</a> the scope? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3634.049s">Is</a> the intent to make money for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3639.27s">Or</a> is it instead to keep people from say parking on Governor's Ave and kind of abusing the parking and preventing other people from coming into the city and shopping? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3650.663s">It</a> feels like the scope has been lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3653.165s">If</a> you wanna tax your citizens, tax it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3657.248s">If</a> you're gonna have people pay, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3663.032s">But</a> at least come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3666.335s">But</a> at least come out and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3668.416s">Because</a> if you're having people pay to come shop and spend money in the city of Medford, and most of those people are your residents, then that's in effect a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3681.575s">If</a> it's to keep people from say outside the city, you know, from parking and abusing and using the commuter access that we have, that's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3692.606s">And</a> there's different ways to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3694.387s">So</a> the city of Arlington, town of Arlington, I think it's a town. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3698.331s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3700.493s">Do</a> they have a parking department enforcement and stickers? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3703.977s">When</a> I lived in Arlington, I didn't have a sticker and I was a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3707.519s">I</a> could park on the side and all I had to do is like if I had an extenuating circumstances, you call Arlington PD and say, hi, I'd like to park my car on the street because they have no on street parking for the most part, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3718.388s">They</a> have a, the process is communication and otherwise, okay, we know that plate number. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3725.253s">We're</a> not going to ticket it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3727.675s">It</a> works pretty good as far as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3730.017s">City</a> of Cambridge, you can have a parking permit, you get a sticker and that sticker is, you know, it's a permanent resident sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3736.125s">and</a> you can park anywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3738.847s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, how does it work in Sutton-Merville where you work?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3757.281s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of different ideas in here, and I think we need to find something that fits for Medford, but let's keep in mind the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3763.324s">If</a> the scope is to raise revenue for the city, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3766.825s">If</a> the objective is different and it's to keep people from abusing streets and preventing people from coming outside the city to spend money in our city, which is, I think, what everyone wants, that's a whole different objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3778.83s">So</a> I appreciate y'all maybe keeping that in mind as we go forward and maybe trying to refocus the scope.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4072.57s">Just</a> one other point that I wanted to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4075.793s">Councilor</a> Knight, I thought I heard you correctly, but I want to be sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4078.836s">Did</a> you say that $500,000 of ARPA funding was spent <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4083.928s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4084.448s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4085.309s">Okay,</a> so we spent half a million dollars to buy parking meters for infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4091.931s">Instead</a> of fixing roads, we bought parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4094.232s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4095.772s">When</a> people say generate revenue, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4098.193s">But</a> there's another side of the coin and that's the expense side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4101.294s">So</a> the city's currently looking at a shortfall of at least depending on who's math, Councilor Bears, your math had somewhere around 12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4108.697s">Mayor</a> says somewhere around 3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4111.438s">She</a> said, she said eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4113.75s">Excuse</a> me, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4114.331s">She</a> said eight, she only wanted to fix three. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4116.052s">Eight,</a> oh, okay, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4118.534s">I</a> guess the point is that even if it's a revenue generator, and I'm sure the gentleman behind me might be disappointed what I'm about to say, I'm sorry, but if we're paying more salaries for a problem that doesn't exist versus if the cost is $0 from the city, if we don't enforce parking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4135.386s">We</a> just went back to before, no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4138.869s">We're</a> unfortunately probably not gonna pay those people working that office.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4181.277s">Okay,</a> yeah, as long as it's not just a revenue side, but it's actually net revenue minus expenses, if that's the objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4190.805s">And</a> otherwise, if it's generating revenue, but it actually costs more to do the enforcement, even though you're generating revenue, that's not a good solution either. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4198.11s">So</a> I want to point out there's a difference between revenue and expenses.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6124.935s">Please,</a> Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6128.177s">Regarding</a> receivership, Chelsea, is that the closest community that was involved in that recently? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6138.662s">Chelsea,</a> Lawrence, Springfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6140.402s">So</a> I'm gonna throw wacky idea out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6146.245s">I'm</a> looking at you, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6147.706s">You're</a> the money guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6148.826s">You're</a> the numbers guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6150.147s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6156.85s">If</a> we can't pay our bills, okay, you go into receivership, there's some sort of restructuring that happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6162.392s">Usually</a> when that happens with businesses at least, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6165.253s">Some</a> people, you know, people lose work, people get fired or laid off or so on and so forth because there's, usually there's a plan and part of that plan is painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6174.996s">What</a> if there's no more Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6179.018s">We</a> take the East side and it goes to Somerville, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6182.799s">And</a> we take the West side and that goes to Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6185.585s">or</a> Winchester, and we just carve it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6187.826s">Take</a> the land, dissolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6190.427s">I'm</a> against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6192.228s">I'm</a> not saying anyone's for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6194.009s">No,</a> no, no, no, no, no.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6196.93s">Yeah,</a> where I'm going with this is unfortunately, I just want people to be careful that as far as services.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6205.454s">I'm</a> not suggesting we had, but it also might be out of your hands.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6340.962s">I</a> guess I would ask you this, because I know you do a lot of homework, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6344.605s">There's</a> other communities that have gone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6346.647s">What's</a> the trigger? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6348.489s">and</a> maybe we can be proactive and not dig ourselves into that spot.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs/2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs.html">City Council 07-19-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10107.973s">Fine,</a> you have a person who functions only as a night watchman according to his own admission. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10113.875s">I</a> don't know how much his salary is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10115.876s">It's</a> nine o'clock on a Friday or Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10118.837s">Nobody's</a> coming in and out of that parking garage or the DPW garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10123.538s">You</a> couldn't contract that out to Securitas or some other function instead of paying that person's salary plus their retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10131.081s">I</a> think there's things that we can do to look at the budgets and spend more efficiently <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10136.802s">There's</a> plenty, Tufts University, we've talked about this, Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10141.606s">There</a> may be ways we can actually bring in some metrics and bring in some data analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10146.309s">I</a> think it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10147.489s">It's</a> been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10150.171s">What's</a> the number of personnel in the city by department and how much has been, what is that number year over year? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10156.896s">I</a> don't expect you to have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10158.677s">The</a> problem is it's not published. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10161.417s">Let's</a> put it to the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10162.558s">Okay,</a> well, the voters gotta be educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10164.699s">The</a> voters need to be able to find the data and make educated decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10169.021s">And</a> no offense, you're not gonna take Zach Baer's word for it because you're only one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10173.063s">And</a> even you don't have all the data, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10176.125s">Trust</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10177.986s">Trust</a> me, I'm from the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10179.387s">I'm</a> here to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10181.872s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10182.592s">No,</a> you wanna present the data and let people make educated decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10185.994s">There's</a> no possible way you could do that.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10203.203s">I</a> think it is when you have someone saying, hey, let's put it to the voters and they can't, they don't have the information to make the educated decision.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10213.233s">It's</a> not about trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10214.234s">It's</a> about, they don't have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10216.534s">It's</a> trust, but verify. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10218.754s">I</a> wanna be able to verify. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10220.035s">And</a> I think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10220.975s">You</a> would too.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10230.857s">I</a> am. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10231.257s">Well,</a> we can suspend the rules.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10238.859s">Yeah,</a> if I'm running over my time, then suspend the rules, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10244.481s">So</a> I think we need the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10245.801s">I</a> think we need it published. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10248.382s">Did</a> the city hire a person specifically to figure out how to use the COVID-19 funds?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10256.665s">Okay,</a> but the point is you still spent the money ahead of time for a person to figure out how to spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10262.484s">There's</a> ways that happens in this city to say there's no way.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10271.008s">It</a> doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10271.629s">It's</a> different sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10273.169s">It's</a> a pattern of, it's not the bucket you draw from. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10276.771s">And</a> that's part of the spending problem is there's always been proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10279.753s">Oh,</a> well, there's this match we're going to get for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10282.454s">So</a> we got to do this project now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10284.255s">The</a> library wasn't supposed to cost anything for the taxpayers.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10290.478s">I</a> am.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10294.381s">You</a> have a spending pattern.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10341.955s">So</a> just to clarify, did I just get cut off?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10395.428s">And</a> if I do want to finish my points, I have to come back next week.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10407.737s">Okay,</a> so I'm cut off for the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10409.178s">That's,</a> right Councilor Knight?<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_fy-aPUScOL4/2024-11-18_fy-aPUScOL4.html">City Council 05-31-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1666.629s">Um,</a> comes to Carve yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1668.951s">Thanks</a> for taking the time this morning to address the city.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1678.099s">Um,</a> so for the rest of you, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1680.551s">The</a> parks that we have in this city are awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1682.492s">So</a> I just wanted to start with that really appreciate now they have a small child, especially when it's warm out, you know, we have things like a splash pad that's available to the public as well as a dog park actually exists, you know, behind the Andrews and McGlynn schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1695.72s">If</a> I recall, those though, weren't paid for with city funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1700.843s">Councilor</a> Knight you might actually remember how that was funded.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1712.77s">Sure,</a> but it wasn't solely done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1714.732s">It</a> was like you said, a public partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1716.713s">It</a> might be something you want to look into with the Tufts Park area as well, instead of just maybe temporary fencing, because the dog parks that we have behind there are actually pretty nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1725.118s">They</a> were segregated for like large dogs versus small dogs.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1742.916s">So</a> a general theme, I think that I'm starting to see though, and it sounds apparent that it may be it's happening at Tufts Park as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1749.718s">As</a> you know, the McGlynn schools is, there's kind of some neglect happening in some of our parks, and you know, to the good Councilors point about just in the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1760.72s">If</a> we take care of the city, the city will take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1763.796s">In</a> a sense, right, the townspeople in the city folk will get into it, right, and wanna keep things nice, but if you let it get junky, then people just don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1772.34s">So</a> this Saturday morning, I went with my child to go play on the swings in the park at McGlynn, and there were cases of beer left over, there was a bunch of trash everywhere, there was clothing left over from the middle of the night, so I don't know what was happening with that, but it was adult clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1788.849s">These</a> aren't the things that we should be having, especially at our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1792.685s">I</a> think the administration needs to do something in terms of personnel to start paying attention to your city, because the city cannot afford to keep doing overrides and debt exclusions and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1807.896s">Gas</a> is expensive for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1809.297s">Most</a> of us have to drive to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1811.099s">Everyone's</a> feeling the pinch. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1812.58s">Let's</a> take care of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1814.261s">And</a> if that means maybe spending a little more on personnel to help monitor these places, that might be cheaper in the end, net net, <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1822.487s">right,</a> with all the benefits, everything else that person would be paid versus constantly repairing the good things we have already. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1830.016s">So</a> if that is a person who drives around and looks, you know, throughout the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1835.899s">looks</a> at the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1837.38s">During</a> school, it's one thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1838.882s">I</a> mean, there's teachers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1840.103s">It's</a> the after school hours at those parks, but maybe a Tufts driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1844.367s">And</a> that way, if someone does have their dog off their leash, and they're not supposed to, there's someone with some authority to say, hello, would you please put your dog back on your leash? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1853.175s">Because</a> I don't want my children to be eaten, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1855.697s">Which</a> I know it's an exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1857.679s">However,</a> these are problems that can be reasonably solved with, I think, a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1863.631s">So,</a> but it's more than just the dogs, it's making sure that we're not trashing the city, that we've worked so hard to build some nice things for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1872.136s">So</a> I'd appreciate if, I don't know if that's something that can be made an extra motion or whatnot, you know, to the administration.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2152.113s">I</a> certainly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2153.754s">I</a> guess the only other thing I would add is that if we can at least make sure that those decisions are made consciously, then they can also be held accountable later for those same decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2165.077s">and</a> lack of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2167.799s">So</a> I'd urge you to push for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2169.801s">And</a> the other thing is that, I mean, there was COVID money that was given to this city that is still trying to be figured out how to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2175.886s">And</a> if I recall infrastructure of various types was, you know, is a category that that could be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2184.053s">Now</a> hiring a person to figure out, and their sole job of getting paid is trying to figure out how to spend money and salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2190.578s">I'll</a> do that for you for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2193.232s">There's</a> plenty of things to spend money on in this, you know, like I said, I hope improve our city that we don't need to wait six months or a year seven different committees to act now, or not necessarily act now but at least be judicious, and maybe we can be pound wise, instead of penny wise and pound foolish. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2211.447s">So,</a> but, but I do appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2214.27s">You</a> looking in that and helping fight for so thank you.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2247.175s">That</a> actually, in this particular case, that was a Saturday morning.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2334.536s">I</a> guess one last piece to that is that, you know, maybe if we can stop some of this at the source, I know maybe I'm sounding old school, but I know that if I was like caught littering and whatnot, my parents would drag me out and make me clean it up instead of paying someone else overtime to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2347.719s">I</a> see you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2352.412s">Likewise,</a> but in all seriousness, maybe it is just a patrol, you know, of someone, I understand the police are busy and whatnot, but if they- It's called taking a little pride in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2363.794s">You</a> know, take a lap around and if you see people trashing, you know, if they happen to see people trashing up the place, well then there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2370.415s">However</a> many people there are trashing the place, that's, you know, 12 more volunteers that can be voluntold to, you know, clean up their area that they made a pigsty. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2381.808s">So</a> not everything has to be, we pay to fix other people's problems.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_XqTRewGiIAE/2024-11-19_XqTRewGiIAE.html">City Council 10-12-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6898.983s">Mayor,</a> 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6901.324s">So</a> a lot of you have actually met since 2017 when I moved in here, and there's been a lot of excitement on the corner of my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6906.747s">It's</a> a busy area, understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6908.388s">We</a> now have Wegmans right at the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6910.389s">I</a> had a car crash through my house the first year I came through here, so I kind of understand what it means when there's an emergency that happens, especially in the middle of the night that might wake you up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6918.853s">Literally,</a> the foundation of my house shook, and there was like bricks flying from the house next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6923.616s">I</a> know you work here at Councilor Bears, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6927.528s">Yeah,</a> it was kind of a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6930.75s">I</a> felt bad for the car too, actually, when I saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6933.912s">So</a> that said, I do try to come here and not just complain, but also offer some solutions if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6938.495s">So</a> that's really my goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6940.857s">That</a> said, I'm also now a dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6942.618s">So</a> since I've moved here, some things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6944.699s">I</a> have a 13-month-old son who's actually not feeling well tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6947.441s">So</a> I'm going to go home and probably have to take care of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6951.063s">So</a> definitely some shifting priorities, just like you, Mr. President, in terms of your age, mine also. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6957.067s">So</a> now that I have a newborn, a couple weeks ago, starting on October 20th, I put my kid to bed and around nine o'clock at night, all of a sudden it's like, all right, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6968.694s">And</a> in fact, I wasn't home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6969.855s">My</a> wife put the kid to bed and I went to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6972.796s">I</a> couldn't get in my own driveway because someone decided they were going to dig a hole in front of my house to go fix a gas leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6979.781s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6980.749s">Thank</a> you for fixing gas leaks, especially when they need to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6984.755s">So</a> no gripes with that, especially as it's approaching winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6988.38s">Let's</a> not try to fix gas leaks in the wintertime if we learned anything from the North Andover instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6993.126s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6994.268s">So</a> that said, hey, how long would this take? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6997.782s">No</a> notice whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6999.323s">And</a> I'm not the only resident that was like, oh, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7001.865s">Didn't</a> even know they were necessarily fixing a gas leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7003.766s">It's</a> got the giant national grid truck and they've been poking holes in that intersection for the past four years, chasing gas leaks here, there, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7011.75s">So</a> jackhammer in the middle of the night, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7014.912s">Going</a> through the middle of the night to like three, four in the morning, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7019.692s">So</a> when I came back the next night and said, hi, what's, you know, there's no one really to talk to, and I'm not going to go walk in a construction zone, but there are some nice police officers on both ends where they shut down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7030.021s">And</a> of course, I want to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7031.502s">Where</a> do I put my car so I can get home? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7036.066s">Not</a> very good answers from one officer that asked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7038.688s">Sorry,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7039.349s">You</a> have to go talk to someone and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7042.323s">Well,</a> someone hired you for the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7044.724s">And</a> I know when they have these jobs that they list the details and who can sign up to actually work the road job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7049.887s">So</a> that was kind of a poor answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7051.628s">Didn't</a> really like that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7054.209s">So</a> I tried to do some homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7055.21s">I</a> actually wrote an email eventually to, cause this lasted for like a week, Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7060.793s">And</a> what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7062.093s">We're</a> starting work at nine o'clock and it's wrapping up, you know, three, four in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7065.995s">I'm</a> trying to keep the kid asleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7068.165s">and</a> my neighbors are asking, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7070.367s">None</a> of us have any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7072.368s">So</a> they stopped for the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7073.97s">Oh,</a> they must be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7075.411s">No,</a> they started up Monday morning back at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7077.653s">So</a> that's when I, you know, send an email, asked the chief engineer McGivern, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7084.138s">And</a> the answer I get is, oh, well, I don't approve anything during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7087.841s">You'll</a> have, you know, we'll do some homework, but you know, it's the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7092.265s">Is</a> that chief Buckley? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7093.206s">Is</a> that right?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7094.607s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7095.547s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7097.453s">Finally</a> get a response, oh, this is an emergency, it had to happen at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7102.196s">It's</a> an emergency, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7103.937s">Takes</a> a week to fix an emergency for a gas leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7107.019s">Apparently</a> takes two weeks, because that's how long this thing took. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7110.622s">We</a> couldn't give anyone in the neighborhood any notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7113.784s">Couldn't</a> find a slip in my mailbox, something on my door, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7118.487s">I</a> get those in the mail all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7120.008s">Those</a> work fine, they come great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7122.289s">Nobody</a> could walk around and put something in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7126.066s">Who's</a> the person, the community person from National Grid that we contacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7129.889s">Dan</a> Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7130.87s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7131.431s">So,</a> I spoke with Dan Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7133.032s">He</a> said, oh yeah, apparently, and he was nice, very nice, very cordial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7137.055s">Apparently,</a> there was a failure in communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7139.537s">My</a> point is, this isn't the first time this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7142.099s">In</a> fact, in June of 2019, there was a sewer lining project on Locust Street that someone decided was a good idea to put a, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7150.946s">basically</a> make a giant hissing noise for hours starting at 10 o'clock at night and they said, oh, we didn't realize it was going to make noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7158.631s">There's</a> people that live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7159.812s">There's</a> people that get up in the morning to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7161.913s">They</a> have kids, they have, you know, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7163.854s">And</a> there's a lot of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7166.396s">I</a> think we need to do better, especially communicating if projects are going to happen at night, whether they're emergencies or not, we can put some signs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7174.841s">And</a> the mayor offered a solution that was, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7178.557s">Even</a> if National Grid doesn't, we'll send out a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7182.12s">So</a> I'm going to pick on you for a second, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7184.582s">You</a> have a cell phone?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7186.563s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7187.184s">So</a> you get phone calls on it.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7189.285s">Do</a> you get spam calls on your phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7190.907s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7191.367s">What</a> happens when you get a phone number you don't recognize?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7195.11s">You</a> probably don't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7196.611s">So</a> you think you're going to wind up necessarily hearing the phone call, the robocall? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7201.535s">That's</a> not a good solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7204.183s">And</a> more so is when you go ask for, you know, where's the buck stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7207.705s">Who</a> approved these things at nighttime? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7209.867s">Why</a> do they have to happen in the middle of the night? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7212.549s">I</a> understand traffic can be an inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7214.991s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7216.031s">I</a> drive around here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7217.772s">Traffic's</a> always an inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7221.415s">What's</a> the policy in terms of like, how is that determination made besides it's easy for me to get a detail at night versus during the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7229.36s">Maybe</a> that's part of the calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7230.942s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7232.656s">But</a> I think it would be nice if, you know, maybe this council could take a look at what that logic path is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7240.386s">When</a> we start approving projects at night, didn't it generate some noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7244.37s">And</a> I don't know about you, but I would think it's a person.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7293.794s">Well,</a> apparently, according to the engineer, he doesn't authorize the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7296.256s">The</a> police chief authorizes anything when they open the road at night and they do construction at night.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7351.099s">Well,</a> and especially if it's going to go on, you know, it's supposed to happen a day or two and that like what defines an emergency is a two week project and emergency or is it two week project to project? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7360.429s">And</a> stuff happens.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7402.015s">So</a> in this particular spot, it was one area.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7406.989s">And</a> they would dig and then cover it over for the traffic to go during the day and open it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7412.793s">So</a> you actually have that lost time too, where it takes them a couple hours to open up the same hole and then cover it back over. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7418.317s">And</a> if you total those hours up over two weeks, let's say it's like two hours a day times 10 days, that's 20 hours, almost 24 hours worth of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7427.283s">National</a> grid says they'll work 24 seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7429.684s">So</a> I'm with you Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7431.205s">If</a> this is an emergency, fix it and get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7433.686s">Don't</a> drag this out over two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7435.227s">And</a> a lot of you have heard plenty of complaints of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7437.928s">When</a> you hear the airplanes flying overhead, when they're taking off runway three, three, you drag the FAA in here saying, Hey, it's too loud at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7444.872s">It's</a> waking up my kids, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7446.733s">I</a> challenge you to then deal with someone with a jackhammer outside your house till four in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7454.082s">You</a> want to know some noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7455.642s">In</a> fact, I can, you know, I have DB levels that I was measuring and talking about, you know, a thousand times sound that's, you know, happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7463.364s">It's</a> 30 DB, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7465.505s">When</a> they're wearing hearing protection, operating the equipment, it's not just the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7470.526s">It's</a> not a magical line that sound then up, it only touches the property lines, sound travels. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7476.827s">So</a> that's why I think there's maybe we can look at the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7481.709s">Yes,</a> it was an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7483.79s">But</a> once it starts moving past a couple of days, maybe we're not in emergency territory in terms of how we get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7491.014s">Maybe</a> then we take a look and go, hey, this is getting out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7493.856s">We</a> can't keep dragging this out over two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7495.857s">Let's</a> wrap it up and get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7499.839s">So</a> I guess my ask of you, is there something that we can do, pass a motion to revisit the logic tree of when work is done at night in this city versus during the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7514.268s">I</a> would hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7514.969s">And</a> if not, I think that's a problem too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7517.451s">And</a> if you guys don't know what that is, that's a problem.

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7653.849s">They</a> tried to do that last winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7655.81s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7656.41s">And</a> we said, that's probably not a good idea to play with gas lines in the winter.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7689.845s">And</a> he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7690.286s">And</a> he owned up and said, you know, they could have done a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7693.249s">So</a> totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7696.249s">But,</a> you know, and in terms of coordination, if you're going to rip open the street again, well, don't pave over Riverside Ave anytime soon until they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7703.931s">I</a> mean, it's like a war zone there anyways, but, but at least save some money and not let, you know, pave it over and then rip it up again.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7718.895s">Well,</a> I'll tell you what, if you want to take all the granite curbs and pull them out and give them to the, well, I was going to say they're useless where I am anyways, because there's no curbing left. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7728.646s">That's</a> a whole nother thing that needs to happen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7730.949s">Take</a> the granite curbs, give them to the gentleman that was talking two weeks ago that was saying, Hey, I need some granite curbs because they're useless to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7737.9s">and</a> then fix the street right after they do the National Grid project, but just don't play with our gas in the wintertime when we depend on it for our heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7745.285s">Because</a> God forbid something goes wrong, you're not running gas lines up on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7750.91s">Otherwise,</a> I'm coming to bunk in with one of you and my family so we can stay warm in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7755.153s">So</a> some of you better sign up.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ/2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ.html">City Council 05-11-21</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5418.93s">10</a> minutes for help to arrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5421.809s">And</a> it's just sheer distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5423.13s">It's</a> not because there's, you know, it's a lack of budget, but it's also sheer distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5427.032s">And</a> if someone's on the wrong side of town or the opposite side of town, it's just sheer distance versus time versus how fast can they go down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5435.596s">People</a> in the Eastern Massachusetts area should be very thankful for the fact that they have the resources they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5441.659s">You</a> don't have volunteer fire departments in the greater Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5445.501s">You</a> do up on the North shore, you do in Western Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5448.162s">When</a> I lived in Syracuse, <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5450.573s">I</a> know what it's like to have sheriffs respond because you don't have a local police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5455.654s">And</a> when someone needs your help, it, you know, minutes seem like hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5461.136s">I'm</a> a public servant myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5462.616s">I'm</a> an EMT basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5463.697s">I've</a> been one for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5465.937s">There</a> are probably people, you know, that have been helped trained by me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5470.608s">I</a> just want to say that I would take very much a bit of caution when we start talking about removing funding or reappropriating funding from your public services here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5481.041s">I'm</a> a taxpayer just like everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5484.285s">I</a> want to use money efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5487.052s">and</a> put it in the right spot, but we shouldn't be having knee-jerk reactions because when you want the help, there is nothing that you will want to stand in your way to enable them to come help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5500.357s">So</a> before we say we're going to reappropriate funding and reduce funding, instead, let's try to look at problems that need to be solved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5508.1s">I</a> don't disagree with anyone that's talking about, lack of better term, cleaning up the act when there's bad behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5517.678s">the</a> police that we have here, in my opinion, are already overtaxed to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5523.001s">And</a> when seconds are counting, you're gonna want the help when you can get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5527.924s">So</a> again, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5531.385s">My</a> personal thanks to Medford PD for responding as quickly as they did, being professional as they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5537.909s">And</a> to Councilor Scarpelli's point, I'd actually like to be very much part of that public discussion that occurs, <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5547.034s">the</a> police department and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5549.656s">And</a> also, just a note for Councilor Knight, you can use the dialing number for Zoom and it might be a good alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5558.46s">I</a> know being a person that used it myself a lot for meetings, that's a good alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5562.622s">You</a> can call in on your cell phone and sometimes you have a much more reliable connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5566.945s">You</a> can still keep the video up on internet, but at least you can get your audio through without having a text message. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5571.767s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0/2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0.html">City Council 06-09-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=380.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=380.618s">My</a> name is Nathan Merritt and my address is 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=384.04s">So</a> I'm the adjacent property to the property in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=387.741s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=389.215s">So</a> this is actually the first I've heard the information about what was being there in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=393.617s">Um,</a> while it was a realty office, um, we've been there since April of 14 and we had no issues with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=400.219s">It</a> was conducted the time of the hours, traffic flows, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=404.121s">Um,</a> some of my concerns that I had coming into here, um, I'm assuming that the hours would be similar for operation nine to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=417.783s">10</a> a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=418.384s">to</a> 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=420.005s">okay</a> okay same as them all okay and that said it's actually very difficult to access my own driveway on Riverside Ave due to the nature of the configuration of that intersection so basically the stop line actually is just in front of my driveway so on a daily basis <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=441.777s">My</a> other half, Kim and I, when we try to come home from work, it gets kind of congested during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=447.727s">And</a> it can be pretty hairy just pulling into our own driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=451.013s">So</a> I do have a slight concern, and I don't think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=454.572s">It's</a> nothing on their part whatsoever, but I'm a little interested if there's ever been a traffic study done in there recently, only because people will, no kidding, fly right through that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=464.816s">And</a> there are times when we've almost gotten T-boned trying to come out of the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=469.177s">People</a> just ignore the red light. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=470.417s">They</a> go right through the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=471.498s">So</a> someone else, a customer of his, were to be coming out that same exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=476.099s">It's</a> not a great situation whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=478.041s">I</a> don't think should necessarily hold up what they would like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=481.243s">I'm</a> certainly not opposed to it But it is concern I have just as the neighbor in the area We've already had one car crashed my yard and into the stairs of that building.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=519.141s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=520.682s">I</a> guess I'm just a little concerned that maybe there's something else that could be done to help the people that are entering or exiting through that particular driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=527.547s">Because</a> right now it's actually past the stop line. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=530.388s">It's</a> kind of in this no man's land with the light. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=532.45s">Should</a> you go or should you not when it's red or green? <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=535.031s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=537.248s">So</a> that was a concern of us, just for, in general, we'd rather not have cars crashing right next to our house, if we can help it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=546.872s">And</a> I think, any, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=552.395s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=587.61s">That's</a> the first I've seen of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=589.671s">Please</a> do.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=653.182s">I</a> think it's a business that's probably going to be a little bit more frequent than a real estate office, so maybe even a sign, one sign and a couple arrows would solve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=659.824s">We</a> could do both, arrows and a sign.
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=695.768s">I</a> guess my final question was, is there any estimated impact to the property assessments in the area based on doing this conversion? <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=707.455s">Is</a> my assessment going to go up or down?
 <p>[Nate Merritt]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=714.089s">It'd</a> be nice to know informational-wise, but it's nothing I'm going to be opposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=718.212s">Nothing's</a> a showstopper here.
