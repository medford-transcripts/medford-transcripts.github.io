 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=0.131s">Yeah,</a> I'd be there two hours early.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=400.056s">Hello,</a> and thank you so much for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=401.623s">I</a> want to say thank you to the Medford Democratic Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=404.517s">the</a> Medford Public Schools for welcoming us, and my fellow candidates for being on stage with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=408.62s">I'm</a> a product of Medford Schools, not just as a graduate, but as a school committee member and leader seeking re-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=415.224s">I've</a> seen firsthand both the challenges and opportunities facing our schools, and I reign steadfast in the belief every child deserves an education that unlocks their full potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=424.75s">At</a> a time when public education is under attack, when diversity of every kind is at the highest it's ever been in our classrooms, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=431.875s">And</a> when budget debates threaten the resources our students depend on, we need steady leadership and voices with lived experience on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=440.593s">Medford</a> shaped me, and now, as your school committee member, I work to shape a brighter future for every student, on every path, from classrooms to careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=450.075s">From</a> advocating and securing historic funding through the 2024 overrides, to advancing equity initiatives and capital planning for a new high school as a voting member of your building committee, I'm already fighting to make sure our schools are safe, welcoming, and prepared for the future, but the work is not done just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=466.105s">During</a> university, I studied political science, not just to understand systems, but to change them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=471.849s">My</a> senior research on behavior in the classroom, the adverse effects of implicit bias, and adverse effects of harmful educational practices informed my interest in this work and my conviction that representation truly matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=486.523s">That</a> conviction has impassioned me in my efforts and accomplishments thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=490.727s">I've</a> been able to bring additional resources into our schools through career readiness pathways and youth employment grant programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=497.473s">I've</a> been able to work with our CPAC in the city to establish a best buddies program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=500.856s">We're</a> going to be doing composting to our school district, which I'm incredibly excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=504.982s">I've</a> been able to hire high quality leadership through our different search committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=509.029s">And</a> I'm here to speak to everyone tonight about the opportunities that we have in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=513.417s">I'm</a> excited for the opportunity to speak to you about my personal experiences and how I can better impact the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=518.185s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1615.638s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1617.299s">I</a> think the school committee's primary role is to be the governing body for public education in any municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1624.061s">And</a> I think that it's supposed to be the bridge between what the general population understands about public education and what the government is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1632.523s">We</a> understand that at the state level there's a lot of decisions that are made that reverberate in our local government, in our local cities and communities, but a lot of the time the general public doesn't have the capacity, the time to actually be informed on what's going on because they're busy, they have kids, they're working day to day, and so who's responsible for communicating out to the public what we're trying to accomplish in the classroom and in the school and in the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1658.117s">That's</a> not only the superintendent offices responsibly, but the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1662.278s">We're</a> tasked with not only balancing the budget, but also incorporating the asks and the requests of families, constituents, kinships into the day-to-day operations of the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1673.022s">The</a> superintendent's job is then to make those things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1676.383s">And</a> I think that as a school committee, we can always do more to communicate what we want to see as a general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1683.665s">seeing</a> how we're informing our students, preparing them for post-grad life, making sure we have access to the arts, athletics, extracurriculars that students are excited about, and the superintendent's job is to then hire the proper personnel to task people properly and make sure that that's actually happening in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1700.797s">Was</a> there another portion of that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1702.318s">I</a> think that was all of it.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1710.127s">I</a> think the lasting portion is that school committee is tasked primarily with policy and budgets, like I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1714.931s">I</a> think that we understand what things are happening at the federal and state level, and we then need to communicate that to the superintendent's office, as well as, as I mentioned, to the general public about what types of things need to happen, and how we're going to make them happen through the budgets that we're receiving from the city, and how that, you know, how that will, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1731.064s">I</a> guess disseminate might be the word, but how that actually is going to be appropriated properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1735.067s">And</a> the superintendent's job, I think, is to then make that a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1738.449s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2996.913s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2998.033s">So</a> I want to acknowledge that the teacher contracts that have come before me in my time, I think, is something that is a major point of contention, as you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3005.517s">I</a> think many members of the community who aren't as engaged in the educational platform that's going on in the community were really concerned with what we were doing and how we were impacting teachers, their families, and how that was, I think, impacting student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3017.562s">I</a> think what we are doing right now on this team that I've been interacting with the last two years is really working towards making sure that all staff members feel seen and heard during contract negotiations, are incorporating the questions and concerns from the unions and how that's impacting student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3033.148s">I</a> think when we understand about how to explain it, I think the budget is the biggest question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3040.05s">The</a> budget that is teacher salaries and teacher benefits is one of the biggest components of the school budget, and understanding how every year when we have less and less of a school budget, it's going to impact teachers and contracts firstly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3053.294s">It's</a> not just going to be student learning, but it's going to impact the people that are teaching the material and the curriculum that we want our students to learn every single year, I think it requires a robust <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3063.598s">Contract</a> negotiation team that are actively trying to understand better what types of things need to happen in the meetings, what types of things are changing at the state level, at the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3073.112s">We're</a> advocating for increased budgets every year that's going to properly pay and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3078.98s">are</a> educators, but not just that, but I think also incorporating and creating an environment where teachers are excited to be here, they want to return, we want to make sure we have high teacher retention rates, and I think that comes in those negotiations where they feel seen and heard every single day when we have those communications about what types of things they're seeing in the classroom, because they're boots on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3099.127s">We</a> as the professional staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3102.189s">in</a> the school committee and on the contract negotiation team don't get to see what students are seeing and what teachers are seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3107.217s">So</a> we need to be able to incorporate what they're doing with what we are budgetarily restricted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3111.924s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4381.772s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4384.377s">I</a> find that as a state and as a local city that has the possibility of having federal funding cut, that relies on federal funding for a variety of programs, I think it's representative of the fact that there is fear from the federal government that we are doing what's right, that they're attacking our state and they're attacking our students by trying to cut programming and to be as informed, holistic students and individuals in the general population. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4414.01s">My</a> biggest concern is that how does this reverberate to students who have the most need? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4419.034s">So</a> low income, special needs students, English learners, other demographics that we here in Medford really prioritize and we want to keep in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4429.642s">I</a> know that there is a variety of concern, I think, from the constituents about how we're going to navigate this if we do have federal funding cut and how that additional need will become more apparent with less and less monies available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4446.247s">We</a> talk a lot about as long as we have strong educators and willing students, that's all we really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4451.569s">There's</a> a lot more to it than just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4453.329s">The</a> achievement gap becomes more apparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4455.33s">The</a> student success rates become more apparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4457.352s">Graduation</a> decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4459.134s">Testing</a> scores, as we just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4461.736s">And</a> we don't quite know what that may look like because right now it's theoretical. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4466.821s">And</a> I know that I've been in Zoom meetings and I've interacted with people at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4471.986s">They</a> are actively already trying to navigate what this may look like if we do lose federal funding and even additional state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4480.714s">the</a> governor's office, the attorney general's office, I know state representatives I'm communicative with, I know local cities, superintendents are all trying to navigate what is next, even if it doesn't actually happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4492.081s">How</a> do we incorporate proper educational practices with less and less money? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4496.344s">The</a> biggest fear, of course, is that eventually when you're doing more with less, eventually it just becomes less. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4502.147s">And</a> I think that's where we need to navigate how can we as constituents actually impact student learning if we don't have the financial <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4511.538s">backing</a> that we usually or more commonly have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4514.8s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6142.864s">Thank</a> you everyone again for coming out and hearing us speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6145.428s">I</a> want to thank you to my candidates as well for working with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6149.073s">It's</a> been a really nerve-wracking, I think, night for all of us just because we're so excited about this work and we want to be the best we can be for each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6156.887s">Something</a> I think I noticed that we all talked about was every student, every path, everyone, we all have informed consideration about what is best for this district and we all have to be involved on how to impact students to the best of their abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6171.784s">When</a> I'm talking about a vision for Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6173.646s">where</a> every young person, no matter their background, learning style, or circumstance, has access to an education that is consistent with what they need best, not a one-size-fits-all education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6184.412s">It</a> should prepare them not only for graduation, but life after graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6188.794s">That</a> means celebrating all pathways, college, career, trades, and community service alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6195.378s">As</a> a current member of the school committee, I've seen firsthand how much progress we've made and how much more work remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6201.38s">From</a> building stronger academic supports to playing for a new Medford High, our momentum depends on experience and collaboration within the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6209.263s">The</a> work of governing isn't just theoretical. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6211.524s">It's</a> practical, detailed, and deeply human. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6214.785s">It</a> requires someone who knows how to navigate different cultural understandings, policies, partnerships, and relationships while keeping students' voices and student understanding at the center of every decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6226.231s">But</a> it also requires lived experience, someone who understands what it means to come up through our schools to face inequities and to turn those lessons into advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6235.562s">I</a> bring that perspective every day, being a representative of a growing population of diverse students and student learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6241.366s">Our</a> schools are changing, our city is growing, and we need leadership that reflects in response to the full diversity of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6248.029s">Something</a> I learned during my gap year when I worked for City Year Boston is the spirit of Ubuntu. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6252.851s">I</a> am because we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6254.852s">When</a> we embrace Ubuntu, we recognize that every child's success is tied to our shared responsibility and collective strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6261.414s">Together,</a> we can remind our kids that they are not an afterthought, but the heartbeat of Medford's future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6266.136s">So</a> tonight, I'm asking for your support, not just to continue serving, but to keep building a Medford that lives up to its promise, where every student has every opportunity, every path, for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6276.94s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-10-07_P8rYkRI7D6M/2025-10-07_P8rYkRI7D6M.html">10.06.2026 MSC regular Meeting (In Person)</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5714.812s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5715.793s">I</a> had a quick question about the eligibility in the draft you provided us. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5719.094s">So</a> I know that you mentioned that students that are promoted into the program is conditional based off of their ability to seek the following grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5728.777s">For</a> students that, for example, aren't able to seek the following grade and they need <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5733.601s">repeat</a> a year, does that does that remove their eligibility to reapply to the program as well as how does that impact the I know for eighth grade the very least it's March is when the selection process begins in the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5744.946s">How</a> does that does that impact the rest of the lottery system at all if a student is not determined to be unable to seek the next grade yet but they will be eventually some question makes sense.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5800.506s">Awesome,</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8154.543s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8154.923s">I</a> had two quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8156.904s">So</a> I know that the to comprise the actual tiered system to a prioritization, you know, you implemented a couple different ways to the criteria or metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8166.489s">Is</a> there a metric that we're working on to determine like the actual reduction of incidents and success of this as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8172.646s">whatever</a> that may look like, are we able to kind of implement some type of mid-year report to kind of see how this is progressing so that hopefully we're seeing the numbers continue to go down so that ourselves and the district and I think families understand like why we're doing this.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8340.815s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-09-23_ewRLf8jM8M0/2025-09-23_ewRLf8jM8M0.html">09.22.2025 MSC Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.251s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.611s">I</a> think something that my colleague just mentioned actually both my colleagues mentioned is seeing a need and feeling a need I think you all kind of commented in your own ways that noticing something that you're seeing day to day in your classroom in your school, you know, amongst your peers your friends your teachers, whatever may be, and acknowledging that there's an opportunity here as someone who's witnessing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2654.36s">I</a> have a perspective that I want to communicate out to the people who can make the changes that I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2658.622s">And</a> it's something really important that we don't get the privilege of seeing necessarily because we're not in the classroom each day like you all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2664.264s">So</a> I think maintain that, hold on to the opportunity that you are noticing to say, what can I do as someone who is seeing this need and how can I fill it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2672.927s">And</a> even if that's just coming to a meeting like this, sitting in that student advisory chair and letting us know what you're noticing, what your colleagues or your peers are seeing and how we can best support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2681.79s">So</a> I think just appreciate that you guys are seeing that and you're actually living into that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2685.771s">So</a> thank you.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3313.586s">Awesome,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3398.228s">It's</a> just to clarify, what does the KF stand for?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3422.644s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3423.764s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1220.916s">I</a> don't think they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1222.076s">Some</a> of them are maybe a little hard to find because of some of the names.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1305.547s">So</a> just so you know, this is the spreadsheet that required to fill up the MSBA.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1331.98s">They</a> did have the CT consultants.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1759.653s">of</a> central space in between the addition renovating space today, the first kind of slideshow, trying to incorporate the idea that this is an opportunity for the community to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1769.099s">That's</a> as well as outdoor learning spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1770.94s">We're</a> learning a lot now that there's a huge benefit to having that available space for students and teachers to kind of get outside the classroom from time to time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=1778.444s">So</a> to be able to incorporate that and have that be used as a shared space with the community.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2250.523s">Um,</a> they, in their, in kind of all their designs, they don't clarify what their expectations are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2256.628s">I</a> know that they kind of discuss interdisciplinarity, collaboration, CT, pre-K, innovation sections on what design plans, but they don't actually clarify if they want that to be built in an adjacent building, in the building, what their thinking is with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2269.799s">So</a> it's like, it's a clarity on what their vision would be and how that kind of plays into what we're looking for, which is probably the best prospective program. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2277.625s">So</a> they clarify everything else.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2401.035s">So</a> I think that's one of the designs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2402.596s">We're</a> trying to kind of lay it all at the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2405.678s">But</a> I think this one, I think it would be an exciting opportunity to use multi-level construction builds, either for the additional, like additional renovations or for the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2414.604s">So</a> I think it's a very interesting way to kind of consider what the vision would look like and how we can use multi-level.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2916.266s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2918.127s">As</a> I'm looking at them, so the smaller hill design compared to the other two, the amount of space in there for student learning in general, seems visually smaller than the other two suggestive designs. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2934.694s">So</a> I'm trying to understand where the space is going a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2939.596s">It's</a> the first and second design. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2941.897s">Oh,</a> it's how it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2942.738s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2947.611s">I</a> retract my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=2948.632s">Yeah,</a> they have more stories, too.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3327.067s">of</a> discovery, it's like this growing experiential learning opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3330.89s">So</a> the whole, again, they kind of try to incorporate different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3333.851s">The</a> building kind of rises as you go from the main entrance, the level going to where the teacher's currently sits. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3340.716s">And</a> the whole building's supposed to kind of be this movement throughout the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3344.018s">I</a> think it's a really interesting way to kind of incorporate what we want to accomplish as educators.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3838.173s">We</a> think those vary from project to project, designer to designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3842.795s">Some</a> of the questions seem to be varied. <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=3845.276s">From</a> what I've heard here, I think the questions that are being asked
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4240.179s">sessions,</a> they have desire, you know, it's not working that way, they will have a specific number of ED spots that are just a discussion.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4417.327s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mtlACKVIlfY&t=4476.938s">So</a> I don't think you necessarily need to be on 24, but I wanted to just let everybody know that there was a slight schedule change in the MSBA, so that would be on 24.<h2><a href="../2025-09-08_3V7oKmMkJx0/2025-09-08_3V7oKmMkJx0.html">09.08.2025 MSC Regular Meeting (In Person)</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7222.206s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7223.026s">I</a> was wondering if we would be able to add in the caregiver designation, parent, guardian, responsible to custodian or caregiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7231.249s">Just</a> add that as an additional term, custodial parent or custodian.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7264.09s">In</a> my experience and to your point I think that most of the time it's not being written anywhere in our previous literature I know that that's a term that is being used in other circles and education and just describe other forms of parental guidance in the home or as people custodial parents generally are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7279.699s">biologically</a> related to children, while guardians tend to be court-appointed guardians, there is some separation between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7286.982s">More</a> often than not, one of them is encompassing of the other one, but there are some separations that I think some parents may benefit from having just as an important designation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7294.346s">But</a> if you, in your previous experience, haven't seen the word custodian or custodial parent in the literature, then we may not need to add it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7301.709s">But</a> it's just something that I'm conscious of.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7364.728s">Maybe</a> we don't have to add it in because this is to clean up previous language. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7368.79s">But</a> going forward, maybe there's an important opportunity to kind of consider other guardian, parental, custodial ship in the home or outside and how that impacts families differently and being cognizant of people's personal lived experience in relationship to their children or students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V7oKmMkJx0&t=7386.821s">So</a> I will retract my additive for the time being.<h2><a href="../2025-08-14_R1mdipx9dPE/2025-08-14_R1mdipx9dPE.html">08.13.2025 SC Executive Session</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3692.58s">Okay,</a> so it's just a quick question just so I have it in my brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3695.04s">So</a> for the two new positions being incorporated for the site coordinator responsibilities and the budget, the additional $47,500, have we kind of considered a little bit about how that'll be sustained in future budgets if the external funding changes at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3710.223s">I</a> know that obviously you listed a little bit earlier <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3712.484s">last</a> year's annual calendar listed 200,000 in. <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3717.755s">like</a> in net. <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3718.695s">So</a> have you just kind of thought about that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3720.136s">I'm</a> sure we have.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6033.049s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6034.67s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6035.15s">I</a> want to echo what Member Reinfeld said. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6036.73s">This</a> is very much a similar decision as the one we made back in January in the 27th January meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6045.153s">I</a> think it was 2025-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6047.474s">It</a> was a reaffirmation of an already standing set of expectations in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6052.915s">We're</a> not changing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6054.016s">These</a> things are already instituted, and we want to re-communicate that to the district and the greater community that we as an educational <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6061.378s">you</a> know, center want to reintegrate our commitment to our students and their families and the greater community that we want all people to feel comfortable and included no matter their, you know, regardless of their characteristic or their lived experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6077.599s">These</a> are things that we all believe in, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6080.002s">Speaking</a> as a generalization, I think there's a commitment here, especially from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6084.305s">There</a> are some pieces of rhetoric coming out of that government that are, I think, misaligned from what we as a district have committed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6092.893s">And</a> so that's why we want to put this forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6094.374s">So</a> that's, you know, very much what I think Member Rodfield was trying to get at, and I'm in full agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6098.998s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6435.059s">Say</a> a quick comment about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6436.38s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6437.241s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6438.442s">So</a> this again is very much just reaffirm our commitment as a district to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6442.585s">I</a> think that there has been an increasing set of rhetoric and I would argue even weaponization of diversity, equity, inclusion efforts coming out of the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6453.274s">I</a> think that this, in my opinion, should be <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6456.517s">removed</a> from a political position or ideology. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6460.341s">I</a> think we as people and professionals in this work have a responsibility to our students and their families and the greater community to reaffirm our commitment that we understand that DEI efforts are not used to undermine <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6475.28s">opportunity.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6477.062s">That's</a> what we're hearing is that this is used, these systems and these initiatives are being used to separate people when in reality it's intended to include people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6486.311s">We're</a> using inclusive language. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6488.212s">And</a> so sometimes I think people who are coming from a bad faith perspective argue that inclusivity is removing opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6496.34s">And</a> that's just not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6497.66s">And</a> so I think that that's why we, or myself at the very least, feel like this is a very much recommitment to that work because we understand that this is an opportunity for all students, regardless of lived experience or characteristic, that they have the equal opportunity to be involved in what we offer here at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6513.544s">So,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-02-24_L-37LV9dgxU/2025-02-24_L-37LV9dgxU.html">MSBA Full Meeting - Post Attendance</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3480.638s">Thank</a> you very much, and thank you to the broader city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3483.019s">My</a> name is Aaron Olapade, current school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3486.14s">My</a> address is 105 Brooks Street in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3491.002s">So</a> I just wanted to add a quick comment, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3494.503s">I</a> think that the continued structure of the mayor serving as both the chair and a voting member of the school committee, I believe that there is a clear conflict to a certain degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3509.095s">I</a> think it undermines the committee's ability to function, I think, as an independent governing body. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3512.897s">I</a> think the fundamental role of the school committee is to advocate solely for the educational needs of Medford's children, free from competing municipal interests, budget constraints, or even political considerations for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3525.742s">I</a> think a strong working relationship between the mayor and the school committee is essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3530.964s">to</a> ensure collaboration and alignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3533.907s">I</a> think the dual role of the mayor as both a voting member and the chief executive of the city creates kind of an unavoidable tension between these two responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3544.215s">I</a> think that the mayor's voting power can unduly influence, might be the word, decisions related to the school funding, contract negotiations even, or policy priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3555.825s">areas</a> where the interests of the city government, you know, and the needs of the school district don't automatically align may open up the opportunity for a misalignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3564.847s">I</a> don't, you know, I do recognize the arguments that have been made both in the charter and by members of the larger city as having the mayor continue as the chair in that leadership role. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3577.289s">It</a> was both, as I mentioned, the chief executive of the city and having a legitimate participation in the school's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3583.77s">but</a> having them act as a voting member feels like there's an opportunity for there to be a misalignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3589.391s">So</a> I do believe that there is an opportunity for us to consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3593.132s">The</a> decisions that is made ultimately is up to the greater council right now and I do recognize the amount of work and effort as mentioned previously by a current member in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3603.875s">Multiple</a> years have been put in to make this <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3606.255s">revision</a> revised charter come to light. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3608.577s">And</a> so I'm very proud of them for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3610.358s">And</a> I thank them for their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3611.899s">But</a> I do believe there is an opportunity to reconsider this component of the revision of revised charter so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3617.322s">So</a> those are my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3618.363s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4730.772s">Thank</a> you again, Aaron Olapade, 105 Brook Street, for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4736.135s">So</a> I, like I think many of my school committee colleagues' comments that were just made, I think I'm also conflicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4742.157s">I</a> see the merits for both systems, both an at-large or award-based representation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4748.661s">I</a> think ultimately ward-based representation has its merits for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4754.485s">I</a> think particularly ensuring that all neighborhoods in any given area or city have a direct voice in the governance of a city, school-wise especially in this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4764.793s">I</a> think in many cities and certain communities, you know, those I think in some ways like Medford that have historically underrepresented <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4772.119s">and</a> potentially marginalized communities may struggle to have their concerns heard and at large systems where candidates often come from <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4780.719s">maybe</a> more politically active or maybe more engaged areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4785.022s">I</a> think this structure helps promote like geographical diversity and decision making skills, ensuring that no single part of the city dominates the decision that we are having if you are operating off that system. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4797.37s">That</a> being said, though, I think a war representation sole system for a local school community can create challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4803.213s">and</a> ensuring equitable governance and effective decision making skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4806.758s">I</a> think, as I mentioned, you know, war representation is often designed to give a voice to different neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4812.565s">It</a> can also lead to fragmented approaching when it comes to educational policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4817.451s">Education,</a> as we know, is a citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4819.753s">issue</a> that requires, I think, a unified vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4822.514s">But</a> ward-based representation can encourage, maybe let's call it a more parochial mindset, depending on the conversation that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4829.817s">I</a> think both, as I mentioned, have their merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4833.078s">I</a> think, ultimately, I do believe that the City Council and School Committee should be similar in the way that they're structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4839.22s">And</a> so if the decision is that city council is going to be both wards and at large, I think the school committee should follow in the same manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4847.246s">But</a> ultimately, I think it's the decision of the people and how each system ultimately avails the citizens to the voices that are needed to, I think, impact the students the best way. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4860.776s">So,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-02-11_bHomKoTW3J8/2025-02-11_bHomKoTW3J8.html">OPM Selection Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1285.776s">Member</a> Graham, I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1288.116s">I</a> know we've been in an ongoing discussion with the Curtis Tufts School about implementing what that may look like on the same campus at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=1296.618s">Is</a> this a place where we might put that about the way we envision having that therapeutic program also implemented in the same building?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3618.249s">Member</a> Graham, did you have an idea about the amount of people you wanted to bring in as voting members? <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3625.034s">Or</a> did you want to see how people felt about increasing the number and go from there?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3784.007s">Yeah,</a> I would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3785.508s">I</a> think at least two. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3787.27s">We</a> have, I believe, 15 voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3790.132s">So</a> I don't find that it'll be difficult to find other members who would both be willing and excited about the opportunity, but also have some consideration that might be outside of our perspectives thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3802.335s">I</a> think it's probably best to go back to the larger group and let them also hear this and see what people's perspectives are, because I think the time commitment seems like a large one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bHomKoTW3J8&t=3814.504s">So</a> see how people feel about that as well.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6092.705s">All</a> right, here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6093.445s">So</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6094.825s">I</a> also want to say as a former member of the Bedford rowing team, you know, I also was a middle school rower when I learned and I went through high school, I was elected captain my senior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6103.487s">And</a> for me, it was not only a piece of experience of leadership, but also to be a testament to what this team does and the impact of a true team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6113.849s">I</a> was able to continue on in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6115.449s">And</a> even now I still row now for boat club here in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6118.53s">And</a> I'm here to tell you that this type of program, not only as a team, but as individuals, you learn so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6123.916s">I'm</a> so proud of all of you to be able to do this work and to continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6127.139s">I</a> think the dream of what it means to be a rower. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6128.901s">So</a> congratulations to all of you.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6209.963s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6210.463s">So</a> as the chair of the subcommittee I just like to briefly discuss what we talked about in our meeting before we approve the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6217.369s">So,</a> it was very productive meeting we were able to have our di director, Francis and why Jay come in and work with us in opera and explain to us what she's been doing to support the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6229.137s">We</a> were asked some questions of her and her experience and understanding about what that looks like day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6233.42s">We</a> had a couple insightful pieces that it's a little difficult as the director to determine how often she's being asked to support the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6241.525s">It's</a> case by case it's situational. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6243.606s">She</a> did explain to us and declare that she is not being given any sensitive information about any one student she does not have the legal capacity to do that but <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6252.532s">In</a> most cases, when she is consulted with she's given basic information to be able to give her recommendations or suggestions which we appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6260.997s">Ultimately,</a> we, I think as the as the subcommittee determined that we felt it would be best to continue having her support as needed, but also consider having a new <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6271.904s">position</a> created and personnel come in and act as a director of DEI for the school district separately from her additional consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6279.288s">But</a> we would still have her come in and receive that stipend for her services to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6285.751s">So</a> that was kind of how that subcommittee went. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6287.672s">I</a> think it was very productive and she seemed very elated to be there and to support us in the district in any way she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6294.016s">So</a> I just wanna say thank you to the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6296.917s">And</a> if there's any questions I'm happy to answer before we decide to continue on with the meeting.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6339.874s">Yes,</a> so I think what Michael is saying is that we have to determine if we're going to approve the recommendation that the subcommittee came to, which is to, we're recommending that we create a new position as a DEI lead for the school district while also maintaining the current stipend recommendation we had from the previous meeting from the DEI director for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6366.249s">was</a> the recommendation that we came to.<h2><a href="../2024-11-20_S3LvuQi6-yY/2024-11-20_S3LvuQi6-yY.html">DEI Subcommittee</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=433.36s">and</a> member Olapade. Present. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=434.761s">That's</a> three present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=437.243s">We're</a> good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=439.064s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=439.924s">So</a> I think to start, I'll add some immediate thoughts from the meeting that had us call to this subcommittee meeting, which was some questions and some, I think, clarification about the current practices of leaning on the city's DEI director and how she's been offering her support and expertise on questions about these. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=459.217s">different</a> circumstances and how best we can continue to support the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=463.441s">I</a> think the most immediate question for at least myself was are we preparing other staff for example with these you know these practices and trainings so they can then go into the community and go into the school district community and support when our DEI director from the city side is not available per se as well as are we <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=485.162s">Is</a> there a potential to have another staffer, a date in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=490.378s">Some</a> of the things that also came up was. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=494.219s">The</a> pros in my mind were that there might be broader expertise, having someone on the city side who understands the state's suggestions and mandates and policies and procedures of these practices, who can help implement them in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=506.967s">Are</a> we aligning the school districts, DEI, ADA, crisis management, HR, in trainings? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=514.412s">Are</a> they aligned with the city's mission as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=517.874s">we're</a> resource sharing as well, which I think is incredibly important when we understand how are we implementing them properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=523.275s">The</a> question I think most immediate for me is that, is there a prioritizing of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=531.697s">I</a> think that these issues are incredibly diverse and they are ever changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=534.957s">And</a> so I don't want the city's DEI director to be taken away from her responsibilities day to day if there's opportunity for her to work in tandem with potentially another <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=545.399s">employee</a> on the city side or on the school side who can prioritize that day-to-day and they can work together to make sure things are aligned, whether it's a full-time staffer or maybe a contractor that's meeting on a, let's say, quarterly basis or bi-quarterly basis, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=560.105s">Those</a> are the most immediate questions that I have, and I would ask my colleagues if they have any other considerations they'd like to add before we kind of open it up for further discussion.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=613.912s">Member</a> Ruseau?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=739.053s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=739.954s">I</a> think another moment, I think also the question about availability, I think is a big part of it's something that I think we've run into is making sure that we are as available to the student population and their immediate families and related relations outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=756.548s">Are</a> we supporting them, not just in the most emergent situations but I think outside of most emergent situations and making sure that we're maintaining that relationship after you know potential incidents have occurred or make sure that we're complying long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=768.685s">And</a> again, I think because these issues are ever changing, it feels as though. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=773.151s">having</a> a better understanding about how we are diverting time away from the city side of these initiatives and these trainings that the DEI office is pursuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=782.696s">Are</a> we taking time away from them to pursue those from the city side to this district? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=787.178s">And</a> then is that happening on the other side, the other way around? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=790.16s">And</a> I think that just having a better understanding about how much that's been happening thus far and is that compliant or consistent with our values as a district is also something that I'd like to hear about too, about the time management, <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=801.745s">questions</a> I think we're all having as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=803.527s">So</a> if our director would like to chime in or anyone on the school side that feels like they have some insight would be really appreciated I think.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2946.454s">Member</a> Ruseau, I have something I want to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2948.018s">I</a> know Member Ruseau and Member Reinfeld both put their hands up, so I'll let them. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2951.545s">My</a> hand's down.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3135.062s">Yes,</a> if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3138.41s">comment</a> on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3139.251s">It's</a> something that member Rousseau mentioned that I think you've kind of illustrated for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3142.393s">I</a> think that there's also, let me just go through my notes here so I don't forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3145.795s">So,</a> you know, I think that there is a difficulty in quantifying the actual work that's being done day to day because these instances of need are coming up, you know, as we know, just situationally, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3157.963s">A</a> lot of the time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3158.764s">Of</a> course, there's the citywide want to push these initiatives forward because of the benefit of having them in place and the schools doing the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3166.989s">But</a> when we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3168.91s">one-on-one</a> meetings, HR questions, crisis management, ADA compliance and DEI protocol compliance, those things are very much situational. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3177.118s">And</a> so it's difficult to determine how we are supporting students because they come up as they come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3183.204s">But</a> I think ultimately what you're talking about is a culture shift, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3186.587s">It's</a> not only having someone on the city side or the school side or both that's there to support in all these <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3193.533s">instances</a> and endeavors, but also how are we supporting the staff, the families, everyone involved in the education system here in Medford, and how are we actually making it so that everyone feels more informed about these questions so that we don't automatically need to look to the one person in the department as of, you know, with a city that has a limited amount of money right now, comparatively to Somerville that has 11 people in their office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3216.349s">We</a> don't always have to look directly to the head of the department to say can you please offer your expertise, it's always wished for wanted and we know we're seeing the benefits of having that but I think we want to continue to work towards making sure that as many people in the district are informed about these things so that they feel <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3232.831s">semi-informed</a> or not experts, of course, but they feel like they're as compliant as they can be with their limited understanding so that we're making sure that the culture around Medford and the students is consistent with the state suggestions and what you know as an expert in this field. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3247.221s">So</a> I really want to acknowledge the impact that's having, and I think the intentionality that we want to continue to have for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3256.748s">I</a> think one other question was, and I think that it's been touched upon a little bit, <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3261.909s">When</a> you're going into conversations, both at the school, regarding any of the hats that you're wearing, do you find that there are some stop gaps with the kind of school component of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3275.76s">Because</a> I think that there are some needs of students and families that are a little different than the city side, potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3280.303s">Or</a> you find there are moments where you say, I need a little more time than I may, if it was a city question, because the compliance questions differ with younger people. <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3289.05s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=3298.668s">I</a> mean, more so like meeting with like teachers or other personnel working with students, I should say.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5177.128s">Clarify,</a> so is the suggestion from you members, so I know you're kind of still working on the language to bring back to the larger committee, the suggestion or recommendation that we start the conversation about having a new personnel come into the schools and acting in that role while also continuing the extensive collaboration that we've been seeing thus far for Miss Nwaje and also including the stipend we discussed at the November 4th meeting and continuing that as well.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7291.282s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7292.384s">Um,</a> so taking all all the members and points of privilege and consideration, I think it may be beneficial to kind of have another conversation about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7299.532s">Speak</a> to the director as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7301.374s">See</a> from her perspective so we can hear her understanding about how this will impact both her time with the city side and the time with the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7309.622s">I</a> may suggest that we make a motion, or I make a motion, that Resolution 2024-40 be sent to the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Subcommittee, just so there's a little further review from us and some more consideration from the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7324.671s">And</a> then we may reconvene for the full committee, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7327.152s">I</a> think we have a meeting on the 16th of December, so just give us about a month and some change, just like a subcommittee meeting to further discuss.<h2><a href="../2024-10-29_bQ7rGA39hAo/2024-10-29_bQ7rGA39hAo.html">Special MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2144.935s">Step</a> seven, if you keep going down further.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2468.402s">If</a> I may, it seems like it's reading as if the timeline coordinator will not discipline a party witness or other participating entity if they make a false statement about sex discrimination, or if they felt as though it was, but it was not actually based off of the determining criteria after a review process had occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2489.147s">So</a> there will be no repercussions towards the original respondent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2494.748s">I</a> think is how it reads.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3437.369s">I</a> think another difficulty is trying to, if there are components of things that we want to change without changing like state or federal guidelines and the terminology that they're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3449.735s">So</a> I don't want to do anything that's going outside of what their expectations or recommendations are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3455.378s">So</a> we're not kind of following their requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3459.42s">So</a> that's another difficulty, I think.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2889.273s">So</a> it's not a flushing of the entire water system, it's just specific portions of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2894.535s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2896.423s">And</a> then I guess I actually want to agree with my fellow committee member I think that there should be some explanation about how the actual costs, how we're incurring those costs of the, the yearly or try yearly testing just because I think that there's a way for us to <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2911.938s">afforded</a> if depending what the cost would be to having a more more consistent process just because evidently even though we these buildings were built post the 84 rule about changing the piping that's still an issue evidently so I think there is a way for us to kind of have a conversation about testing more consistently I would like to know how to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2931.802s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-09-24_dAjG9wnL6rU/2024-09-24_dAjG9wnL6rU.html">9.23.2024 - MSC Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2465.216s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2466.137s">And</a> then for the dates and times slide with the six week, four week and various programs, is there a set duration for each program or is it the same for all of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2475.502s">And</a> then it just depended on the total amount.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2500.6s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2501.141s">And</a> then... <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2502.062s">for</a> each student that gets directed towards one program or another, is that based off both the recommendation of the department plus the conjunction with their parental or their custodian, like whoever's working with them day to day in their classroom and their parents?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2551.059s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3240.905s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3241.665s">A</a> question about the students that are entered into this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3244.026s">Is</a> there a process in which we work with them going to the next school year about how to either be more consistent with attendance or about how to kind of work with your teachers after school about making sure that they're not in danger of falling behind their credits just so that understandably that these students were struggling to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3260.051s">Are</a> there ways for us to kind of continue to support them going forward that they may not have had previously?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3318.198s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4928.318s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4929.038s">For</a> the high school enrollment data, is it possible for us, it doesn't have to be, obviously, right this moment, but could we have the Medford High block separate to the Medford High plus the vocational program, just so that we understand how those numbers are changing for the current time? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4943.302s">Is</a> that possible?<h2><a href="../2024-06-25_2sWy59yRtEY/2024-06-25_2sWy59yRtEY.html">06.24.2017 MSC Special Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2713.288s">Thank</a> you very so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2714.83s">So</a> I have some opinions on this as a former member of City Year Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2719.835s">I'm</a> excited to see that the possible partnership does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2722.537s">I</a> think the mission and the goals of City Year as an entity, as an AmeriCorps program is phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2728.904s">I</a> had a great time doing it when I graduated from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2731.746s">I</a> was working in an eighth grade mathematics course in Charlestown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2735.911s">And</a> so I got to work hand-in-hand with educators, the administrative staff of Edwards Middle School, and then City or Boston themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2746.314s">A</a> couple of things for people to know on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2749.175s">One</a> of the really interesting things about how City Year operates is that we receive quite a bit of formal training preceding our time in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2758.177s">And</a> while we're in our program, we're still receiving that training. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2761.899s">We</a> have a lot of one-on-one <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2764.283s">coursework</a> that we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2766.444s">We</a> did about six weeks of training preceding the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2770.565s">Full-time</a> every single day going to work sites, working with your team. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2775.226s">You</a> then are landed in a work site around the greater Boston area and you'll work with your team for the full year depending on your preferences or your ability and your age will determine how you are posted to your workspace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2788.791s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2790.856s">Only</a> college graduates are allowed to work with high school age students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2794.377s">City</a> as an entity usually is from the 3rd grade to the 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2798.119s">We</a> understand through research and a lot of studies that 3rd grade, 8th grade, and 10th grade are the focal points of maturization, and that's where a lot of students find themselves needing to determine if they can continue on with the current coursework that is being given to them by the state or by their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2814.845s">By</a> the third grade, that's when research has determined that if a student is falling behind, hitting certain academic thresholds, they'll never recover. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2823.17s">If</a> they can't continue to find those thresholds, more often than not, it's going to be harder and harder for them to find the missing material and retention that they need to stack up against their peers, which is why City Year has continued to be an entity that's, I think, in over 30 states, probably, and three different continents at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2842.92s">I</a> found a great love for doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2844.422s">It's</a> what got me excited about education in general, was that work right after high school, working as an 18, 19-year-old, working in a classroom with a partner teacher, getting to work with a subsection of the class each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2857.692s">You're</a> in class all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2859.233s">They</a> do a lot of really good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2861.435s">I</a> will say that as we continue to have a conversation about a partnership, I want to make sure that we're conscious about how they're not treated and we shouldn't treat them as full-time teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2871.963s">They</a> don't have the education or the certifications to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2874.846s">I'm</a> not suggesting that that's what's happening here, but it's important that we as a district understand that they are support staff who have done really good work and are there to support our educators and our teachers as much as possible and the community that they'll be working in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2888.86s">But</a> they are not, I don't think that we should treat them as being full-time staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2893.324s">because</a> they don't have the qualifications to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2895.644s">And</a> so as we continue to figure out how we're going to implement a team in one or more schools, I think it's important that we are communicating just religiously with that school about how they'll fit into a classroom day in day, every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2911.988s">Because</a> with my school and how my program worked, I was working with the same teacher every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2916.348s">Some</a> schools need to have different needs, so you might be switching from one teacher to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2920.089s">But</a> my school, the primary focus was one teacher each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2923.271s">Math</a> and English are the two primary focuses of City Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2926.654s">Now</a> that may have changed in the last five years since I did it, but math and English were the two focus subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2931.677s">Social</a> emotional learning was a really big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2934.139s">Teen</a> mentoring was another big part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2936.22s">Outside</a> community programming was another big part of City Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2938.702s">So</a> there's so many benefits this organization has to offer any community, any district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2944.726s">It's</a> really important that we understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2947.128s">They</a> have a mission and a plan as an entity, as an organization, and they, I think, do a good job of trying to fit into what each district is asking of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2957.598s">It's</a> a matter of how do we, I think, utilize their skill set and what they're offering us to the best of that cost to us of that $100,000 at the reduced rate that the superintendent mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2969.486s">So</a> those are just some of the first thoughts that I had about this and I'm excited about the potential of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2973.648s">I</a> just want to make sure we're really careful about how we're implementing them and what that actually looks like for the students especially, but the teachers themselves and that we're not leaning on them too much because that's going to potentially burden the staff in general in a way that we don't want. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2989.477s">It's</a> going to put us in a position where we're not conscious about the lack of <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2994.52s">certified,</a> you know, educated, educate teachers, when we have a support staff who are there to support us the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3002.15s">So</a> thank you for letting me rant for a moment.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3197.387s">Yes,</a> I heard it through a family friend of ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3200.108s">When</a> I was looking at college opportunities, we had the opportunity to attend a City Year sponsored event. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3208.431s">The</a> former executive director, Sandra Lopez-Burke, I believe her name was, was one of the panelists at the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3215.854s">So</a> I was able to speak with her after the event, and she kind of illustrates some of the things that City Year was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3221.897s">And</a> I was a senior at the time, and it really excited me about what they were offering students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3227.338s">You</a> know, in the major city and I thought that it was a really cool opportunity for people who are graduating from high school and college and that that you know gap year period where you kind of had some more time to discern your interest in what you want to pursue, and so I was able to apply and work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3242.714s">in</a> close proximity with her city or Boston's headquarters is the same headquarters building as city or as the entire nonprofit, I still believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3250.941s">And</a> so that was a really cool opportunity for me to be in that space and see, I think people who were super charged about the educational opportunity that they were offering to students and supportive of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3262.191s">And</a> so that was what got me excited and interested in the program originally about five, six years ago.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7516.541s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7519.063s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7901.57s">Yeah,</a> so just a couple quick, you know, just line items that I'm sure will be explained very, I know that the most important thing for I think the committee understand that I'm sure we all do is that just the costs of living have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7913.435s">So</a> a lot of the ways that we need to pay for things have gone up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7916.997s">For</a> example, when we're looking at the special education line item, you know, there's an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7922.253s">I</a> can just find it right here that goes up from the 2023 2024 from 15 million to upwards of 19.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7930.18s">So</a> just things like that where there are those really noticeable increases, I'm assuming it's just because of cost more than any other flagship programming that we're doing or any major differences in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7941.151s">If</a> that's untrue, that might be really good for us to have some more <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7946.215s">direct</a> explanation from the administration about how those programs might be costing us, but if it's just increased because of cost of living, then that's something that I don't necessarily need more clarification on.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1554.997s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1555.277s">Well,</a> so it's something that I said, I think, earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1558.519s">When</a> we were walking around the Bonington building, two things that worked out is to me, just through my experience of it, I think what we were told is that there were multiple areas <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1580.956s">to</a> it because their needs are starting to grow as we start envisioning what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1585.78s">So</a> I think that I feel also comfortable with this as a starting point or as a jumping off point because it doesn't, I don't think it limits us in that we can't continue to grow or consider what the community actually needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1598.23s">I</a> mean, we're only a select few people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1599.771s">There's</a> a community of 60,000 people who all probably have an opinion in some capacity on some program the high school could offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1608.348s">shooting</a> for the stars or really considering what's possible is also difficult because we don't know what's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1614.632s">When</a> we were walking around in Wellington, I mean more than half the tour I was just like in shock at what they had to offer their students, what the faculty were experiencing, what the HFMA or the design firm were offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1627.3s">I</a> think there was so much <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1640.29s">understand</a> what we can do, because it's never happened before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1643.172s">So</a> an idea like a student cafe, we've never had that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1646.215s">I</a> didn't have it here, and I'm sure many of you didn't have a student cafe in the sense of the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1650.198s">And</a> so to even consider what that would look like for our community is something that's never been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1654.562s">So</a> how could you say we want that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1656.723s">Other</a> than hearing we're going to other communities that do have that, which I think is why we should really push to go to other programs that have done MSPA, or it's other programs in general that are offering things that we can't have as of right now, we could consider the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1670.393s">I'm</a> okay with it in its current wording, just as a starting, as a limiting, like it.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2867.747s">So</a> I think, like you mentioned, for example, some of the more specific items, like on the library, the library media space, we're suggesting that CERN ones are more specific than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2880.693s">So</a> are we taking them out? <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2882.374s">Because</a> the previous section of the state of the art, the Performing Arts Facility, we're going to strike Levin, but then we're not going to strike others. <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=2890.738s">I</a> just don't really know if it makes sense to strike CERN ones but not other ones.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11600.015s">Aaron</a> Olapade, 105 Brooke Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11603.236s">Thank</a> you all for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11604.836s">Council</a> President and City Council, thank you and good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11608.237s">As</a> we stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, we as a community are called upon to make a decision that will shape the future of our city and the generations for which we hope to ensure that future. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11616.979s">I</a> speak to you today, not just as an elected official of the Medford School Committee, but more importantly, as a member of this great community we call home. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11623.561s">We</a> all understand that our city is more than just a collection of streets and buildings, is a living, breathing, vibrant community that is a testament to our shared values and the spirit that we as Medfordites embody. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11633.885s">We</a> are facing challenges today that are not new, nor are they easily fixable. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11637.907s">Our</a> schools are struggling to provide the quality education our students deserve, our road and building restoration efforts are hindered, and our essential services are limited in ways that create a sense of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11648.011s">These</a> are not abstract issues, they are real, and they affect each of us in ways that may not be discernible on the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11654.616s">To</a> address these challenges, we must bridge the social and ideological gap and make a collective investment in our future, investment being the operative word. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11662.481s">This</a> is why I'm speaking in favor of the 2.5 prop increase and its current wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11666.184s">I</a> understand that the word tax often carries a heavy burden for many, and it's natural to be concerned or fearful about the financial impact to oneself, one's family, and one's assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11676.451s">But</a> I ask us to all consider what this increase could mean for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11680.322s">It</a> represents our commitment to ensuring that every child in our city has access to top-notch equitable education, our dedication to maintaining our municipal buildings and grounds, and providing aid to our civil service workers and the associate personnel with the resources they need to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11694.155s">A</a> 2.5 increase in property taxes is not just a financial decision, it's a moral one. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11699.18s">It's</a> a testament to our willingness to support one another, <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11701.721s">to</a> lift each other up in times of need and to invest in the common good. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11705.444s">This</a> increase will enable us to fund critical infrastructure projects, support local businesses, and create programs that uplift the most vulnerable among us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11713.289s">We</a> must remember that a city is only as strong as the bonds that unite its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11717.172s">By</a> supporting this tax increase, we are saying that we believe in our city, its people, and ultimately its potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11722.875s">We</a> are affirming that we care deeply about our neighbors, our children, and our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11726.803s">This</a> is a pivotal moment for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11728.803s">Let</a> us choose to be a community that rises to the occasion, that understands the value of solidarity and shared responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11735.104s">Let</a> us be a community that does not shy away from challenges, but faces them head on with courage and compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11740.845s">Together,</a> we can ensure that our city remains a place where our youth can be nurtured, our families supported, our kinships acknowledged, and the opportunities available are limitless. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11749.927s">I</a> ask you to join me in supporting this investment, not just as a financial necessity, but as a statement that our commitment to Medford is rekindled. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11756.65s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-05-30_bv-PbDpiP-8/2024-05-30_bv-PbDpiP-8.html">MHCSBC FInance Suboommittee</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1207.82s">Here's</a> I'm sorry to interject here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1209.901s">Here's</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1211.321s">Has</a> there been some thought at all about <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1214.563s">the</a> moving of one of the middle schools that's in that area and replacing it with the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1219.147s">Because</a> I know that I've spoken to some people in the community, and this is a question on my own, where if you're to have the high school be more centrally located, as we're talking about, let's say, if you were to replace it with the Andrews, let's just say for the moment, you move the Andrews closer to the West Medford area, so you have both an elementary school in the Brooks, and then you have a middle school in the West Medford, slightly more North Medford area, for example, and then you have the, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1242.964s">Kindergarten</a> through high school, you know more central central to South Medford, okay So Would that be I mean, that's not crazy.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1281.922s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1283.242s">I</a> think, I mean, it's not a matter of, oh, we should just <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1287.296s">remove</a> the building is it, is it at all possible to, again, just as because we're just you know praying on Hail Mary's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1294.065s">Could</a> you, could you redo the Andrews for example and make it high school age student and that age appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1303.891s">for</a> example, because I don't want to level the building or start from scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1307.332s">I</a> think you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1307.852s">It's</a> too new of a building to do what you would, in theory, do and start from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1312.412s">But</a> could you use that as a foundation to say, we know how much space we've been using thus far for the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1319.574s">Could</a> we work off of the standing foundation of the Andrews?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1385.307s">Yeah,</a> I think that's partly why I was thinking that McGlynn wouldn't make as much sense because to your point about the two schools, they have a bigger student population and they're having the new playground installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1396.67s">The</a> Andrews, less students, but it's an older, it's an older amount of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1401.611s">The</a> students are a different age grouping. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1403.912s">That</a> wouldn't be, <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1405.772s">that</a> isn't and wouldn't be present if we were to remain, keep the high school, for example, where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1412.435s">So</a> if we were to have the Andrews be closer to the West Bedford area, that would then mean you could have students be able to potentially stay closer to home, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1419.518s">That</a> might not be a big thing we need to worry about right now, but I think the McGlynn might need to stay because of what it offers, even though the space itself is more consistent with what we would need to consider that choice.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10677.324s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10677.744s">I</a> think I just want to echo what our student representatives are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10682.387s">And</a> I think what we're hearing from the community and email and other communications and just passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10688.823s">I</a> said something about this in the previous meeting where how do we weigh the costs of education to student preferences student interests and how we support our students in every aspect of their experience in the classroom and outside the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10701.79s">And</a> I think that what's happening here is that we are all noticing and recognizing that this can't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10706.553s">We</a> can't do it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10707.593s">Our</a> students deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10708.914s">And</a> I hope that we continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10711.315s">advocate</a> for that and work towards finding some way that we can avoid these cuts or in ways when if we do have to have these cuts how we can consolidate properly so that student experience inside out to the classroom is not being affected in any direct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10726.332s">I</a> think what's most important to recognize is that our students here are speaking not only from their personal experience from the experiences of those they are part of their kinship, the people that they're recognizing people that they're seeing as being ones who need to speak for what they believe in, and I can't thank you enough for being here and speaking for your experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10745.73s">I</a> wanted to speak to Jerry if he's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10750.236s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10750.636s">I</a> said two quick questions on the slideshow so on slide five, and I just mentioned before from the previous meeting on May 6, you know, the the bullet points some theater sections will be offered as part of a teaching assignment to align with student interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10765.601s">How</a> are we clarifying or how do we determine student interest because evidently students want these types of programs I understand that this particular point suggests that students are not as interested in the in school, you know theater program necessarily but out of school of course that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10779.685s">Yes,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10821.0s">And</a> then on slide 11, with the guidance Councilor for the FY 25 staffing, according to this, that you're not going to reduce the MHS staffing in any way, but for the McGlynn and the Andrews, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10832.014s">If</a> we just, you know, just do the basic math if you were to reduce the MHS from six to four and then move to those Councilors to the ones that make land one of the interest to maintain those staffing numbers from FY 24 at the middle school levels, I mean at the elementary, you would have a, you know, to 220. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10848.391s">students</a> to one Councilor, and then you would have a 295 to one Councilor at the MHS, which is more consistent with the national averages you're suggesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10856.176s">I</a> don't love using national averages. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10858.718s">I'm</a> sure most of us would not like to, and I understand that we might have to in this unfortunate case, but that seems to be more consistent with that.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10902.903s">And</a> then I think the last comment is kind of piggyback off what I said previously, I think that when we are receiving emails and communications from people in the public and we're seeing parents and students, most primarily saying, how do we advocate for our students when we're not seeing that from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10919.331s">We're</a> not noticing how they're being supported and that's their responsibility and I think it's our responsibility to find ways that we're actually doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10925.354s">And</a> I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10926.855s">At</a> what point does it stop, because I think that member Graham mentioned that if we continue this, the previous meeting when we, if we continue the system of not making decisions that are going to financially support our students, people are going to come here and people are going to stay here and we're seeing that trend, the middle school and high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10942.564s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10944.265s">I</a> don't know how to make the immediate fix and I'm not sure we necessarily have one direct fix and I think cuts is not the way, especially at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10951.394s">And</a> then we have the other amount of money that isn't really being discussed that could be even more cuts potentially and so I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10958.57s">I</a> just don't know what we do if cuts is the only fix, because at what point do we then start cutting programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10965.012s">Because</a> that's not on the table now, but that will become a problem if we continue down this path. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10970.554s">And</a> I understand that you're not the one that created the system that we currently live in financially, but I think that we need to continue figuring out ways to avoid cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10978.917s">I</a> know that our student representative suggested a prop two and a half, and other ways that we can improve our financial situation here at Medford.<h2><a href="../2024-05-16_sV7fY9kw9y0/2024-05-16_sV7fY9kw9y0.html">Behavioral Health & Special Ed SubCommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2449.956s">Um,</a> it's a quick comment and something that I think many of you kind of spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2453.5s">I</a> think it's also a culture thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2455.803s">I</a> think that some students had mentioned that it felt like a punishment and not only the physical separation, but also the way in which I think the, the, the communication about what the program is actually intended for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2466.956s">And</a> I think that that's a thing that takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2470.286s">But</a> that's a top-bottom kind of process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2473.329s">I</a> think we really need to be informing our staff and ourselves about how these types of programs operate, the therapeutic benefits of them, right, and what they're actually intended to accomplish over the year or years that students might be participating in them so that it doesn't feel like it's a negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2491.431s">it</a> just feels like school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2493.192s">And</a> they just learn differently, they just have different needs, and we wanna accommodate them to the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2498.474s">And</a> that comes from us understanding why each student's actually in the program, how we can be better fit to work with them, so they don't feel as though they're being, I think, yeah, penalized for having a different set of needs to learn effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2514.121s">And</a> it's not just the way that they're retaining content, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2516.822s">There's</a> a variety of other things that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2518.903s">are</a> individual to each of them, and I think, you know, I'm pro, I think, having the space be moved closer and closer to the high school as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2528.826s">I</a> do really, I'm really interested on hearing more, I think, from students and faculty about how spaces are really important on smaller cafeterias, smaller spaces that are still in the building, for example, how we can offer <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2543.786s">just</a> less people, for even example, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2545.687s">How</a> does that actually look? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2547.269s">Are</a> those spaces going to always be just for the curse tough students? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2550.691s">Can</a> those be spaces be used by other classrooms or faculty when they're not being used? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2554.935s">How</a> do we allow for all spaces to be used by multiple groups, if need be, so that it doesn't feel like it's separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2562.28s">I</a> think that that was something that I wondered about the Summerville program that we didn't get to really kind of elaborate on is how does their school, how does it integrate into the rest of the building, and is it just for their program, or do other groups use them throughout the school day, and how does that affect, I think, the students' perception about their stake in the school, if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2584.584s">Just</a> something that I'm, as we're continuing talking about, I just thought it was really interesting.

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5854.151s">I'll</a> actually yield my time to our student representative if they have a question briefly.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5968.055s">Thank</a> you and thank you Mister McHugh for being here and being as I think transparent as we've all like you to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5972.7s">I'm</a> only go through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5974.932s">So</a> I, like my colleagues, have a handful of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5977.573s">So</a> on slide 14, the question about special education in district programming that we do, do we have an idea or data on our neighbors and how they deal with in-program versus out-of-city program and what that looks like for us?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6083.652s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6084.332s">And</a> then on slide 18, one of the proposed savings initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6089.955s">When</a> I'm looking at the positions that are being reduced in the McGlynn, Missittuck, and the Roberts, for example, I think what I'm trying to understand is <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6098.499s">When</a> we're analyzing costs and we're comparing it to student and teacher preferences, you mentioned that earlier that you were deciding how we're going to kind of reduce some positions in other vocational arts, science, arts programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6113.751s">What</a> takes priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6114.992s">How</a> do we determine where we need to move money around or where we need to improve our costs, if that makes sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6121.858s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6337.832s">Another</a> follow up question on slide 22 when we're talking about the administrative assistance and consolidation for a handful of those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6346.539s">And</a> member really mentioned this and I'm going to follow up saying when we're deciding how we're going to consolidate rules or how we're going to go through job descriptions for example are we speaking to the people in those positions currently to determine how we're going to consolidate if that's what we need to do or is it more so we're determining that based off of our expectation of what they're already doing and what we believe them to need to be doing.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6385.939s">And</a> I think my.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6432.447s">I</a> think my final comment would be to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6434.907s">I</a> think that the voices of our educators here in the district are central in deciding these big decisions that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6445.19s">And</a> I think that it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6447.526s">It's</a> not that that's not happening, it's not happening enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6450.268s">I</a> think that we have an opportunity here to have a real conversation with each individual that's willing to speak with us as soon as possible, realistically, to decide how we're going to find the money that we need and how we're going to consolidate positions if that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6464.295s">I</a> don't think anyone in here wants to do that, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6467.857s">That</a> being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6470.723s">If</a> we're not talking to them before making assumptions, or we can do at the same time, let's say, I think we're not doing that we're starting we're starting off wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6480.339s">and</a> we're not opening up the conversation, I think properly so I would implore you and the rest of your team and I think the central administration to do that going forward so that when we have the final conversation about the budget and we vote, both as a city council and a school committee that we feel as though we've actually been informed from the people that are going to be filling up these roles and consolidate into them potentially.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6550.319s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6550.98s">And</a> I believe the work that you've been doing, and I believe that you'll continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6554.407s">And</a> I want to say thank you for this, because this has been incredibly informative.<h2><a href="../2024-05-01_A1IveHErhfY/2024-05-01_A1IveHErhfY.html">MSBA Building Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=69.929s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4455.329s">It</a> was a question about the maximum of eight students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4457.21s">Is</a> there an expectation by the organizers that you have to have eight students for a team or is that a decision you two made?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5942.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5942.586s">And</a> thank you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5943.967s">A</a> question, actually, after what Member Branley said about the lottery system. <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5948.609s">For</a> parents that have multiple kids, when they're slotted into the lottery, is that any children they have, or is it just one child, and is it separation between both?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6233.987s">To</a> follow up on that question about staffing, do we have an idea about the percentage of retention rates for our staff compared to other districts that you've talked to?<h2><a href="../2024-02-29_3PnEMQz0yA4/2024-02-29_3PnEMQz0yA4.html">MSC - SPECIAL MEETING - Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) School Building Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=140.424s">The</a> question about the, I guess, overarching overview or like the accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=146.011s">So</a> because we're, we're doing this, this committee, I think with the overall voting power of the building creation, when it comes to actually like hitting these public input and stakeholder feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=157.805s">let's</a> say like thresholds of actual input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=161.347s">Are</a> there ways for us to actually make sure that's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=164.408s">Not</a> to suggest that like the building committee wouldn't be doing that, but more specifically making sure that we're garnering as much input as possible, just because that's a lengthy process that some parents, some community members might not be as able to respond when, you know, let's say a survey goes out immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=178.715s">So</a> are there ways for us to, I think, try to keep us as honest as possible by trying to get as much input as possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=184.197s">That's</a> just something that I've noticed.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=434.994s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=722.594s">Yeah,</a> a quick question when it comes to the non-voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=725.975s">For</a> number three, Chad Fallon is the director of the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=730.297s">Does</a> it not make sense to have him be involved as a voting member as if we believe that the building is going to stay in the same place and be the same composition, but the vocational program is equally involved in that process of what the needs are for that student body?
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2379.386s">This</a> isn't so much a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2380.967s">That</a> is a good point, or I see the suggestion from members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2384.331s">So</a> another thing I'm noticing with this section, section, you know, 0.8, you know, subsection was at six. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2391.739s">The</a> point about requiring an interpreter, I think that we should also be considerate of the fact that this application, is it going to be in other languages or is it only going to be English? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2400.147s">Because</a> I think that that will then <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2402.209s">restricts</a> or limit the amount of people who are going to actually be able to be involved, even at the application phase, because if they may need to require an interpreter, I'm going to wager that their ability to actually read the English language might be limited as well, potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2416.179s">So</a> I think that we should consider, do we want to try to have this translated <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2423.092s">to</a> the most immediate next spoken languages in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2426.914s">Does</a> that matter to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2427.915s">Things</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2429.316s">Just</a> because, you know, if we're gonna have an interpreter and we say we wanna do that, I think that it also should happen, you know.<h2><a href="../2024-02-06_i48LtULfW6M/2024-02-06_i48LtULfW6M.html">2.5.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3220.919s">Yes,</a> thank you so something that memory so mentioned I think is important, or something that I would consider the productive suggestion maybe is that we both have. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3230.273s">I</a> think this advisory committee suggestion, but also having voting members and then inclusion members. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3235.474s">So</a> I think because we want this to be an expedient process, not because we want to ignore communities in the community, ignore communities in the city, but we want to make sure that we're going at the speed that we should be going at so that this process completes in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3249.358s">Is</a> it possible that we do have our building committee that are voting members, and then we also have our advisory groups? <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3255.2s">who</a> are giving us suggestions on certain aspects of the construction or the remodeling, just because I think that, I think member Ruseau is correct that if we want, we want to include as we do parents and students and other members, other stakeholders in the city, if they're not able to attend for a variety of reasons, as we all understand that we're living in the world, it's possible that they can include their voices when applicable, but they're not stalling the voting processes of the building, if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3282.375s">Just</a> a thought.<h2><a href="../2024-01-30_D85kYh8WU6M/2024-01-30_D85kYh8WU6M.html">1.29.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

that to start, I'm a younger candidate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=154.077s">I'm</a> 23. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=155.67s">But</a> I grew up in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=156.61s">I</a> kind of matured, went through the kind of experiences of younger life here in Medford and moved about 10 years ago, 2013. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=162.072s">I</a> started in seventh grade here at the Andrews Middle School, then I went to the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=167.053s">And</a> so I really grew up in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=168.954s">And</a> I think that because of that, it makes me want to see Medford continue evolving into a progressive space for everyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=176.776s">People</a> coming here to work, to live, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=180.037s">feel</a> like they have a space to kind of live into themselves a little bit with themselves and their families. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=184.539s">And</a> I think that's partly what really is the root of my motivation running for school committee to to open up that conversation and allow people to feel like they have that safe space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=195.241s">And,</a> you know, I think also partly what kind of got got me excited about local politics is like the upbringing to my mom kind of instilled in me and my older brother, you know, she's a practicing minister and a faith leader and for her, you know, being of service to other people really is how faith should be done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=214.632s">I</a> would agree that my faith really does inform me and how I make decisions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=219.295s">And</a> I think that that has led me to the school committee and how we as a community, as adults, can give the younger generations the opportunity and the tools that we might not have had to kind of continue improving and progressing our society, but mostly right now our community, of course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=237.587s">Um,</a> I've kind of done a variety of things in the city and the greater Boston area in that pursuit, um, of working with younger folks, um, and just working with people in general, again, to really be of service. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=247.672s">Um,</a> you know, I volunteered a lot in high school at the, at Medford high, you need to graduate with about 60 hours of community service, um, which I think is still very much their practice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=256.097s">And</a> that's, that's not a new, uh, method. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=258.318s">A</a> lot of schools in the area do do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=260.719s">Um,</a> and so, you know, getting 60 hours is, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=262.74s">not</a> a tall, tall task, but it does take a little, a little work, you know, through the four years, especially when you're, you know, 14 to 18, you might not know the different, you know, different types of programs and nonprofits in the area, for example, that offer community service hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=276.065s">And</a> I kind of had a bit of a bit of a, you know, behind the scenes connection with my mom, who just does a lot of that kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=282.367s">So</a> it was a little easier for me to get those 60 hours, freshman year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=286.188s">But</a> then I found so much joy in getting to know people and helping people in any way that I could or any way that felt right to them that I kind of kept doing that and so when I graduated high school I thought, man, this is really good work and I really find myself wanting to do it more and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=302.323s">was</a> so enamored with service work and community engagement that I took gap year from high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=307.688s">Once</a> I graduated, I thought, I want to keep doing this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=309.869s">I</a> want to see what this does. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=311.371s">I</a> applied and I worked for a non-profit in Boston for a full year, working in a school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=317.996s">I</a> was a teacher. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=319.317s">I</a> was a teacher's aide, teaching kids math. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=321.959s">I</a> was seeing what it's like to be a student in the inner city and what that looks like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=326.143s">I</a> went to college and same thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=328.685s">It</a> really was service work, community engagement, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=331.647s">uh,</a> racial justice really were kind of things that I found myself just being drawn to, um, and- and interacting with people who might not be, um, as, uh, able- as able to advocate for themselves as you might hope. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=343.192s">Um,</a> and so I thought that I could be an advocate for them, um, in some situations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=346.433s">So</a> that really was kind of the beginning where it was faith-based action and mission drive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=351.755s">And</a> I think that finding myself just wanting to understand people's experiences more so that I can then inform myself in what I wanna do, if that makes sense.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=418.477s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=419.338s">I</a> think first and foremost, like what happened last year is not new. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=425.242s">I</a> think that it felt like in a really, you know, incredibly scary moment for everyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=429.925s">I</a> think it was no one really knew what to do or where to go or who to look to for answers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=434.948s">Because</a> in some ways we're not trained as adults or as professionals or educators or students to handle things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=441.453s">And</a> so it's hard to not point the finger. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=444.995s">And</a> it's hard to not look for someone's head on a spike because you think to yourself, how can my child or how could my teacher, my educator, whoever it may be, how could they go into school each day and feel safe? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=456.123s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=457.804s">When</a> I was in schools, the issues were still there, but they looked a little different, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=463.049s">You</a> know, we have to be conscious of the fact that we're in a very different world than when I was in high school five years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=468.834s">I</a> mean, post-COVID is an incredibly different life for all of us, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=474.819s">Especially</a> for kids who are really learning themselves for the first time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=479.063s">They're</a> maturing at their own pace, in their own way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=482.804s">And</a> because of that, it's a little harder or greatly harder for younger people to advocate for themselves because they might not have the language, they might not have the ability to, you know, comprehensively discuss what's going on with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=496.346s">They</a> might not even know what's happening for them quite yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=499.447s">And</a> COVID, I think, exacerbated that fact even more so or put us on notice even more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=505.508s">You</a> know, we have to give students the opportunity to work through these questions they're having about themselves and about their peers recurringly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=513.812s">So</a> it can't be a, you know, biannual or a once a month kind of thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=517.634s">It</a> has to be a daily conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=519.975s">Because</a> as we kind of may or may not remember, when we were at that age, we were having those daily questions about who we were, how we identify, who we identify with. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=529.48s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=529.84s">And</a> so, you know, I remember when I was in high school, there was an incident with a with a gun clip that was found. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=536.848s">And</a> that was a really, you know, 2018. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=539.27s">And</a> that was a really big moment for the city where people were recognizing that safety is not always a given. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=546.057s">Right,</a> even in cities where we might have a low crime rate or we feel as though there aren't big incidents like that in the schools or or outwardly right we might not hear about them at the very least. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=555.721s">Safety</a> is not a given all the time, unfortunately, as much as we would hope it to be, and so we need to again open up a conversation, not just with our students with ourselves with each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=565.845s">so</a> that we can start discussing what safety really looks like for the majority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=569.989s">Of</a> course, I'm not disassociated from the fact that whatever I were to do as a school committee member or someone to do in a different position, I can't make everyone happy, unfortunately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=580.538s">That's</a> just the reality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=581.779s">But</a> I think that there is a way to find a form of bipartisan agreement where everyone feels they've been heard at the very least. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=590.006s">That</a> misunderstanding between one another really is, I think, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=592.948s">a</a> root of a majority of the problems that local municipalities are feeling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=597.955s">There's</a> more agreement to be had. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=600.538s">I</a> think that it's a miscommunication or a disagreement on the way to accomplish a set goal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=607.887s">But</a> we all want our kids to be safe, for example, right, we want the younger people, even if you don't have kids, right, we want the younger people in our city to feel safe, like they can go to school, and they're not worried about their safety, whether it's from their peers, from an outside source, and not just physical safety, but emotional safety to intellectual safety, these are real things that we're working through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=627.126s">And</a> again, COVID really changed the change the narrative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=630.869s">And</a> so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=631.83s">None</a> of us know how to navigate this quite yet because none of us have the training, no one's prepared quite, quite, quite yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=638.237s">And</a> so I think acknowledgement that we're in a really, really turning point as a city, right, I think it's the first step. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=645.664s">And</a> so, you know, being a high schooler more recently, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=649.348s">than</a> some maybe some other people on the you know that have run in the past for example I think does give me a lived experience perspective that others might not have not to suggest or leverage the fact that you know because you weren't in high school more recently that you don't have really really useful advice or suggestions or platform to run on but I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=670.404s">representation</a> is crucial, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=672.426s">And</a> so I can at least say that I know what it was like to feel unsafe for a period of time in the school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=679.653s">And</a> it's not necessarily a fault of anyone in particular, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=682.936s">Again,</a> it's this finger pointing phenomenon that happens all the time when something like this happens, but it's acknowledgement that these issues are not new. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=691.004s">They</a> just look a little differently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=692.145s">So</a> I think when I was in high school, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=694.635s">I</a> think every year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=695.916s">Again,</a> I was questioning myself questioning how I fit in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=699.139s">And</a> I think that came out differently, whether I was not focusing on my grades, I was having, you know, problems, maybe with other peers of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=706.705s">I</a> wasn't respecting teachers, like whatever that whatever way that kind of manifested outwardly, I think comes up and I think with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=714.612s">post</a> COVID kind of responses we're having, the kids aren't feeling as safe with themselves and with each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=720.734s">So</a> that comes up a little bit more, um, uh, notably, I guess is probably the best term I would use, you know, given a couple of months ago, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=728.076s">Versus</a> it's happening behind closed doors or it's happening in the homes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=731.857s">You're</a> not hearing about it as much, um, because there was a way to kind of keep a lid on it, you know, if that makes sense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=738.179s">So</a> for me, I really want to, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=741.953s">Again,</a> as I mentioned earlier, open up that conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=744.254s">I</a> wanna give the students first the platform, like a daily platform to discuss what they're working through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=753.8s">And</a> again, it's not gonna be an immediate, well, now that I'm saying on Monday, you can tell me how you're feeling that it's gonna fix everything, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=760.904s">It's</a> gonna be a working experience because again, we understand that younger folks aren't quite there yet sometimes with their ability to articulate what's going on for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=770.69s">But</a> if they don't feel like they have the space to do that, then they're never going to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=774.871s">Not</a> really, at least, or not honestly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=777.572s">So</a> it's up to us as adults to, again, give them the tools, give them the system so that they can feel like they can work through it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=785.694s">So</a> that ideally, or hopefully, in the best case scenario, a situation like that happened five years ago or last year doesn't happen again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=793.335s">And</a> kids feel safe amongst themselves, amongst their own person, and amongst the city that we're in.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=895.633s">Yeah,</a> so I think that, you know, education, um, you know, is, is important, right, of course, and I think that, you know, first and foremost, education looks differently for different people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=905.317s">So</a> it's not just in the classroom or in the, you know, the, in the, the, how we identify education, like in the textbook, in the classroom, lecturing, right, education, it comes up in different ways in different places in the day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=918.222s">You</a> know, when you're a toddler, or a young young child like of course you're you're not going to class really you're learning just from everything you're seeing day to day right and as you get older, then it becomes a little bit more uniform and a little bit more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=929.949s">As</a> we understand by the book right so you're learning a lot of the content that you're being taught by your teacher or by your professor if you decide to go to college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=937.693s">But</a> then we, in some ways, forget that once you leave school, kind of at whatever level that is, your education doesn't stop, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=945.239s">The</a> way you learn isn't stopping. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=946.92s">If</a> anything, it's opening up again because you're not in a controlled space anymore, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=951.964s">There's</a> a lot more opportunity to learn a lot more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=954.806s">And</a> so to be educated, I think, is like the first, is really how you become a more holistic person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=963.733s">And</a> again, it's not just about the four core classes in a language, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=967.336s">There</a> is education and learning that comes from every walk of life, from different cultures, different religions, different perspectives, different sexual identities, different religions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=977.144s">There</a> is learning in all facets of life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=979.406s">And</a> I think that we, as humans, I think naturally want to learn more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=985.111s">And</a> so, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=986.57s">When</a> it comes to why I value education, I think that it goes to what I just mentioned, where to be a holistic person, to be a multifaceted person, I think you have to be conscientious of the fact that education doesn't stop once you stop going to, you know, eight to three school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1004.412s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1005.814s">You</a> know, for some people, as I mentioned, don't want to go to college, or don't feel like that's a need for them they're not they're not that isn't their that isn't their path and that's completely okay, we should, if, for one thing we should be more, you know, supportive of that endeavor because again there are lots of people who find that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1021.771s">post-secondary,</a> you know, higher education, post-secondary education isn't for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1026.197s">But</a> again, those people aren't any lesser or aren't learning still. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1029.421s">They're</a> learning so much, just in a different way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1032.145s">And</a> so we need to acknowledge that education comes differently and people learn differently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1037.872s">And</a> so, for example, something that I really am empowered by, something that I really want to start pushing for, if elected, is comprehensive-based learning initiatives, where it really discusses the importance of equipping students at any age the tools necessary to be a productive member of their own life, of their families, of society. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1059.037s">It's</a> not just about if you can check off a box and get a high score on an exam. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1062.978s">It's</a> about having the skills necessary to live a fully functioning life <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1068.28s">Any,</a> any life you may choose. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1070.502s">But,</a> you know, unfortunately, that's not that's not as easy as I'm suggesting it to be that requires a lot of hard work and a lot of as you kind of mentioned your question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1079.131s">Adults</a> participating in the conversation because they're the ones that make those decisions about the type of education, the type of learning we're giving our students in the, in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1087.999s">So</a> I can think back, again, when I was in high school or even in middle school, where what I was learning, I don't know if I was even cognizant of the fact that I thought I was missing out, for example, on certain perspectives or certain authors or engineers or people who did really groundbreaking work in different of the four core classes, for example. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1109.649s">At</a> that age, you're not really as thoughtful about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1111.95s">Usually,</a> on average, you're not as thoughtful about it because you don't know to ask the question quite yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1116.992s">It's</a> until, for me at least, when I was in college where I started recognizing there are so many stories out there about these types of things that I'm focusing on, you know, regardless of its economic, political science, engineering, medicine, law, whatever the thing I was kind of pursuing at that point in school where I was realizing there are so many stories and so many, you know, iconic people in that industry that I had never heard of before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1139.429s">And</a> I think to myself, well, why is that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1140.63s">They</a> did really groundbreaking work, really life-changing stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1144.753s">But</a> there's stuff that they change really would have been nice to know earlier on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1149.038s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1149.818s">And</a> so I think, you know, if we as adults are capable of considering changing the curricula, right, you know, it doesn't have to be an insane overhaul right out the gate right there can be, you know, step by step changes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1163.873s">right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1164.133s">So</a> we start introducing more, you know, of color authors, for example, in English class, we start considering the possibility of opening up a little bit more historical context to different events that happened throughout our American history or, you know, or a broad history, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1177.159s">Thinking</a> about the types of people that, you know, improve the sciences, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1181.281s">There's</a> opportunities start slowly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1183.402s">It</a> doesn't have to be, again, rapid change is good sometimes, but for some people it's a little too quick. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1188.444s">Right,</a> so we want to again we want to try to include people every walk of life as quickly as much as possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1193.628s">So</a> if there's a way to slowly but but progressively start introducing more educational experiences or more learning into the day to day teaching. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1204.676s">For</a> the students, I think that would really start to give students again that competency based learning right you start giving them more information sooner, so that when they make those decisions about going to college or pursuing a trade or whatever may be post high school, right, they feel like they have a little bit more world experience a little bit more cultural experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1225.614s">just</a> experience is the term really I would say more experience to make decisions for themselves they don't feel as though they're haphazardly deciding things because they feel like they're being told to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1235.668s">I</a> know when I again when I was kind of thinking about college or post high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1240.48s">Most</a> of my friends, I think, would say, I'm kind of going to college or I'm doing this thing because I don't really know what else to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1246.304s">And</a> I feel like that's what my parents want me to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1248.285s">Or</a> that's what society tells me to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1250.346s">And</a> I think that, you know, adults have more experience, right, more often than not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1256.61s">So</a> I think that it's not unreasonable to assume that your parents might supposedly know best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1260.992s">But</a> I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1262.293s">Giving</a> kids some independence earlier isn't a bad thing, right, but you can only really do that if they have all the facts right or they have more facts, and I think that that comes from introducing more education. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1277.615s">or</a> different educational styles and educational pieces over time at younger ages, for example, to give kids that slow independence to feel like they know a little bit more about themselves, about their culture, their identity, about the world, to make decisions a little sooner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1293.872s">Because</a> I know that, you know, a lot of people that I went to college with who graduated with a degree are saying, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1298.236s">I</a> don't really know what I'm going to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1300.337s">And</a> I'm 22, 23 years old with a full degree and a lot of debt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1304.838s">I</a> pursued this subject matter, and I found myself saying, why did I do this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1310.54s">Is</a> it possible, had I had a little bit more experience or had a little bit more independence earlier on, even if that was freshman year, sophomore year of college, or first, second year of a trade, or just a regular 9 to 5 job, would you have been able to make a decision sooner <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1327.086s">to</a> shift what you were doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1328.387s">So</a> you didn't feel so stuck where you were. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1331.348s">But</a> that starts again from education, from learning, from just soaking up what's going on in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1337.29s">In</a> a weird way, let's revert back to infancy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1341.491s">That's</a> what kids do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1342.352s">They</a> take in, they just absorb that information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1345.873s">And</a> why can't we keep doing that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1347.134s">Why</a> can't we give that opportunity and that option to the younger folks? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1351.655s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1362.489s">It's</a> a good question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1365.01s">I</a> was just talking to my mom about this actually. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1366.711s">I</a> think Medford does a lot of things really right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1371.654s">I</a> think that that's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1373.564s">You</a> know, that's kind of what keeps me keep coming to conversation that keeps me invested I think that keeps a lot of people in the community invested is that there are those changes we're seeing I think that there is a want from a lot of people in the community for change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1388.89s">In</a> change at every every level I think we there is a lot of push for like more greenery in the city, more, you know, more city wide events, more, you know, Medford Recreation Department events during the summertime or just during the school year, I think that there's a intentional choice to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1408.096s">discuss</a> the question about diversity, equity, inclusion, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1410.838s">What</a> that looks like, what that looks like for different communities in Medford, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1415.26s">You</a> know, we've had a lot of different nonprofits kind of pop up over the last five, 10 years who are doing really solid work, really intentional work about these questions about inclusion and equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1428.127s">I</a> think the thing that I would say, the blanket statement is that Medford is intentional. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1432.329s">I</a> think that people in the city, not just in the city hall, not just in the office, but people in the community that live in West, North, South Medford, in the center, want to see certain things happen for themselves, for their families, for their children, for the next generation to come after them of a progressive mission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1454.896s">And</a> that comes up differently, as I mentioned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1456.416s">There's</a> so many different... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1458.317s">platforms</a> and issues, not issues, platforms and different types of motivations for different groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1464.182s">And</a> it is intentional work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1465.463s">It's</a> hard work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1466.083s">And</a> it takes time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1467.984s">Again,</a> I've said this a couple of times. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1469.145s">It's</a> not quick fixes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1470.106s">It's</a> not knee-jerk responses to fixing an issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1473.709s">These</a> are, for real, comprehensive change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1477.151s">It</a> will take time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1478.553s">And</a> I think that a lot of people in the city want to see those and are willing to take the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1482.015s">They</a> have the temperament and the patience to see that happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1487.099s">But</a> I will also say that in the same side, I think, again, post COVID has really, I think, the burnout is a little bit is seeping through a little bit in some cases where you're seeing the conversation start to die down a little bit, unfortunately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1499.852s">Or</a> it starts to level, you know, I don't say die down, it's the wrong term, it starts to level out a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1505.997s">just</a> because I think we're all trying to kind of recuperate from the three-year still ongoing blur of what kind of COVID did for us as individuals and as a community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1516.359s">But</a> again that intentionality I think really is what makes Medford special for me as someone who's lived in a couple different places over my life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1523.561s">I</a> mentioned that I'm not a religion from Medford but as a younger person who grew up here that really has kept me wanting to come back here even after graduation is to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1533.263s">set</a> roots here and call this place my home, so.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1561.88s">That's</a> a good question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1562.561s">It's</a> not something that's, it's obvious about my appearance, I would say, but I'm a very organized person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1572.689s">It's</a> like not really, you know, anything crazy or super cool, but I'm a very space picky guy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1578.534s">So</a> I like, I like, especially my own personal spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1582.757s">I</a> like things very uniform just because it gives me, you know, a sense of some semblance of control. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1589.082s">uh,</a> not to suggest I'm a control freak, definitely not that, but I think that with how life kind of comes at us both fast and slow day to day, I think having certain, um, things feel very, uh, controlled, I think really grounds me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1604.535s">And</a> so like I do, I have a very set structure to my day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1608.338s">I</a> do the same thing every morning and I've been doing it kind of for the last four years of college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1614.663s">I</a> will, you know, I'll get up in the morning, I'll make my bed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1617.606s">That's</a> the first thing I do pretty much just because, you know, there was an army general, I think, who had this really famous graduation speech years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1626.893s">And</a> he talked about the importance of making your bed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1629.675s">And</a> I watched it probably when I was like 14. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1631.656s">I</a> was like, oh, that's super, that's super on point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1633.718s">I'm</a> gonna start making my bed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1635.199s">So</a> I make my bed every morning, you know, and the motive or the moral of that general speech, I think, was if you've had the worst day ever, right, nothing went the way you thought it would, you know, you at least accomplished one thing, which was making your bed, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1650.068s">So</a> these little accomplishments really are, they start to stack up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1655.232s">And</a> so, you know, I think that, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1657.725s">Again,</a> you know that uniformness of things that I have control over does ground me in the type of work that I want to do that isn't as controllable or isn't quick. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1666.833s">So</a> I think, you know, I really like setting things up a certain way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1669.856s">So</a> I make my bed every morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1671.237s">I</a> go, I was a collegiate rower. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1674.768s">uh,</a> in, in college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1675.669s">So</a> I, I, I wrote crew and I still do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1677.911s">So</a> every morning I will make my bed and then I'll go row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1681.434s">And</a> I do that pretty much every day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1682.615s">If</a> I can help myself, I'll make my bed no matter what I do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1685.438s">I</a> can row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1685.898s">If</a> I can get in the morning, I'll go do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1687.48s">And</a> that again, sets me up and get the physical activity out of the way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1691.203s">It</a> catches me just in a, in a, in a productive mood because I do this really early. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1695.687s">I</a> do this at about five 30 in the morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1698.029s">because</a> I had to do that for school and I still do it now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1700.614s">So</a> I think that that's probably something you wouldn't know is like really early and I make my bed and I row and that's what sets me up for the rest of my day.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1718.136s">I</a> did, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1718.777s">So</a> Medford High, surprisingly, had a rowing team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1722.561s">They</a> still do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1723.602s">And</a> I started freshman year, or I technically started in middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1729.388s">Um,</a> my brother, uh, went to college and he had a couple of buddies that were on the rowing team at his school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1734.352s">And</a> he, when we moved to Medford, when we were looking to Medford rec department, trying to find like camp to do, my mom was like, Oh, you would row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1741.636s">That'd</a> be a great thing to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1742.777s">And</a> when I was, you know, in the middle school, I was a smaller, more lengthy, uh, lengthy guy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1747.34s">So</a> it didn't really fit in my brain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1749.662s">I</a> also didn't know anything about it, but my brother thought, you know, that's a great physical activity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1753.224s">You'll</a> get in great shape. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1754.064s">You</a> should do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1755.205s">And</a> I, uh, I did it and it was the worst thing ever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1757.826s">And</a> I didn't want to do it anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1758.847s">And</a> I stuck, I maintained that opinion for like three years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1763.209s">I</a> just was like, this is the worst activity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1764.67s">I</a> don't want to do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1765.53s">I'd</a> rather do anything else. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1767.932s">And</a> it wasn't until probably sophomore year of high school where I thought, you know, this is a really cool activity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1772.534s">It's</a> a really cool sport. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1774.455s">Um,</a> and I think it was more acceptance that I can't do any other sport more than actual want to row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1780.858s">It</a> was kind of like a, if you can't get out of it, get into it type mentality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1785.0s">And</a> I think that I just was like, you know what, I was able to keep it going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1788.383s">I'm</a> kind of good at it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1789.304s">I'm</a> taller now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1790.545s">It</a> kind of works out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1791.866s">And</a> I did it through high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1793.088s">And</a> I thought, all right, I'm not that bad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1795.35s">And</a> then I kept doing it in college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1796.811s">And</a> yeah, I was a captain, both high school and college, which was really, you know, I felt really proud of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1802.376s">And</a> that was really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1803.297s">And</a> it just, yeah, again, it really does. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1807.761s">It</a> grounds you because it's a rowing is a very team oriented sport almost entirely team oriented. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1812.806s">And</a> so I think that for me it's informed a lot of the decisions I've made in my life or the mentalities I have going into different opportunities is what I would call them with other people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1824.316s">is</a> that teamwork makes the dream work in a bit of a cliche way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1828.877s">If</a> you want to win a race or you want to be productive in the competitive season, you have to kind of get past yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1834.719s">You</a> have to get out of your own way and acknowledge that there might be a person in the boat with you who's faster than you, speed-wise, or has more technical capacity than you do, or someone who you may feel, though, is a little behind you in those <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1850.803s">you</a> know, those, uh, ways of gauging your overall rowing success, you still need to lead them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1856.784s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1857.184s">And</a> so I think that, you know, very much like setting up those little perspective changes is how I kind of keep going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1863.585s">So</a> waking up really early feels like a thing I don't need to do anymore because like, I'm not in school anymore and I don't have anywhere I need to be at, you know, 8 00 AM for school, but you know, I did it all through high school and it worked out for me and I felt like I was really productive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1876.788s">So</a> if I wake up at five, five 30, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1878.815s">and</a> I make my bed and I get out on the river and I do that for an hour and a half. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1882.697s">I</a> feel like if it isn't broke, again, another cliche, don't fix it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1886.279s">So,</a> you know, that's kind of, that's, that's part of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1889.721s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1896.024s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1905.262s">Yeah,</a> so I think there's a couple things that I would say about myself that I think would be good to kind of give some people some more understanding about me is that, you know, as I mentioned, like I've been doing this for a long time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1917.549s">So,</a> first and foremost, I think that at any age, you can be involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1921.652s">I</a> don't think you're too young or too old. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1924.734s">Any,</a> any age offers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1927.215s">you</a> know, you have the opportunity to be locally engaged, communally engaged, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1932.378s">It</a> doesn't need to be in politics, it can be in different types of work, different types of non-profit stuff, different types of aid work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1938.102s">Those</a> are all things that you can participate in if there's a want to, slash I think you should. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1943.145s">I</a> think that that's something that I really, you know, goes back to kind of my mom's upbringing that like being of service to other people really is a fulfilling endeavor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1950.95s">Whether</a> it's from a faith religious perspective like it is for me or from another perspective of just like an ethical ethical moral kind of belief system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1960.417s">So,</a> you know, you know, first and foremost, really understand that being of service to people being service to the community really is an enriching experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1969.544s">As</a> an individual really helps you put into perspective, the world around you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1975.511s">And</a> partly for me I kept finding myself in opportunities where that was my, that was how I felt you know I, I was named the youth coordinator. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1985.382s">for</a> the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP, and I still do do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=1990.245s">I</a> still act in that role, and I've been doing that for a little over two years now, and so it's my job to reach out to the youth of the Mystic Valley branch, right, not just of Medford, but the surrounding cities, to see how our youth are changing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2003.412s">You</a> know, you mentioned earlier a question about how has Medford shifted a little bit, or do I feel as though what happened last year, is that similar to what I was seeing when I was in high school five years ago, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2012.817s">same</a> kind of questions is the way we were as a youth, you know, 510 1520 years ago however long ago is that in any way different than the kids that are going to schools to this day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2023.96s">And</a> again it's the answer is yes and no. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2026.601s">I</a> think, yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2029.622s">Yes,</a> and that it's a different world we live in now not just post coded but just in general tech technology advancements medical advancements cultural differences. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2038.03s">The</a> integration of different different religions like these are all things that are in there's more of this we're seeing in Massachusetts or in America, for example. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2046.937s">But</a> that being said, though, there are a lot of the same problems a lot of the same things we're seeing 510 15 years ago that we're still seeing today, a lack of communication, a miss mismanagement of schools, a lack of respect towards one another because we might be different supposedly different again right we might <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2065.78s">supposedly,</a> you know, normative, right, whatever, whatever you want to suggest about being someone who might not identify with the supposed status quo causes a misunderstanding of one another that creates discrimination, segregation, racism, bigotry, right, whatever that may be, or a dislike of someone at the most basic level, you know, when you're like in kindergarten, right, because they might not look like you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2088.636s">And</a> so when I outreach to the youth as an NWCP member and as a youth coordinator, that really is something I run into a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2095.682s">We're</a> seeing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2096.503s">That's</a> still going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2097.544s">I</a> think it's hard to hear stories from students and from young people about how to navigate that, those issues that they're having, those things that they're working through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2106.872s">especially</a> when they don't know if they have someone to go speak to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2110.313s">They</a> don't have representation in schools, for example, or in their city council school committee, mayor's office, whatever adult position that they look to for support, and they're not sure who to talk to about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2123.316s">I</a> think I found myself so enamored with working with the young folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2128.977s">I</a> kept wanting to do it more and more, and that's really, again, another thing that led to the school committee decision of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2134.598s">to</a> run for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2135.318s">I</a> thought there's such an opportunity for me as someone who is who is motivated by these things and who wants to work with the youth and want to understand them better and then be able to be an advocate for them to the greater area to really enact that change and again be a service to a cause like you know greater than myself as much as I can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2155.364s">You</a> know I so I've done that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2157.544s">I</a> really pursued more engagement in the local Medford community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2161.925s">I</a> was a community liaison <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2164.406s">for</a> the Medford Health Department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2165.587s">I</a> did that for over a year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2167.529s">The</a> department was given a grant to fund outreach of five liaisons of different cultural communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2176.197s">I</a> was African-American and Black community liaison. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2178.519s">We</a> had an Arabic liaison, a Haitian Creole speaking Haitian community liaison. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2185.224s">Different</a> individuals that were Medford residents, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2189.177s">who</a> wanted to be part of the conversation, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2192.238s">So</a> in that endeavor, it was the same kind of thing, just for an older demographic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2195.3s">How</a> do these different communities, these different demographics in the city feel about what's going on? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2201.063s">Or</a> do they know what's going on? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2203.124s">And</a> I found that the answer was, no, they don't, for the most part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2206.305s">And</a> that's a swooping statement, of course, but I thought a majority of the people that I was running into don't know or don't know where to go to find this information, really. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2214.389s">So</a> there's, again, a lack of information <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2217.572s">Um,</a> or language barrier is a big thing, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2219.534s">A</a> lot of people don't speak English as a first language. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2221.757s">So</a> even if they are wanting to be involved in the community or have their kids be involved, the language barrier is a big problem, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2228.684s">So</a> even the speech, the language being used on the websites, for example, is a big, a big blockade for a lot of people, you know, they're like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2235.291s">understand</a> what's going on, but I can't read what's going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2237.593s">So</a> I don't know how to, I don't know who to talk to about it, because there might not be a translator in the City Hall's department, or there might not be someone who understands what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2245.161s">My</a> accent might be a little stronger than they're able to handle, or I might not have the language as someone who's been speaking English as a first language to articulate what I'm trying to understand is going on with like town hall meetings or different community events or whatever it may be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2259.014s">So</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2260.235s">For</a> me, I've kind of recurrently found myself pursuing different opportunities in the city and the greater area to understand people better first. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2271.604s">To</a> understand people better, that's really then when you get the opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2275.567s">Again,</a> these are all opportunities, how I'm mining them in my brain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2279.99s">You</a> get this opportunity to then advocate for people differently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2283.693s">But</a> again, that didn't happen for me quickly, and it took time for me to kind of be able to acknowledge that that's where I was going with my life, and I wanted to pursue that wholeheartedly for my career, is being of service. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2295.422s">And</a> I think that the school committee offers me that opportunity to be an advocate and a voice for people who, again, who might not have the language quite yet, or feel like they have the platform or the space to do that for themselves yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2309.734s">That's</a> probably the best way I can say that of the things that I've done that I'm still doing, or things that I've done in the past, I think have informed where I'm at right now.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2329.953s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2332.094s">Yes,</a> so I have a kickoff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2334.055s">It's</a> a dual kickoff with another fellow new coming school committee candidate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2341.758s">Her</a> name was Erica Reinfeld, and we are both OR, Our Revolution Endorsed Candidates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2348.021s">And</a> we thought that having a dual kickoff felt like a really great way to get both our names out there even more, to meet each other's bases and just people in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2357.367s">And</a> in a two birds, one stone kind of setup, it felt like that was the right thing to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2364.351s">And</a> so we agree on a lot of different platforms, that OR as a nonprofit kind of push forward for the Medford community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2371.996s">And</a> we are really in this together as progressive candidates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2376.859s">So</a> that's on August 28th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OKuuJDk3xLpRXgTHJQzYl?t=2379.922s">So</a> about, I think, 17 days from today, it is a...

Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2702.887s">I</a> live on 105 Brooke Street.
 <p>[Aaron Olapade]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2704.929s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2705.289s">Stand</a> tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2706.25s">So</a> I totally understand what you're saying about like how you think that Medford is like a great place and how we are doing what we're supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2712.374s">I</a> think so because I came from a place where I didn't really think that and I thought that we were very undiverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2717.438s">And</a> so me coming here when I was, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2719.842s">I</a> think 13, it was kind of interesting because I was so surprised at how diverse I felt. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2725.205s">But</a> it isn't a matter of how much we're doing, it's a matter of how much we can do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2729.887s">So</a> I think that because we might, let's say we're doing 80%, I think we can do 90%, 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2734.63s">I</a> think we can do so much more that it will be like a model for other towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2740.833s">So</a> I think that, I don't understand exactly what's happening, meaning I don't understand what a resolute is, but I do know <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2747.277s">I</a> kind of get it, but I do know that it is something that's really important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2750.539s">It's</a> important to a lot of kids in my school and it's important to my mom and other adults in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2755.103s">So</a> I think that it might not be, you know, it might not be as important as some people will believe, but I think it's important to a lot of other people.
