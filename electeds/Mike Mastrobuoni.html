    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9732.413s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Good evening, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9733.153s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Mike Mastroboni, 73 Fulton Spring Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9736.514s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I'll be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9738.215s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think either proposal moving to ward or district-based representation is a positive move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9745.537s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think for a couple of reasons, one, lowering the barrier to entry for people trying to campaign in terms of cost, in terms of effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9754.74s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think secondly, having a representative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9761.088s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: That you can go to on a local basis, I think, for me pushes me towards the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9768.505s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: eight individual board Councilors approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9772.688s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I respect the immense amount of work that the Charter Review Committee did over a number of years, the level of effort they did in reaching out to as many residents as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9783.075s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: And the last thing I'll say, this isn't really my area of expertise, but I think looking retrospectively at turnout numbers and voting numbers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9791.4s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think it's a bit of a red herring, you know, when people are able to when people running for office are able to focus on individual wards, you know, different wards have different ways of outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9805.222s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: and people be able to meet people where they are in a way that makes sense, whether it's tough students or folks in apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9811.425s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: We're gonna be having a lot more big apartment buildings coming in the city, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9814.466s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: That's a challenge that everybody will have to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9819.148s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: So I think for that reason, I support word-based city councilors, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9827.291s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I appreciate the work everyone's done on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9829.052s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=54.692s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Melvin, Laurel, there's a bunch of, there's like an iPhone user, a cell phone user.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=59.176s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Let me know what you want me to just submit everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=73.507s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Here's John, I just let him in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=76.469s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: So it looks like then everybody else is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=78.471s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Okay, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4036.419s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Thank you, uh, no, but thank you, Anthony, Michael, and Marilyn for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4041.023s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Um, we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4041.904s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think I speak for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4042.744s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I say that, um, I'm the, uh, by day I'm the budget director in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4047.768s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: So this is a process, um, uh, about which I am a little bit familiar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4052.272s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I've been involved in the charter review, especially with respect to the, the CIP and the sort of the role of finance and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4060.119s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4061.508s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I'm relatively, you know, compared to the rest of the group, probably I'm very new to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4067.329s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: So what's important to me as a newer resident here, at least in this process, specifically kind of like, you know, what extent do we want to hear from the mayor, from the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4080.973s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Can we hear from the mayor and the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4083.392s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: or are we simply negotiating with ourselves to find out sort of what can or cannot pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4088.775s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think I come at this from obviously like an administrative good governance bias, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4095.658s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Just because of my day job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4097.499s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: And I wanna find out what relevant comparisons in terms of size, scope of government there are between like Medford and the surrounding communities I'm not interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4112.211s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: In reinventing the wheel here, there's best practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4114.772s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: We're not the first ones to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4117.414s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: So trying to figure out what's worked in other places and what have been pain points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4122.996s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: And then really trying to strike the middle ground between flexibility and creating strong guardrails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4132.301s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: I think at the end of the day, well, I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5648.69s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Yeah, just just really briefly, I'm wondering what our ongoing engagement with the call center looks like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5653.995s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Is there we are we going to have presentations on specific topics from them on our regular meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5660.52s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Or are they going to be advising us answering questions that we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5664.183s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Like, what does that look like?<br><br>
