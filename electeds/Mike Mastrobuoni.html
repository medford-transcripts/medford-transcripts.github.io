<h2><a href="../2025-10-20_fr7q6GxmdPE/2025-10-20_fr7q6GxmdPE.html">2025 Candidate Profile - School Committee - Michael A Mastrobuoni</a></h2>
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=5.768s">Hello,</a> my name is Michael Mastromoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=8.189s">I'm</a> a parent of two, a public servant, and I'm running for the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=13.292s">My</a> family and I love Medford because it's a community that values public schools, civic life, and neighbors who look out for one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=20.016s">My</a> seven-year-old son, Lincoln, and my four-year-old daughter, Violet, are both Robert's school kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=24.619s">My</a> wife and I have built friendships here with families and educators who care deeply about Medford's future, and that's so energizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=31.914s">Running</a> for school committee is my way of giving back to a community that's given so much to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=37.098s">Professionally,</a> I serve as the budget director for the city of Somerville, where I help develop and manage a $400 million annual budget and lead our long-term financial strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=46.084s">My</a> job is to make sure public dollars serve the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=49.467s">That</a> means protecting resources and core programs, connecting spending with community priorities, and keeping services strong no matter what's happening at the state or federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=58.998s">I</a> was also part of the finance team that delivered a new Somerville High School in 2021, from early planning through construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=65.6s">I</a> know what it takes to manage a once-in-a-generation investment like that, balancing fiscal responsibility with the real needs of students and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=73.723s">My</a> experience will help Medford as we move forward with our own high school reconstruction, an enormous opportunity to build something lasting and community-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=82.567s">But</a> my 20-year local government career isn't just about numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=85.808s">It's</a> about communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=87.389s">In</a> my role, I take complex financial decisions and make them clear and accessible so residents understand not just what we're doing, but why. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=95.151s">It's</a> the kind of honest communication we'll need here in Medford as we make big decisions about budgets, programs, and that high school project. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=102.643s">Leading</a> our school district requires planning, consistency, and follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=107.044s">And</a> that's what I do best. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=108.345s">The</a> school committee is not just a policy group. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=110.386s">It's</a> an executive body. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=111.766s">It</a> hires and evaluates the superintendent, ensures the district's budget reflects our values, and sets measurable goals through strategic planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=118.948s">I'm</a> ready to do that work on day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=121.729s">I</a> bring experience, leadership, and a steady hand to preserve what works and invest in what needs improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=128.513s">If</a> I'm elected, I'll focus on three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=131.094s">First,</a> supporting our school through strong curriculum, special education, athletics, and afterschool programs that give every student a place to belong and a chance to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=141.078s">Second,</a> budgeting for values and stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=143.579s">That</a> means making sure our spending is transparent, sustainable, and focused on what matters most. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=148.701s">Third,</a> delivering a successful Medford High School project, a school we can be proud of that's fiscally responsible and built to meet the needs of today's students, their children, and generations to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=159.867s">I</a> believe in collaboration, not confrontation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=162.369s">I</a> believe in clear communication and honest explanations, especially when decisions get complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=168.253s">I've</a> spent my career helping folks understand how government works and how to make it work better for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=173.296s">I'm</a> proud to be a parent and a public servant here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=177.579s">Medford</a> deserves a school committee that's focused, informed, and grounded in values. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=182.062s">A</a> team that can plan for the future while protecting what makes our school special today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=186.125s">I'd</a> be honored to earn your vote on Tuesday, November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=188.886s">Thank</a> you for listening, and thank you so much for caring about our public schools.<h2><a href="../2025-10-16_ntWR6BrwZ7g/2025-10-16_ntWR6BrwZ7g.html">2025 Candidates Forum - School Committee - Candidates Forum - Caron

 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=262.177s">Can</a> everybody hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=263.358s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=263.558s">Thanks</a> so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=265.559s">Good</a> evening and thank you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=267.481s">I'm</a> Michael Mastrobone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=269.202s">I'm</a> a parent of two MPS kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=272.105s">I'm</a> a public servant and obviously I'm running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=275.899s">My</a> family moved to Medford because it reflects the values that we try to live by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=280.34s">Strong</a> public school system, a community that believes in showing up for one another, and an active civic spirit that you can feel at block parties and PTO meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=288.201s">And</a> of course, we also moved here for the Fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=291.702s">Since</a> moving here, Medford has welcomed my wife and me along with our seven-year-old Lincoln and our four-year-old Violet, both Roberts kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=298.063s">Running</a> for school committee is my way of giving back to the community that's given us so, so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=303.384s">In</a> my professional life, I serve as budget director for the City of Somerville, where I manage large, complex budgets and long-term capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=310.892s">My</a> job is to make sure public dollars serve the public, protecting core services, aligning spending with community priorities, and keeping programs strong no matter what comes our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=319.821s">That</a> includes the federal government and the state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=323.258s">That</a> experience that I have in my everyday life matters here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=326.159s">I</a> was part of the finance team that delivered Somerville's new high school project in 2021 from early planning through construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=332.02s">I'm</a> really proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=333.46s">I</a> know what it takes to support a school building project that meets student needs while staying fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=340.202s">And</a> I know how important transparency and communication are when you're spending public dollars on something that's gonna shape a community for generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=347.324s">I've</a> spent my career protecting local resources, planning for the longterm, and keeping vital programs strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=353.582s">The</a> school committee, it's not just a policy group, it's an executive body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=356.608s">It</a> hires and evaluates the superintendent, it ensures the district budget reflects our values, and it sets measurable goals and holds us accountable for meeting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=365.401s">I'm</a> ready to do that work on day one by bringing my expertise, my leadership, and my ability to turn resources into results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=371.964s">If</a> I'm elected, I'll focus on three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=373.945s">First,</a> championing our public schools by supporting curriculum and making sure every student has a place to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=381.309s">Second,</a> budgeting for values and stability through transparent multi-year budgeting that protects what works and invests in areas where we need improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=388.572s">And</a> third, delivering a successful Medford High School project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=391.514s">Such</a> a joy and I'm ready to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=393.114s">I'd</a> be honored to earn your support, thank you.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1420.66s">I</a> hope that's a good one.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1461.581s">Thank</a> you, and thank you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1464.042s">27</a> questions is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1466.602s">So</a> what motivated me to run for school committee again is, and I've spoken with a lot of folks about this when I'm out canvassing, is one of the coolest things that's happened to me in my family is when my son Lincoln, he's now seven, he's in second grade at the Roberts, when he started school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1484.267s">At</a> that time, we had been in Medford about four years or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1489.108s">And</a> the way that the school community really enveloped us became our friendship circle became our family up here was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1499.452s">transformative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1500.553s">It</a> really changed the way my family lives our life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1505.657s">And</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1506.598s">And</a> I want to give back to that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1508.48s">I</a> wanted to give back to Medford since day one when I moved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1512.343s">I</a> started out by trying some volunteer opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1515.906s">I'm</a> currently a commissioner on the Water and Sewer Commission, where I look at water and sewer rates and long-term planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1521.251s">That</a> sets up <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1523.173s">That</a> matches really well with my skill set, which again is municipal finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1527.976s">What</a> municipal finance is, it's taking complicated problems and complicated rule sets in Massachusetts law and explaining them to residents, to colleagues, to subject matter experts to help them solve their problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1541.887s">Every</a> day I go to work thinking, how can I <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1545.163s">create</a> the decision architecture that supports progress in Somerville in my day job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1549.828s">I</a> want to do the same thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1550.849s">Those</a> are the skills I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1551.83s">Those</a> are the skills that I'm ready to be using here for school committee on day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1557.515s">And</a> I think when you're putting together any team, it's really valuable to have someone with municipal finance experience, whether it's a city council, a school committee, a mayor's team, or any administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1569.248s">So</a> that's my motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1571.13s">I'm</a> really fired up to get to work and help Medford, and that's my skill set. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1574.673s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2849.162s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2851.583s">One</a> of the things I've heard most consistently canvassing over the last couple months is what a resource and how valuable having a vocational technical school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2862.605s">So</a> much excitement about what a gem that is and so much opportunity for improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2867.908s">Folks</a> are telling about really exciting things that Arlington is doing with their vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2874.292s">And</a> I've seen firsthand through the Somerville High School project what a great auto tech shop can look like and what a great cooking program can look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2884.618s">to</a> prepare our kids and our neighbors for the next phase of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2889.024s">Student</a> success looks like a million things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2891.468s">It</a> can look like AP classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2893.05s">It</a> can look like athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2894.552s">It</a> can look like vocational technical training. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2899.621s">Without</a> a doubt, every person I've talked to in the last few months wants to expand the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2904.884s">They</a> want to open it up as much as possible to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2909.187s">They</a> want to integrate it into the rest of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2912.188s">Something</a> that I talked about with someone on the doors very, very recently, and that really <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2918.692s">really</a> got me fired up was how her student that was on a traditional path felt like they missed out on opportunities for technical school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2927.08s">So</a> when we separate the technical school and the traditional path and those students sort of go about their business in their own way, we miss that cross-pollination. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2934.146s">We</a> miss that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2935.608s">And</a> that is something that can really ignite, you know, the spark of curiosity in a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2943.795s">So,</a> you know, part of building the high school, part of building a new high school, which, yes, we definitely have to do, easy question, should be thinking about how we integrate the vocational school more into the built environment of what we've got here so that there's that cross-pollination, there's that opportunity, there's those conversations between kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2963.227s">So,</a> you know, I'm so proud of the vocational school and I think there's so much opportunity there.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4234.683s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4241.207s">The</a> way I feel about MCAS is colored largely by my conversations with our superintendent in Somerville, Dr. Ruben Carmona. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4250.023s">when</a> I'm looking for information on something that's novel to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4253.944s">Again,</a> my kids are seven and four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4255.185s">I</a> have not done MCAS yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4257.665s">I</a> go to the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4258.866s">Dr.</a> Carmona, what's up with MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4261.586s">What's</a> going on with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4263.187s">And</a> that's literally how I ask him, because that's how I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4266.948s">So</a> I think having this data on school, this aggregate data on school and grade and teacher performance is part of <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4276.911s">part</a> of the puzzle of improving our schools, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4279.713s">It's</a> not the only thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4284.295s">We</a> need to continue to focus on our kids, on their growth, on their engagement, on their opportunities, and on the total spectrum of what success looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4294.781s">Again,</a> success is not acing MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4301.959s">So</a> that's how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4303.02s">I</a> don't think that MCAS is something that's absolutely necessary, but I think it is a valuable tool for educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4309.103s">So</a> then what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4312.004s">What's</a> a better world? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4313.945s">Again,</a> I'm not a curriculum expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4315.846s">I'm</a> not a testing expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4317.386s">But</a> for me, we want to use that information to make data-informed decisions, not to identify outliers and make extreme reactions to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4326.751s">We</a> know generally where Medford schools are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4329.592s">We</a> know generally <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4331.373s">what</a> our opportunities are, I think the next step, we don't need MCAS to tell us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4336.877s">The</a> next step for us is to define what we want our district to look like and make a set of plans to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4342.441s">That's</a> what's important to me rather than MCAS.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6283.93s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6285.55s">Tonight's</a> conversation has been really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6287.631s">Thanks</a> for teaching me a lot of things, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6289.391s">You're</a> all amazing candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6291.392s">It's</a> clear that everybody here on stage, and you all for sticking with us, you care deeply about the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6296.673s">You</a> care deeply about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6298.073s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6299.013s">Something</a> that really resonated with me tonight, a little bit of anxiety, a little bit of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6305.675s">What</a> are the feds going to do to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6306.835s">What</a> does Proposition 2.5 mean for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6308.495s">How</a> do we find the resources? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6311.071s">to</a> keep the promise that we have to keep to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6314.114s">They're</a> not here to advocate for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6316.416s">That's</a> what we're all here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6318.838s">We're</a> looking ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6319.679s">We're</a> not sure what, you know, the word of the year is uncertainty, uncertain economy, uncertain federal environment, uncertain state environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6330.248s">What</a> I'm certain about, in this beautiful blue light that I look great in, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6337.376s">is</a> that we don't have to do more with less. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6340.941s">We</a> need to make these hard choices with clear eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6343.785s">We</a> need to discuss with the community what's important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6346.969s">And</a> we need to choose those priorities and execute them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6349.933s">When</a> I think about the committee, what I bring to the committee, years of managing public budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6355.86s">turning</a> community goals, concepts, ideas into real funded plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6361.745s">That's</a> what I do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6363.747s">We</a> need school committee members who can both champion our public schools, be cheerleaders and deliver results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6369.172s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6370.012s">That</a> means steady, transparent leadership guided by best practices, not chasing whatever's new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6376.918s">I'm</a> running because I wanna support our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6378.98s">I</a> wanna support my kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6379.801s">I</a> wanna support your kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6380.681s">I</a> wanna support our neighbors' kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6381.822s">I</a> wanna support our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6384.135s">core</a> to the responsibility of a local government is educating our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6391.88s">I</a> want to ensure that we're communicating clearly with our constituents, with our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6398.064s">I</a> want to make sure that we're budgeting soundly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6401.126s">And</a> I want to make sure that every decision we make as a school committee strengthens the most important responsibility we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6406.81s">Thanks</a> to MDCC for hosting this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6409.352s">I</a> think I speak for everyone and to everyone who took the time to hang out with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6412.734s">I'm</a> proud to be a parent and a public servant in this community and Medford deserves a school community that's focused, informed, grounded in values and a vision for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6420.819s">We</a> need a team that can plan for the future while protecting and enhancing what makes our school special today.<h2><a href="../2025-09-29_XXXXXX00139/2025-09-29_XXXXXX00139.html">Mike Mastrobuoni, Candidate for School Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=458.048s">So</a> a lot of things are going really great right now, absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=463.931s">I'm</a> really proud of the work that Jenny and Paul, who are both on the school committee, have done on labor negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=473.076s">That's</a> been really, really fantastic in terms of compensating our employees well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=482.345s">we've</a> been able to get community support for two overrides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=487.647s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=488.188s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=488.948s">Like</a> I said, a lot of things are going really well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=491.489s">But</a> the things that the school committee is primarily responsible are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=496.412s">They're</a> nuts and bolts, they're executive type things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=499.853s">So</a> I'm talking labor negotiations, I'm talking approving and developing a budget, hiring a superintendent, outlining the vision for the district, whether that's through strategic planning, thinking long term, or policy, thinking near term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=516.179s">So</a> a lot of that work is the stuff that I do on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=524.401s">So</a> I hope that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=526.72s">By</a> being on the school committee, by being able to be the biggest cheerleader of Medford public schools out there, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=538.201s">I</a> can help folks understand school budgets, that they're complex, and how state law, grants, contracts, program evaluation, how all that fits together so that we can again turn our resources into results for our kids and our families and our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=553.793s">Because</a> I think that's foundational. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=556.095s">We</a> have to really make sure that, before anything else, we're investing in our kids.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=599.136s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=599.517s">So</a> the Medford High School project is going to be the biggest decision that we're going to make in this generation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=604.738s">It</a> needs to serve kids of today, it needs to serve kids of the next generation, my seven-year-old and four-year-old, and it's going to have to serve their kids as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=614.805s">We</a> need to get this right, and it's something that we really can't compromise on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=621.809s">Thankfully,</a> my entire career in Somerville has been <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=627.172s">working</a> on some of these really big projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=630.073s">Some</a> of my first meetings in Somerville were planning meetings for the Somerville High School renovation project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=642.479s">It</a> was a $290 million high school renovation in a challenging environment during COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=650.723s">And</a> it was a really successful project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=652.144s">It's</a> a school that we're really proud of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=655.729s">I</a> want to use what I learned there to make sure that we get the best project for Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=661.311s">That's</a> something that's going to be flexible for the future in a way that our current building is not, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=666.694s">It's</a> something that needs to be accessible and energy efficient in ways that weren't priorities when that original building was built. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=675.658s">It's</a> got to be right sized for the future, and it's got to be planned for the long term to protect taxpayers, because the challenge that we're going to face is to fund that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=686.265s">a</a> debt exclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=687.625s">So</a> I don't think there's any way around building a citywide school project in Massachusetts in 2025 without a debt exclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=696.128s">So</a> we need school parents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=698.948s">We</a> need non-school parents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=700.889s">We</a> need every voter out there supporting this project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=703.19s">And</a> it's got to be the right project for Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=705.07s">So</a> that's, I think, really huge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=707.131s">And</a> my experience having done that in the Somerville High School project, and my experience doing that right now in the Winter Hill High School project, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bV9cvbINce0JCtxRFVkSc?t=716.073s">in</a> Somerville is going to be really important for the next couple of years.

 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5844.569s">Good</a> evening, good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Mike Mastrobone, 73 Fulton Spring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5849.453s">I'm</a> a parent, I'm also a municipal finance professional, and I strongly support the proposed zoning updates, primarily because they align with previously stated goals of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5860.581s">First,</a> increasing density and mixed use projects near transit and squares means young families, downsizing seniors, and first-time homeowners, as examples, can have access to opportunities to live here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5872.321s">Right</a> now in our schools, we have 62 McKinney-Vento students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5875.364s">These</a> are neighbors that couldn't continue living here, and we pay to transport them back to Medford from where they're living now after becoming homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5884.654s">This</a> is a symptom of housing affordability, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5886.896s">Full</a> stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5888.057s">Second,</a> like it or not, Proposition 2.5 in Massachusetts is a restrictive limit that we need to take very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5894.119s">If</a> Medford is not saying yes to investment, we are falling behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5897.339s">We're</a> falling behind in revenue to fund our basic city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5900.56s">We're</a> falling behind in revenue to fund investments in infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5904.221s">And</a> we're also falling behind in our ability to fully fund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5908.022s">These</a> are non-negotiables as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5910.978s">Third,</a> the amendments to zoning before you are essential to translate our comprehensive plan that already exists into reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5917.502s">The</a> action items from that plan are littered with recommendations made in the updated zoning that's before this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5924.105s">To</a> name a few, creating accessible 12 and 18 hour communities, ensuring affordable housing for all, <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5929.468s">and</a> achieving our sustainability goals, as well as encouraging balanced growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5935.114s">So</a> tonight I want to make it clear I support the recommendations made in the zoning reform package. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5939.418s">I</a> urge you to move forward at the time that you see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5942.081s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5942.601s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0/2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-04-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5648.69s">Yeah,</a> just just really briefly, I'm wondering what our ongoing engagement with the call center looks like? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5653.995s">Is</a> there we are we going to have presentations on specific topics from them on our regular meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5660.52s">Or</a> are they going to be advising us answering questions that we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5664.183s">Like,</a> what does that look like?
