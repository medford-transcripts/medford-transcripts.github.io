<h2><a href="../2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU/2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU.html">Community Development Board 07-09-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5844.569s">Good</a> evening, good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Mike Mastrobone, 73 Fulton Spring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5849.453s">I'm</a> a parent, I'm also a municipal finance professional, and I strongly support the proposed zoning updates, primarily because they align with previously stated goals of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5860.581s">First,</a> increasing density and mixed use projects near transit and squares means young families, downsizing seniors, and first-time homeowners, as examples, can have access to opportunities to live here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5872.321s">Right</a> now in our schools, we have 62 McKinney-Vento students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5875.364s">These</a> are neighbors that couldn't continue living here, and we pay to transport them back to Medford from where they're living now after becoming homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5884.654s">This</a> is a symptom of housing affordability, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5886.896s">Full</a> stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5888.057s">Second,</a> like it or not, Proposition 2.5 in Massachusetts is a restrictive limit that we need to take very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5894.119s">If</a> Medford is not saying yes to investment, we are falling behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5897.339s">We're</a> falling behind in revenue to fund our basic city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5900.56s">We're</a> falling behind in revenue to fund investments in infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5904.221s">And</a> we're also falling behind in our ability to fully fund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5908.022s">These</a> are non-negotiables as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5910.978s">Third,</a> the amendments to zoning before you are essential to translate our comprehensive plan that already exists into reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5917.502s">The</a> action items from that plan are littered with recommendations made in the updated zoning that's before this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5924.105s">To</a> name a few, creating accessible 12 and 18 hour communities, ensuring affordable housing for all, <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5929.468s">and</a> achieving our sustainability goals, as well as encouraging balanced growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5935.114s">So</a> tonight I want to make it clear I support the recommendations made in the zoning reform package. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5939.418s">I</a> urge you to move forward at the time that you see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5942.081s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=5942.601s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0/2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-04-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9732.413s">Good</a> evening, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9733.153s">Mike</a> Mastroboni, 73 Fulton Spring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9736.514s">I'll</a> be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9738.215s">I</a> think either proposal moving to ward or district-based representation is a positive move. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9745.537s">I</a> think for a couple of reasons, one, lowering the barrier to entry for people trying to campaign in terms of cost, in terms of effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9754.74s">I</a> think secondly, having a representative <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9761.088s">That</a> you can go to on a local basis, I think, for me pushes me towards the. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9768.505s">eight</a> individual board Councilors approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9772.688s">I</a> respect the immense amount of work that the Charter Review Committee did over a number of years, the level of effort they did in reaching out to as many residents as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9783.075s">And</a> the last thing I'll say, this isn't really my area of expertise, but I think looking retrospectively at turnout numbers and voting numbers, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9791.4s">I</a> think it's a bit of a red herring, you know, when people are able to when people running for office are able to focus on individual wards, you know, different wards have different ways of outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9805.222s">and</a> people be able to meet people where they are in a way that makes sense, whether it's tough students or folks in apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9811.425s">We're</a> gonna be having a lot more big apartment buildings coming in the city, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9814.466s">That's</a> a challenge that everybody will have to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9819.148s">So</a> I think for that reason, I support word-based city councilors, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9827.291s">I</a> appreciate the work everyone's done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9829.052s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2023-01-05_3oP-OTu9DFs/2023-01-05_3oP-OTu9DFs.html">Charter Study Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=54.692s">Melvin,</a> Laurel, there's a bunch of, there's like an iPhone user, a cell phone user. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=59.176s">Let</a> me know what you want me to just submit everyone.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=73.507s">Here's</a> John, I just let him in.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=76.469s">So</a> it looks like then everybody else is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=78.471s">Okay,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4036.419s">Thank</a> you, uh, no, but thank you, Anthony, Michael, and Marilyn for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4041.023s">Um,</a> we really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4041.904s">I</a> think I speak for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4042.744s">I</a> say that, um, I'm the, uh, by day I'm the budget director in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4047.768s">So</a> this is a process, um, uh, about which I am a little bit familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4052.272s">I've</a> been involved in the charter review, especially with respect to the, the CIP and the sort of the role of finance and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4060.119s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4061.508s">I'm</a> relatively, you know, compared to the rest of the group, probably I'm very new to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4067.329s">So</a> what's important to me as a newer resident here, at least in this process, specifically kind of like, you know, what extent do we want to hear from the mayor, from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4080.973s">Can</a> we hear from the mayor and the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4083.392s">or</a> are we simply negotiating with ourselves to find out sort of what can or cannot pass? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4088.775s">I</a> think I come at this from obviously like an administrative good governance bias, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4095.658s">Just</a> because of my day job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4097.499s">And</a> I wanna find out what relevant comparisons in terms of size, scope of government there are between like Medford and the surrounding communities I'm not interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4112.211s">In</a> reinventing the wheel here, there's best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4114.772s">We're</a> not the first ones to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4117.414s">So</a> trying to figure out what's worked in other places and what have been pain points. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4122.996s">And</a> then really trying to strike the middle ground between flexibility and creating strong guardrails. <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=4132.301s">I</a> think at the end of the day, well, I'll leave it there.
 <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5648.69s">Yeah,</a> just just really briefly, I'm wondering what our ongoing engagement with the call center looks like? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5653.995s">Is</a> there we are we going to have presentations on specific topics from them on our regular meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5660.52s">Or</a> are they going to be advising us answering questions that we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/3oP-OTu9DFs&t=5664.183s">Like,</a> what does that look like?
