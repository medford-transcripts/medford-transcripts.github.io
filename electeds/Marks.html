    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=386.104s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, uh, you know, year after year after year, we speak about this time of the year about repainting our crosswalks, which is a major public safety issue in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=397.702s">[Marks]</a>: year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=399.022s">[Marks]</a>: Some years, it takes several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=401.423s">[Marks]</a>: Some years, it takes just a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=404.724s">[Marks]</a>: You know, Mr. President, it would only make sense from a standpoint of public safety in our community to install thermoplastic crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=415.066s">[Marks]</a>: Painted crosswalks last one year, if that, and then you're back again painting them immediately if you get to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=423.442s">[Marks]</a>: Thermoplastic crosswalks, their life expectancy is three to five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=429.887s">[Marks]</a>: They're highly reflective, much better than paint, so you can see them from a distance when you're driving, and you can see if someone's in the crosswalk from a distance, and they're slip resistant also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=440.977s">[Marks]</a>: We wouldn't have to discuss these issues every single year, when are we gonna get out and paint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=447.042s">[Marks]</a>: We gotta get our whole crew at DPW out to paint the crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=451.271s">[Marks]</a>: Wouldn't it be more efficient, not only for public safety reasons, but more efficiency to have a crosswalk painted once every five years rather than five times?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=461.798s">[Marks]</a>: It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=464.18s">[Marks]</a>: It really doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=466.281s">[Marks]</a>: Thermoplastic crosswalks are a little more expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=470.08s">[Marks]</a>: But you know what, the state uses them on the highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=472.601s">[Marks]</a>: They use them for a reason, because studies have been done to say this is a far better way of marking intersections and crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=480.403s">[Marks]</a>: And if we're really all interested about truly public safety concerns, we would all be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=488.765s">[Marks]</a>: And we wouldn't have to talk for another five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=491.966s">[Marks]</a>: But year after year after year, it gets brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=494.868s">[Marks]</a>: We hope the city gets out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=496.41s">[Marks]</a>: And then we find out there's 40 in this area that weren't done, another 40 in this area, another 40 in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=503.335s">[Marks]</a>: And then we do a piecemeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=504.856s">[Marks]</a>: And by the time we're done with them, the snow starts to come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=508.439s">[Marks]</a>: That's what happens every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=510.321s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know what it's going to take to get a handle on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=513.624s">[Marks]</a>: It's no secret, Mr. President, thermoplastic has been in existence for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=518.905s">[Marks]</a>: Federal, state highways, they all use thermoplastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=522.627s">[Marks]</a>: Painting is a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=525.909s">[Marks]</a>: It's almost as bad as marking your streets that need to be swept with paper pamphlets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=531.973s">[Marks]</a>: It's almost as archaic as marking your streets with paper pamphlets when you have to do street sweeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=538.342s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't know, Mr. President, maybe we should be putting a resolution together as a council saying, you know what, Mr. Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=544.988s">[Marks]</a>: We want to see, if it's too late this year, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=548.771s">[Marks]</a>: The budget's coming up very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=551.153s">[Marks]</a>: We're going to start discussion budget in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=555.076s">[Marks]</a>: We should be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks if there's a cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=560.461s">[Marks]</a>: associated with you, I know there's a cost associated with it, that should be in the budget and then we won't have to discuss public safety issues year after year and we can focus our time on issues of importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=571.736s">[Marks]</a>: Well, safety is important, but when you have your crosswalks painted, then you can look, with thermoplastic, then you can look at other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=578.198s">[Marks]</a>: You don't have to keep on refocusing your attention on the same issue year after year after year, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=584.521s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=585.181s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=788.84s">[Marks]</a>: I just want to mention what my colleague mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=791.441s">[Marks]</a>: The pilot program is for raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=794.543s">[Marks]</a>: I'm mentioning about thermoplastic crosswalk, which is very different than a raised crosswalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=799.106s">[Marks]</a>: Although I support both initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=801.127s">[Marks]</a>: Just want to set the record straight on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=804.049s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. Clerk, call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=908.941s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=910.282s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, at this weekend's memorial, uh, ceremony, I had a resident come up to me and hand me a list of, uh, 13 names of just residents in his area, uh, of people that support a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=923.992s">[Marks]</a>: And, um, if you look at the list, Mr. President's Lowell court,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=928.258s">[Marks]</a>: Rockwell Ave, Pool Street, Evans Street, Middlesex Ave, Chipman, Burnside, Lawrence,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=939.172s">[Marks]</a>: Hurlcroft, Spring Street, Central Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=942.474s">[Marks]</a>: These are residents, Mr. President, name and phone number of people that support a dog park just in a small general area off of Central Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=951.34s">[Marks]</a>: A small area that this gentleman went out and just got a number of signatures of people that support a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=957.123s">[Marks]</a>: You can take this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=958.644s">[Marks]</a>: and a hundred fold throughout the community, people are wondering where this dog park is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=963.587s">[Marks]</a>: It was several weeks ago that I offered a resolution and Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's been answered or not by the mayor, asking for the status of the dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=972.073s">[Marks]</a>: Where is the dog park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=973.374s">[Marks]</a>: I don't believe we got a response back from the mayor and that was voted on this council, by this council, seven weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=981.355s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know what's happening, but if the mayor's gonna make statements that he received mitigation and what the mitigation is and so forth, then at the very least, residents should hold him accountable to what was stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=998.258s">[Marks]</a>: If part of the mitigation for the Bridge Fast 14 project was a dog park, then where is the dog park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1007.341s">[Marks]</a>: Is there a location, Mr. Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1009.666s">[Marks]</a>: Who's working on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1010.647s">[Marks]</a>: Did you create an advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1012.892s">[Marks]</a>: What's going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1013.793s">[Marks]</a>: All we want is a status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1015.834s">[Marks]</a>: I know things don't happen overnight, but all we want is a status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1019.796s">[Marks]</a>: So for those thousands of pet owners in this community that want a place that their dog can run free, because that's what a dog park is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1027.261s">[Marks]</a>: When you take your dog to a local park now, they have to be leashed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1031.583s">[Marks]</a>: They can't run free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1033.084s">[Marks]</a>: This would be similar to the dog park that's in Somerville, the dog park that's in Cambridge, and all the surrounding communities that do have currently dog parks right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1042.049s">[Marks]</a>: This would allow them to exercise and run their dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1046.172s">[Marks]</a>: We're not asking for anything other than what the mayor said he negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1053.216s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5897.921s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5898.642s">[Marks]</a>: Council Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5900.29s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5901.311s">[Marks]</a>: And I appreciate what Carol Rosen had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5905.353s">[Marks]</a>: A lot of that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5907.274s">[Marks]</a>: However, in order to accomplish some of what Carolyn spoke about, you need to have seven independent counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5916.179s">[Marks]</a>: And that's key to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5918.961s">[Marks]</a>: If people aren't going to be independent behind this reeling, then it does break down to just a political process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5928.49s">[Marks]</a>: Does the mayor have his votes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5929.711s">[Marks]</a>: And then he pushes his initiatives through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5932.252s">[Marks]</a>: You know, tonight, Councilor Penta mentioned to the mayor at the very end, I don't know if anyone else heard, Councilor Penta asked, he said, Mr. Mayor, because this project now, you're asking for an additional million dollars, I'd like for you to sit down and create a priority list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5947.201s">[Marks]</a>: Is that what you stated, Councilor Penta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5950.503s">[Marks]</a>: And the mayor said, I'm not gonna sit down and put together a priority list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5954.546s">[Marks]</a>: He said, we can afford to do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5957.23s">[Marks]</a>: That's exactly what the mayor said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5959.712s">[Marks]</a>: We can afford to do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5961.994s">[Marks]</a>: So it's great, Carolyn, I can agree with what you're saying, the fact that we need to sit down and so forth, but if you have the mentality that we're hearing from the administration that there's no priority list, there's no list based on what we can afford to do, because according to the mayor, we can afford everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5984.36s">[Marks]</a>: And not only can we afford everything, we can afford to do it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5989.081s">[Marks]</a>: Not that we should have done it over the last 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5992.422s">[Marks]</a>: You know, when the DPW building was condemned years ago, the police station has been a pit for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6000.945s">[Marks]</a>: A pit for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6002.245s">[Marks]</a>: The high school pool's been down for seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6006.867s">[Marks]</a>: And the associated cost we heard about, the additional 1.2 million, was further deterioration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6014.67s">[Marks]</a>: So because we didn't do, as you mentioned, Councilor Caviello, why don't we do this seven years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6018.592s">[Marks]</a>: Because we waited, it cost us an additional several hundred thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6023.354s">[Marks]</a>: And as Carolyn mentioned, and I mentioned it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6027.876s">[Marks]</a>: Well, that was part of it, was further deterioration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6030.517s">[Marks]</a>: Also inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6032.698s">[Marks]</a>: Now there's an inflationary index regarding construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6036.78s">[Marks]</a>: So if the mayor took the cost from a 2007 architectural report that was established saying the report's gonna<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6044.102s">[Marks]</a>: uh, the pool is going to cost us 2.3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6046.423s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor could have looked up the index.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6047.864s">[Marks]</a>: I've got someone in the building department look up the cost of construction work done in 2007 compared to construction work done in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6055.949s">[Marks]</a>: And he could have said, counsel, I know the figure has increased by three, $400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6061.413s">[Marks]</a>: Now that's still not an exact figure, but I know there's an additional three or 4,000, three or $400,000 built into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6070.018s">[Marks]</a>: But when he came to us several months back,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6072.833s">[Marks]</a>: As I stated to the mayor tonight, one of the first questions, Mr. Mayor, you originally asked us for $2.3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6078.817s">[Marks]</a>: And at the time, you knew there was accessibility issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6082.3s">[Marks]</a>: At the time, you knew there was inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6084.341s">[Marks]</a>: You knew all this already, Mr. Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6086.262s">[Marks]</a>: Why would you come to us for $2.3 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6089.144s">[Marks]</a>: And he said there was no way of figuring this out until a secondary report was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6096.99s">[Marks]</a>: And the only thing I can think of now is, we're all on board with the DPW yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6102.0s">[Marks]</a>: Is that the figure that we voted on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6104.582s">[Marks]</a>: Is that the figure that we're going to end up costing for the DPWR?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6108.865s">[Marks]</a>: Or is it going to be double or triple that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6111.387s">[Marks]</a>: Because that seems to be the process how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6118.092s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know how every other entity and every other company and business and municipality does it, but it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6127.659s">[Marks]</a>: as someone was quoted in the paper saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6129.86s">[Marks]</a>: You know what, Mr. Mayor, if that wasn't a fair and accurate estimate, then why give one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6136.364s">[Marks]</a>: Why come out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6138.645s">[Marks]</a>: Because it was the politically correct thing to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6142.408s">[Marks]</a>: Come out ahead of time and say, okay, we got the pool on target now, and I'll go back and get a million dollars somewhere down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6150.472s">[Marks]</a>: We heard that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6152.113s">[Marks]</a>: We were told by the administration tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6155.219s">[Marks]</a>: that once we do the pool, spectators, mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters, brothers, can't watch their kid swimming and meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6164.024s">[Marks]</a>: There's nowhere for spectators to sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6167.846s">[Marks]</a>: It's such a beautiful facility once it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6170.707s">[Marks]</a>: There's nowhere for spectators to sit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6173.568s">[Marks]</a>: And we heard from the mayor, which is par for the course, we'll handle that after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6179.071s">[Marks]</a>: We'll take care of that after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6181.553s">[Marks]</a>: similar to the field of dreams and the accessibility issue at the field of dreams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6186.317s">[Marks]</a>: We'll make it accessible after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6188.199s">[Marks]</a>: We all know what happened with the field of dreams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6191.782s">[Marks]</a>: You can't continue to operate a city in this fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6196.086s">[Marks]</a>: And I agree with councilor Penta, you know, we've been asking for this priority list for a long time now, several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6204.414s">[Marks]</a>: And finally the mayor came out with chart the course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6208.134s">[Marks]</a>: And he gave us a list, not in any particular order, he refused to give it any order, a list of projects that need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6216.759s">[Marks]</a>: And we heard tonight the lack of maintenance seems to be the Achilles heel with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6224.544s">[Marks]</a>: No maintenance, no maintenance, no upkeep, and everything deteriorates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6230.928s">[Marks]</a>: We don't even know what the pool right now, who's gonna manage the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6236.496s">[Marks]</a>: You saw the equipment in the basement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6239.197s">[Marks]</a>: You saw those tanks that house the sand and the overflow for water, giant tanks that are six feet in circumference, 10 feet high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6248.881s">[Marks]</a>: You think someone's going to go down there like you're changing your pool and look at the chemicals and dip a little cotton swab in there and say, oh, everything looks fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6256.544s">[Marks]</a>: You need constant 24-hour, seven-day-a-week maintenance and someone that knows how to handle pool maintenance specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6265.575s">[Marks]</a>: And there's no mention of it at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6268.897s">[Marks]</a>: We heard how the pool may generate money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6271.639s">[Marks]</a>: Oh, don't worry, the mayor said, this pool's gonna generate money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6274.921s">[Marks]</a>: And he referred to other communities that generate money with their pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6280.045s">[Marks]</a>: Just the business we wanna be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6282.927s">[Marks]</a>: Just the business we wanna be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6285.489s">[Marks]</a>: Let's rent our total facilities out to generate money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6289.832s">[Marks]</a>: And not put a nickel back into the wear and tear and the upkeep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6294.428s">[Marks]</a>: And in five years from now, we'll be discussing this pool again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6297.01s">[Marks]</a>: It's all it's going to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6299.492s">[Marks]</a>: We'll be discussing this pool again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6304.456s">[Marks]</a>: These are the issues we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6306.197s">[Marks]</a>: And I agree with Carolyn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6307.238s">[Marks]</a>: I agree with members of this council and we should have the paperwork and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6311.502s">[Marks]</a>: But let me tell you, without seven independent counselors, none of this is going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6317.486s">[Marks]</a>: It's always going to be political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6320.202s">[Marks]</a>: And Carolyn, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6321.502s">[Marks]</a>: What happens is they pin person against person, organization against organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6326.244s">[Marks]</a>: None of us are opposed to having a swimming pool at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6329.505s">[Marks]</a>: I swam in the pool when I was at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6331.986s">[Marks]</a>: It's a great asset we have as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6334.747s">[Marks]</a>: We're lucky to have a pool of that size and caliber within our confines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6340.469s">[Marks]</a>: We're very fortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6344.19s">[Marks]</a>: But we can't continue to operate this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6347.191s">[Marks]</a>: We can't continue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6348.999s">[Marks]</a>: year after year after year to look back and say, well, what are we going to accomplish right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6354.822s">[Marks]</a>: These have to be done long-term, long-term systematic approaches to capital improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6362.645s">[Marks]</a>: You can't do everything in a year or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6365.586s">[Marks]</a>: This is 20 years worth of neglect, 20 years of neglect and lack of upkeep, and we want to accomplish it in one or two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6375.271s">[Marks]</a>: That's what we're looking to do, one or two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6379.804s">[Marks]</a>: It can't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6381.045s">[Marks]</a>: We can't afford, we can't sustain spending of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6385.35s">[Marks]</a>: People are struggling now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6388.312s">[Marks]</a>: And the last thing they want is their taxes to go skyrocketing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6396.12s">[Marks]</a>: You know, we're in a rock and a hard place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6397.582s">[Marks]</a>: We already, seven of us already took a vote on the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6401.546s">[Marks]</a>: We already said we support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6403.919s">[Marks]</a>: having a pool at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6405.6s">[Marks]</a>: We even think it's a priority, and we're going to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6408.622s">[Marks]</a>: And then to come back several months later and say, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6413.244s">[Marks]</a>: There are some additional costs of $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6415.486s">[Marks]</a>: The total project was $2.3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6423.85s">[Marks]</a>: You come back with $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6426.492s">[Marks]</a>: How outrageous is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6428.673s">[Marks]</a>: I could see $50,000, $75,000 for different costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6432.751s">[Marks]</a>: Another million too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6435.092s">[Marks]</a>: And the phone calls I'm receiving is, geez, how come the council's not supporting the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6439.855s">[Marks]</a>: How come you don't want the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6441.216s">[Marks]</a>: My son or daughter has to get up at five in the morning to go swim somewhere else, and I have to drive them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6449.48s">[Marks]</a>: And I sympathize with the parents, because they've been doing this for seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6454.403s">[Marks]</a>: However, what I explain to the parents is, the council's on board with the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6459.045s">[Marks]</a>: As I stated to the mayor tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6461.67s">[Marks]</a>: I thought there were going to be people swimming in there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6464.631s">[Marks]</a>: That's why we took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6469.313s">[Marks]</a>: And now we're being told it's another million, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6472.294s">[Marks]</a>: And then the locker room is a different issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6474.695s">[Marks]</a>: And he found, miraculously found funding for the locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6478.516s">[Marks]</a>: So it's not going to cost us much for the locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6484.178s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6486.619s">[Marks]</a>: You know, at some point, something has to give.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6493.456s">[Marks]</a>: And the administration was up there in full force tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6496.738s">[Marks]</a>: It's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6497.158s">[Marks]</a>: We have the bond initiative before us to vote on the actual expenditure and not one department head shows up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6506.122s">[Marks]</a>: Not one person from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6509.404s">[Marks]</a>: We call for a meeting on site at the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6513.005s">[Marks]</a>: We couldn't get in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6513.726s">[Marks]</a>: There was so many people from the administration up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6516.947s">[Marks]</a>: It was mobbed with people from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6521.786s">[Marks]</a>: And they were quick to come to the mayor's defense when things were mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6526.068s">[Marks]</a>: They were quick to say, oh, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6528.61s">[Marks]</a>: There's nothing in the report, as Diane McLeod said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6532.892s">[Marks]</a>: There's nothing in the report in 2007 that talked about accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6537.355s">[Marks]</a>: And I said, there most certainly was something in the 2007 report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6541.017s">[Marks]</a>: You should take a further look at it that mentioned, if you do the construction of the pool, it's going to trigger off accessibility issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6550.609s">[Marks]</a>: So be on notice that you're going to have additional cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6553.871s">[Marks]</a>: And the city was on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6556.132s">[Marks]</a>: The city knew about these additional costs back in 2007.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6561.214s">[Marks]</a>: But we have department heads saying, there was no mention of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6564.295s">[Marks]</a>: We weren't looking for accessibility issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6567.377s">[Marks]</a>: Actually, they mentioned tonight that when the project came out, all they were looking to do was the pool and the surrounding platform around the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6578.271s">[Marks]</a>: And I mentioned to the department head, why didn't we look at something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6581.893s">[Marks]</a>: Well, that's what we looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6582.993s">[Marks]</a>: And I said, you looked at it because that was what you asked the architect to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6590.837s">[Marks]</a>: You asked them to look at that specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6593.198s">[Marks]</a>: That's what we're going to pay you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6594.679s">[Marks]</a>: You give us the results on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6596.24s">[Marks]</a>: What do we need for a pool and a platform?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6600.142s">[Marks]</a>: So it was the administration that said, we're not going to look at accessibility issues in the bathroom, in the locker rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6608.373s">[Marks]</a>: They're the ones that commissioned the report, not this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6612.895s">[Marks]</a>: So the only reason why the locker rooms weren't looked at in 2007 was because the administration, at that point, maybe didn't feel it was necessary to talk about accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6626.659s">[Marks]</a>: Or maybe felt by talking about accessibility, you're going to inflate the project, the cost of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6633.962s">[Marks]</a>: And maybe you can't fly a project for 3.5,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6637.802s">[Marks]</a>: million, but you could fly a project for $2.3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6642.286s">[Marks]</a>: These are the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6643.748s">[Marks]</a>: And that's why, when I said last week, and I still stand by it, we should have been presented with a close estimate, the closest possible estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6651.836s">[Marks]</a>: No smoke and mirrors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6655.86s">[Marks]</a>: The closest possible estimate, Mr. President, so we could vote on it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6661.112s">[Marks]</a>: If we thought it's too expensive, as Counselor Caviello mentioned, let's go back and look at some other proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6666.553s">[Marks]</a>: Maybe we don't have to do X, we'll do Y. We'll do Z and Y, whatever it may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6672.074s">[Marks]</a>: But we were never given that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=6676.355s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7498.913s">[Marks]</a>: Question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7499.733s">[Marks]</a>: So is this your first owner's license and method?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7506.192s">[Marks]</a>: But it's your first, you've never had an owner's license before in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7509.834s">[Marks]</a>: Have you driven in the city before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7512.095s">[Marks]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7519.438s">[Marks]</a>: He has an owner's license now, currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7523.3s">[Marks]</a>: And this is the addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7524.761s">[Marks]</a>: Two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7542.677s">[Marks]</a>: So where does that lead us now with the number of ono?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7573.19s">[Marks]</a>: And where are you going to be operating out of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7580.497s">[Marks]</a>: 40 Canal Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7582.642s">[Marks]</a>: And I assume you're gonna hire, you're gonna look to hire people to drive these cabs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7595.095s">[Marks]</a>: Roughly how many drivers would you need to have to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7604.144s">[Marks]</a>: Two drivers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7607.718s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I've, in the past several weeks, not voted for operator licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7614.902s">[Marks]</a>: The owner licenses I will support, and as soon as the magic number of 50, or if we plan on reducing it, is met, then I think that issue will be resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7626.247s">[Marks]</a>: However, the operator license right now I will not support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7630.229s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, but this gentleman is not asking for an operator license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7632.311s">[Marks]</a>: You're asking for an owner's license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7634.612s">[Marks]</a>: And until we get a new ordinance on the, on the board, uh, and look at the application form that's in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7643.879s">[Marks]</a>: So, uh, we can tackle the issues that, uh, have been confronting this community with, uh, taxi operators operating outside of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7652.646s">[Marks]</a>: Um, so I will support this here tonight, uh, for the taxi owner license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=353.183s">[Marks]</a>: The 35th regular meeting of the Meffitt City Council will be called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=361.572s">[Marks]</a>: Clerk, call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=386.255s">[Marks]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=387.015s">[Marks]</a>: Five present, two absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=877.42s">[Marks]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=878.901s">[Marks]</a>: Motions, orders, and resolutions 17-750 offered by vice president Mox, be resolved that the construction work on Harvard street from main street to Benton road be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=914.957s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=916.398s">[Marks]</a>: Um, we all received, uh, uh, several emails regarding the, uh, national grid, uh, is determined that a gas main on Harvard street for main street to Benton road will be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=929.303s">[Marks]</a>: Um, starting Monday, November 13th, uh, which was yesterday lasting four weeks, taking a place Monday through Friday from 7.00 PM to 5.00 AM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=940.006s">[Marks]</a>: That was the original request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=942.142s">[Marks]</a>: uh, since then, uh, there's been some, uh, emails going back and forth, uh, that the work will now take place during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=951.185s">[Marks]</a>: And, um, I have yet to get confirmation from chief Sacco who needs to make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=957.907s">[Marks]</a>: But, um, the concerns I've heard from residents, and I know many of my colleagues have, uh, was really the lack of notification of residents in the area and the lack of input from any residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=971.003s">[Marks]</a>: Some residents found out through finding a flyer on the street that this work was going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=978.427s">[Marks]</a>: And many homes in the area that directly abut this and whose bedroom windows are located within 20 feet from potential construction at night naturally would have some grave concerns about sleep disruption during a four week span.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=998.197s">[Marks]</a>: I know there's a number of residents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1000.131s">[Marks]</a>: here that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1004.114s">[Marks]</a>: And again, I would ask that this project be duly notified through Reverse 911 in the city, Mr. President, alerting residents when this work will take place, how long the work will take, and when it will be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1022.525s">[Marks]</a>: If it's going to be during the day or the evening is extremely important, Mr. President, that residents are aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1029.059s">[Marks]</a>: So at this time I'd open the floor if anyone from the direct abuttance would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1956.553s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, if I could, and I want to thank the residents for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1960.436s">[Marks]</a>: Um, where, where this is a non emergent job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1965.04s">[Marks]</a>: Um, I know it's dealing with a gas line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1968.123s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, I think it's crucial that, uh, the city and I'm not going to point the finger at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1973.909s">[Marks]</a>: uh, the utility company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1975.35s">[Marks]</a>: It's the city that represents the residents of this community, not the utility company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1980.293s">[Marks]</a>: The city should have a clerk of the work assigned to the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1984.156s">[Marks]</a>: Residents should be aware of exactly who in the city is the contact person for every project that's taken place in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1992.662s">[Marks]</a>: And, uh, if a traffic plan, as, uh, uh, Mr. D Antonio mentioned, uh, is out there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1999.016s">[Marks]</a>: Everyone should be aware if they're going to be closing off certain sections, if they're going to be diverting traffic, everyone in that area should be aware, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2008.108s">[Marks]</a>: And I have yet to hear anyone that's aware of anything that's going on with this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2012.914s">[Marks]</a>: Also, the fact that it is not an emergency project, to me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2017.489s">[Marks]</a>: The city should be sitting down with National Grid and talking about mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2022.974s">[Marks]</a>: What can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2024.696s">[Marks]</a>: You know, we realize lines get older and so forth and need replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2029.62s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think anyone doubts that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2031.562s">[Marks]</a>: But on behalf of the residents of this community, we should be able to sit down with these utility companies and request certain things, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2040.638s">[Marks]</a>: And I know on Harvard, uh, you know, we've talked about broken sidewalks at nauseam, uh, up and down Harvard street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2047.443s">[Marks]</a>: Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go to the utility company and say, you know what, uh, because of the inconvenience, we would ask that you replace, you know, 30 different sidewalks on Harvard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2057.771s">[Marks]</a>: Um, you know, to me that that's a no brainer that that should, those discussions should be happening between the city and the utility companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2065.937s">[Marks]</a>: And, uh, I think all they're doing is approving things and no follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2070.529s">[Marks]</a>: and we're seeing it time and time again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2073.07s">[Marks]</a>: So I would ask Mr. President in the form of a motion that a clerk of the works be assigned to this project immediately and the residents be notified who in the city is going to be the contact person for this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2088.557s">[Marks]</a>: The traffic plan be provided also, Mr. President, whether it's on the website so city residents can view it or that the director butters receive a copy of the traffic plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2100.714s">[Marks]</a>: And also that, going forward, that the city discuss mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2106.136s">[Marks]</a>: When a project of this size comes in and it's going to be an impact to the community through traffic, through noise, through disruption of everyday quality of life, as was mentioned, you get the holidays coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2119.079s">[Marks]</a>: You know, these are the things that we should be using as leverage with the utility companies to get them, Mr. President, to do curb to curb, as we've talked about, restoration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2129.938s">[Marks]</a>: rather than just restoration in the area where they're digging, new sidewalks, new handicap ramps, improved lighting, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2138.91s">[Marks]</a>: But this is the time to hit up these multi-billion dollar companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2142.729s">[Marks]</a>: on behalf of the residents of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2144.731s">[Marks]</a>: So I would offer those three initiatives, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2180.839s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2181.62s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2184.442s">[Marks]</a>: We received the correspondence, um, from the, uh, city solicitor, uh, to Mayor Burke regarding council resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2193.137s">[Marks]</a>: 16 dash seven eight three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2194.838s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, this was a resolution I offered well over a year ago that the city and the city, the city council and their wisdom, uh, asked that, uh, an ordinance be drafted up by the city solicitor who I am very grateful, uh, took the time to draft this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2210.706s">[Marks]</a>: Um, I would like to send this particular paper to the subcommittee on business and economic development, uh, just for the edification of the viewing audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2220.191s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, this is a consumer protection ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2222.897s">[Marks]</a>: And if I could just read it briefly, Mr. President, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2225.999s">[Marks]</a>: It says dear mayor Burke and the above caption resolution, the city council requested that the city solicitor draft an ordinance requiring any retail or wholesale business, which is made aware of an incorrect store price that has the ability to communicate with the customer through the offering of a store savings card or other method method be required to refund or credit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2250.76s">[Marks]</a>: all customers who purchase an item marked incorrectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2255.465s">[Marks]</a>: It goes on to say the code of mass regulations already requires prompt payment be made to customers who have been overcharged and the store owners maintain a price accuracy and missing price report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2267.256s">[Marks]</a>: This takes it one step further, Mr. President, and I think it really is a consumer-friendly ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2273.837s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm not aware of anyone in this state that has an ordinance like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2278.719s">[Marks]</a>: But once a store is on notice of an incorrect price, you can go up and talk to the store manager and they'll reimburse you the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2287.743s">[Marks]</a>: Some stores will even give you the item for free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2290.985s">[Marks]</a>: What I'm asking, Mr. President, we take it one step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2293.886s">[Marks]</a>: In this day and age with technology and store cards and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2297.045s">[Marks]</a>: credit and debit cards and everything else, that store, once they're on notice that a price is incorrectly marked, they should be able to go through that day's worth of receipts and see who else bought that item and maybe wasn't savvy enough to pick up on the incorrect price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2312.636s">[Marks]</a>: And then they reach out to the customer and either a debit credit, their debit card or their charge card, or send them out, uh, the difference in the meal, Mr. President, um, on the difference,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2324.804s">[Marks]</a>: uh, and price that was incorrectly marked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2327.645s">[Marks]</a>: Um, Steve, uh, Champoli, who's our, uh, director of seal of weights and measures, uh, reviewed this language and, uh, his, I don't want to quote him, but he said he can't wait to get this enacted so he can start enforcing it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2344.968s">[Marks]</a>: Um, so I would ask that it be sent to the subcommittee for, uh, its due diligence and vetting and, uh, eventual passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2353.906s">[Marks]</a>: of this very important consumer-friendly protection ordinance, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2358.268s">[Marks]</a>: Second, Mr. Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2478.118s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, just if I could, just for the education of the viewing audience, Mr. Champoli is responsible for all scales in the community, as well as pumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2489.961s">[Marks]</a>: And if you look at any of the gas pumps, it should have a dated sticker on it that shows that it was re-inspected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2496.377s">[Marks]</a>: uh, not only for accuracy, but also the octane level, uh, is checked at the pumps too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2501.201s">[Marks]</a>: So if you provide that information, uh, we can definitely add that to his list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2505.404s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2625.405s">[Marks]</a>: I didn't have a chance to review them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2626.866s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President asked that they'd be tabled for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=395.851s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scott Pelly has a similar paper, if you'd like to read that also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=421.259s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=422.64s">[Marks]</a>: And I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=429.065s">[Marks]</a>: If anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Porter Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=439.733s">[Marks]</a>: If you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=449.541s">[Marks]</a>: And this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area, being placed around the Rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area, but the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=473.337s">[Marks]</a>: and or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=483.031s">[Marks]</a>: And this particular location would be a prime location for a bus shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=488.635s">[Marks]</a>: to protect residents that use that, I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=496.578s">[Marks]</a>: And it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=505.16s">[Marks]</a>: It also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=510.842s">[Marks]</a>: And Rep Donato reached out to me just recently<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=514.023s">[Marks]</a>: and said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=524.014s">[Marks]</a>: And the MBTA told them they do a ridership count, and they recently performed one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=530.433s">[Marks]</a>: and said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=534.856s">[Marks]</a>: And the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=542.061s">[Marks]</a>: But what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=558.007s">[Marks]</a>: and safety of commuters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=560.747s">[Marks]</a>: And it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=567.069s">[Marks]</a>: So hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=585.652s">[Marks]</a>: So I would ask, Mr. President, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=588.15s">[Marks]</a>: This council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=608.103s">[Marks]</a>: We may also have a resident here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=610.424s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know if Barney's here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=612.765s">[Marks]</a>: She said she was going to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=614.233s">[Marks]</a>: And if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1012.711s">[Marks]</a>: Just if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Meffitt, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1027.518s">[Marks]</a>: And we all pay for it as riders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1029.659s">[Marks]</a>: We pay through the sales tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1032.74s">[Marks]</a>: There's a percent that goes towards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1034.717s">[Marks]</a>: the operation of transit in this state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1038.742s">[Marks]</a>: And I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1047.093s">[Marks]</a>: That money comes right off our cherry sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1049.376s">[Marks]</a>: So it's money that goes right out of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1051.498s">[Marks]</a>: the city coffers, and it's based on services they're providing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1056.082s">[Marks]</a>: And I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1069.213s">[Marks]</a>: this shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1073.594s">[Marks]</a>: In the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1082.937s">[Marks]</a>: You know, I think the T has to do a better job, Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scott Pelly, that we get a quick response to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1095.08s">[Marks]</a>: And also, Mr. President, based on the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1097.677s">[Marks]</a>: We're one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1105.438s">[Marks]</a>: I like John Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1107.057s">[Marks]</a>: take the bus every day also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1109.118s">[Marks]</a>: But I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1116.361s">[Marks]</a>: We're paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1128.567s">[Marks]</a>: And I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1161.617s">[Marks]</a>: Roll call vote, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1988.344s">[Marks]</a>: Vice President Mox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1990.145s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1992.072s">[Marks]</a>: I can't support this resolution tonight based on the fact that I agree with my colleagues that this is something that hasn't been approved by the council as of yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2000.641s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm not going to partake in something that is going to tell residents that they can get out of something that the council is going to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2009.05s">[Marks]</a>: Um, and in my opinion, what we should do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2012.492s">[Marks]</a>: and I've stated this from day one, Mr. President is, uh, the energy and environment committee where this was sent at one point in this process, um, had a public hearing on it and we asked the city solicitor to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2025.499s">[Marks]</a>: And one of the questions, and it was actually my question was whether or not we can file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which, uh, is everyone is opted into the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2040.106s">[Marks]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2041.969s">[Marks]</a>: automatically and change it so you can opt into the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2049.54s">[Marks]</a>: And according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2056.856s">[Marks]</a>: at the statehouse and they believe that we could file a home loan petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2061.641s">[Marks]</a>: And that is my number one concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2064.564s">[Marks]</a>: In my opinion, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company, not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Meffitt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2076.056s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2080.139s">[Marks]</a>: I realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2085.984s">[Marks]</a>: I realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit to by aggregating everyone together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2092.289s">[Marks]</a>: And so I realize what the intent is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2096.313s">[Marks]</a>: But I, as one member of the council, don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2103.879s">[Marks]</a>: And if this is such a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2106.121s">[Marks]</a>: It's going to be overwhelming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2107.182s">[Marks]</a>: People will be knocking on the door here at City Hall to get involved and say, I want to opt into that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2113.866s">[Marks]</a>: Let the program work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2115.707s">[Marks]</a>: Let the program work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2116.968s">[Marks]</a>: So that would be my recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2119.005s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2130.368s">[Marks]</a>: Maybe it wasn't a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2131.648s">[Marks]</a>: Maybe it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2141.95s">[Marks]</a>: That's why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2145.572s">[Marks]</a>: I don't believe that should be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2147.473s">[Marks]</a>: I believe we should give residents of this community an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2151.115s">[Marks]</a>: If they want to opt into the program, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2154.136s">[Marks]</a>: You can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2161.6s">[Marks]</a>: There's also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2171.722s">[Marks]</a>: And you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2184.573s">[Marks]</a>: Now that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2188.336s">[Marks]</a>: And you can opt out of that also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2190.737s">[Marks]</a>: But now you say you can opt out of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2192.839s">[Marks]</a>: And if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2199.244s">[Marks]</a>: That's be up front with the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2200.865s">[Marks]</a>: Let them choose whether they want to partake in this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2204.628s">[Marks]</a>: And I could support that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2206.25s">[Marks]</a>: So I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2626.032s">[Marks]</a>: Was there a number six on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2636.291s">[Marks]</a>: No, I, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2637.752s">[Marks]</a>: I thought a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2638.372s">[Marks]</a>: Yeah, no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken, as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2654.821s">[Marks]</a>: And we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2658.803s">[Marks]</a>: And I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2661.324s">[Marks]</a>: We can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth, but it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2677.292s">[Marks]</a>: Last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2684.349s">[Marks]</a>: Okay, so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2696.876s">[Marks]</a>: When we ask,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2709.005s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, Eversource was before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2710.626s">[Marks]</a>: We asked Eversource to produce some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2762.332s">[Marks]</a>: But we may not get that information before next Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2766.474s">[Marks]</a>: This issue is coming up again, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2767.894s">[Marks]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2768.875s">[Marks]</a>: So we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2775.997s">[Marks]</a>: That's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2782.12s">[Marks]</a>: That's why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2902.807s">[Marks]</a>: Vice President Mox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2904.088s">[Marks]</a>: I appreciate Councilman Light sharing that information and knowing that any approval comes before the mayor and also the council as a two-pronged approach, it would be very helpful maybe in future projects<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2917.523s">[Marks]</a>: that the administration sit down with this council and say, you know, we're crafting an MOU, memorandum of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2924.607s">[Marks]</a>: You have partial approval of the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2928.43s">[Marks]</a>: What are your thoughts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2929.871s">[Marks]</a>: And that would have been helpful, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2931.672s">[Marks]</a>: So now we're after the fact negotiating with the utility company that has already entered into an agreement with the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2939.586s">[Marks]</a>: And in my opinion, I think we have every authority, otherwise it would be just a rubber stamp body just approving things to put conditions on this, Mr. President, that make sense to the rate payers and the tax payers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2954.762s">[Marks]</a>: When you have a project coming into a city that has zero benefit to this community, I say zero benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2963.277s">[Marks]</a>: and 100% disruption, I think we have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2969.262s">[Marks]</a>: So I look forward to speaking with the city solicitor on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3063.816s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3065.756s">[Marks]</a>: As the financial steward of this community, as we are as a body, and the mayor is coming before us requesting $200,000 of taxpayers' money, I would ask that the administration answer a few questions regarding this money, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3085.9s">[Marks]</a>: Well, if the administration appears before the podium, Mr. President, I'd be more than happy to relay my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3102.691s">[Marks]</a>: So the mayor is presenting a paper, Mr. President, a financial paper, and not one person could take the time out of their schedule to come up before the council to answer a question regarding taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3118.485s">[Marks]</a>: I just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3121.237s">[Marks]</a>: that not one person from the city administration was here last week, and they had ample opportunity because it was tabled for a week, or here tonight, Mr. President, to answer one question on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3135.049s">[Marks]</a>: But, Mr. President, I still will ask my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3140.549s">[Marks]</a>: I posed last week, and many of them, as representatives from the Brooks Estates quite eloquently stated, is not under the ability wig to answer why we don't have a capital plan in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3155.857s">[Marks]</a>: And I can appreciate the fact that representatives from the Brooks Estates, all volunteers that have been doing tremendous work to keep that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3164.551s">[Marks]</a>: building and the carriage house afloat for so many years, and actually moved towards the rehabilitation of the manor and the property, have done great work, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3179.258s">[Marks]</a>: My concern, and I reiterated this last week, is not with the Brooks Estates, is not with shoring up a building that I witnessed just recently as a building that's on the verge of collapse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3192.664s">[Marks]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3193.783s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think anyone else could go over into that area or that building and say this building is not going to come down very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3200.767s">[Marks]</a>: I think we all agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3202.247s">[Marks]</a>: My concern, Mr President, is why don't we have a game plan in this community on capital improvement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3210.571s">[Marks]</a>: This is one issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3213.373s">[Marks]</a>: There are a laundry list of issues that we need a capital plan for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3219.114s">[Marks]</a>: Last week, I mentioned the fire departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3222.455s">[Marks]</a>: Each fire station has dire need, Mr. President, for upgrades and renovation in the fire stations where our brave men and women spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3236.175s">[Marks]</a>: That is one aspect that needs a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3239.676s">[Marks]</a>: We're not going to be able to do that work within the confines of our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3243.677s">[Marks]</a>: And I think we can all appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3246.678s">[Marks]</a>: Over the last several years, every member of this council has spoken about the poor condition of our sidewalks and our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3255.72s">[Marks]</a>: And based on over the years, that information, this city has put zero dollars for road replacement in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3267.126s">[Marks]</a>: $0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3268.727s">[Marks]</a>: The only money we get for road replacement is through Chapter 90 money through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3273.789s">[Marks]</a>: It's about $980,000 a year, which is not going to be enough to start even remotely replacing and repaving the streets we know we need in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3285.616s">[Marks]</a>: We're never going to get ahead of the game in the way we're doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3289.118s">[Marks]</a>: We need a capital plan to address roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3294.278s">[Marks]</a>: We have yet to get any capital plan regarding roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3298.74s">[Marks]</a>: We talk about tree stumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3301.541s">[Marks]</a>: Do we have to bring up the list again of tree stumps in this community that we just either don't have the will to take them out or don't have the funding to take them out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3310.944s">[Marks]</a>: It's one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3312.705s">[Marks]</a>: I would hope it's the funding and not the will to take these out, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3317.366s">[Marks]</a>: But that's another capital plan we need to move forward on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3320.908s">[Marks]</a>: Catch basins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3322.878s">[Marks]</a>: Talk to the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3324.639s">[Marks]</a>: Go down any street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3327.161s">[Marks]</a>: I'd venture to say, and this is just off the top of my head, 50 to 60% of our catch basins that are capturing rain runoff water and taking it out to the Mystic River are imploding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3340.49s">[Marks]</a>: And they're sinking into the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3343.712s">[Marks]</a>: We're not addressing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3345.053s">[Marks]</a>: It needs to be a capital issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3347.665s">[Marks]</a>: It needs to be a capital issue that we have to move forward to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3350.607s">[Marks]</a>: Traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3352.749s">[Marks]</a>: We just had a meeting about the revitalization of Method Square and the master plan, much of which calls for traffic calming plans on main street and high street and Salem street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3365.9s">[Marks]</a>: We have many other streets in this community, upwards of 600 streets in this community that need the same traffic calming approaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3375.009s">[Marks]</a>: But yet, we put nothing in the budget, or very little, I should say, to address these very important pedestrian safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3383.472s">[Marks]</a>: We need a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3385.533s">[Marks]</a>: We're moving forward on a new library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3387.253s">[Marks]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3388.074s">[Marks]</a>: We'll probably need a capital plan for that, a portion of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3391.775s">[Marks]</a>: You know, we're moving forward on a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3393.976s">[Marks]</a>: We're probably gonna need some type of capital plan moving forward on the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3400.742s">[Marks]</a>: There are a lot of issues that we need a direction from this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3406.165s">[Marks]</a>: The easy way out is to keep on allowing this administration to sit back and not give us a capital plan and take each issue one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3420.192s">[Marks]</a>: That's our vision for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3422.253s">[Marks]</a>: When there's a need, we'll take the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3424.474s">[Marks]</a>: The carriage house is going to fall down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3426.676s">[Marks]</a>: Let's take some money out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3428.477s">[Marks]</a>: We'll repair that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3429.687s">[Marks]</a>: We'll wait till the next emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3431.47s">[Marks]</a>: We'll take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3433.594s">[Marks]</a>: If we don't have a game plan in this community, we're never going to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3437.681s">[Marks]</a>: We're never going to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3439.901s">[Marks]</a>: And whether this is the carriage house or any other issue in this community, I've preached about this for years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3446.464s">[Marks]</a>: And members of this council, I think, can agree that we've all asked for capital plans over the last several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3452.447s">[Marks]</a>: And there have been few in coming by the last administration and this current administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3458.23s">[Marks]</a>: So I'm not going to continue to work piecemeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3461.992s">[Marks]</a>: If we want to ask the administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3466.53s">[Marks]</a>: To start looking at some of the needs we have in this community, I think we have to put our foot down at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3472.372s">[Marks]</a>: The easy thing is just to prove everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3474.772s">[Marks]</a>: We have over $8 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3477.713s">[Marks]</a>: The coffers are open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3479.474s">[Marks]</a>: Just keep on approving it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3480.794s">[Marks]</a>: That's the least resistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3482.274s">[Marks]</a>: That's just to prove everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3483.515s">[Marks]</a>: But guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3484.355s">[Marks]</a>: Someday, those coffers are going to be closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3487.036s">[Marks]</a>: Times aren't going to be as good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3488.276s">[Marks]</a>: We're not going to have a reserve of $8 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3491.937s">[Marks]</a>: And the decisions are going to get tougher and tougher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3494.279s">[Marks]</a>: And that's why we need to have a game plan to tackle the most important issues, the pressing issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3500.945s">[Marks]</a>: So tonight, Mr. President, I'd like to find out what is the vision for the Brooks Banner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3508.888s">[Marks]</a>: We had a group that did Yeoman's work, and we heard about it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3513.389s">[Marks]</a>: Back in 2012, they created a master plan for the Brooks Estates, and how the Brooks Estates is gonna be able to be self-sustaining and reinvest back into the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3525.613s">[Marks]</a>: And part of that vision was to use the carriage house as the economic engine, as a function hall, to generate money that we could put into road repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3539.096s">[Marks]</a>: I said this last week, and I hope people from the Brooks Estates don't get offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3543.599s">[Marks]</a>: You need a four-wheel truck to get up to the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3547.121s">[Marks]</a>: And if you make it up there in a four-wheel pickup truck, you're lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3550.563s">[Marks]</a>: That's how bad that road is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3552.924s">[Marks]</a>: It's awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3553.664s">[Marks]</a>: It needs over a million and a half dollars of repair and underground utility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3559.408s">[Marks]</a>: There's a lot of work that needs to take place up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3562.209s">[Marks]</a>: What's the vision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3563.73s">[Marks]</a>: We were presented with the vision in 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3565.791s">[Marks]</a>: And what did this council do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3569.841s">[Marks]</a>: We sat on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3571.561s">[Marks]</a>: Five years later, now we're talking about buckling up the carriage house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3576.422s">[Marks]</a>: Let's put an envelope over it and let it sit there for another five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3581.403s">[Marks]</a>: That's our vision for the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3583.563s">[Marks]</a>: That's what we're doing for historic preservation in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3589.164s">[Marks]</a>: Let's bring the plan out again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3591.325s">[Marks]</a>: Let's discuss the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3593.005s">[Marks]</a>: Let's see what our direction is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3595.945s">[Marks]</a>: If it's the druthers of this council not to approve the plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3600.106s">[Marks]</a>: again or not to ask for additional information, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3605.691s">[Marks]</a>: But to wait five years and then put a band-aid approach to just putting a capsule over the building, yes, it will preserve the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3614.038s">[Marks]</a>: But we're still in the same spot we were, Mr. President, the same spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3618.282s">[Marks]</a>: We're not moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3620.084s">[Marks]</a>: As Mr. Lincoln eloquently said last week, this is a city-owned building, no different than Chevalier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3629.397s">[Marks]</a>: The city has to step up to the plate and take ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3633.758s">[Marks]</a>: And ownership is not putting a band-aid on a much larger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3637.86s">[Marks]</a>: So that would be my question to the mayor, or if your staff was here, what's the vision for the building for future use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3646.578s">[Marks]</a>: Do you have the same vision that the Brooks Estates has?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3649.72s">[Marks]</a>: Completely restore two buildings, the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House for public benefit, restore historic landscape, open space, natural habitat, capture the historic look and feel, promote biodiversity, improve habitat values, create the necessary economic engine to ensure long-term self-sufficiency of the property?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3670.874s">[Marks]</a>: Is that the mayor's goal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3673.916s">[Marks]</a>: That's what I'd like to know, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3675.681s">[Marks]</a>: We're putting $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3677.566s">[Marks]</a>: Is that the mayor's goal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3679.049s">[Marks]</a>: Is the mayor going to come up with a capital plan that includes the Brooks estates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3684.175s">[Marks]</a>: These are the questions I think we, as the financial stewards in this community, should be asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3689.94s">[Marks]</a>: And the quick knee-jerk reaction, I've talked to a lot of people, I got a lot of emails, Tommy did a great job, got a lot of emails from residents of this community, and actually it enlightened me on a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3701.71s">[Marks]</a>: And I found myself, which many residents said, that's compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3707.015s">[Marks]</a>: We need to secure the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3708.676s">[Marks]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3710.145s">[Marks]</a>: You know, we had a member of this council five years ago that said, let's tear down the building and build a new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3718.109s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, that was the thought five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3722.091s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know how they're going to vote now, but maybe they have a change in heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3727.053s">[Marks]</a>: But I would ask Mr. President that this be a condition on the paper that the city administration present the council within the next six months<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3740.129s">[Marks]</a>: After approval tonight, a capital plan addressing the city needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3745.011s">[Marks]</a>: You will have my vote tonight if we can get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3748.132s">[Marks]</a>: I think that's a simple request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3750.713s">[Marks]</a>: We can move ahead with the $200,000, and we're asking as a council, which we should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3756.095s">[Marks]</a>: I think that should be unanimous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3758.056s">[Marks]</a>: Madam Mayor, present us with a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3760.957s">[Marks]</a>: You have six months to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3763.898s">[Marks]</a>: Present us with a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3765.239s">[Marks]</a>: Let us know your directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3766.759s">[Marks]</a>: Let us know if it includes the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3769.551s">[Marks]</a>: because these are the decisions we have to make as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3774.136s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm prepared to make a decision either way tonight, but I thought if the people I spoke with that sent me emails and through my phone conversations, that this would be a great compromise to move the paper forward and also have an understanding that, Madam Mayor, we're gonna hold your feet to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3792.691s">[Marks]</a>: We're going to make sure you're accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3794.392s">[Marks]</a>: You may not want to come out with a list of things that you want to accomplish, because then we can measure you by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3801.636s">[Marks]</a>: So you may not want that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3803.457s">[Marks]</a>: But guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3804.578s">[Marks]</a>: We as a city need to have that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3807.199s">[Marks]</a>: We need that to move issues forward in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3810.441s">[Marks]</a>: So that would be my condition on this paper, Mr. President, that the administration present the council within the next six months, after approval tonight, a capital plan addressing all city needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3847.412s">[Marks]</a>: It's not a condition to spend your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3849.032s">[Marks]</a>: It's a condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3850.693s">[Marks]</a>: If I could have my mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3854.685s">[Marks]</a>: This is first of all a financial paper and the council has purview over whether we approve it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3860.429s">[Marks]</a>: So we can put a condition on any paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3863.291s">[Marks]</a>: Secondly, we do it all the time with the utility companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3866.394s">[Marks]</a>: When they come in and they ask us to do work and open our streets up and they only want to repave the little area that they do work on, we put conditions of approval based on the fact that they have to do curb to curb restoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3880.12s">[Marks]</a>: So we put conditions all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3881.941s">[Marks]</a>: This is no different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3882.781s">[Marks]</a>: I had a conversation with the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3885.283s">[Marks]</a>: I won't speak for him, but this is no different than any other paper requesting us to approve something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3891.486s">[Marks]</a>: We're saying we will approve this, but you also have to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3895.568s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't think there's any problem putting a condition as I just mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3900.01s">[Marks]</a>: So you want a vision for the whole city or just the Brooks Manor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3905.152s">[Marks]</a>: Capital plan addressing the entire city's needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3907.954s">[Marks]</a>: Capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4733.892s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4734.953s">[Marks]</a>: I apologize, I have not had an opportunity to read the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4740.962s">[Marks]</a>: I'm hoping it'll be my New Year's resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4784.795s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4789.537s">[Marks]</a>: I just want to thank Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4790.978s">[Marks]</a>: Over this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, we had a very important democratic moment in this community where we had a recount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4799.865s">[Marks]</a>: And there were many, many volunteers that spent eight to nine hours on both Saturday and Sunday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4806.43s">[Marks]</a>: And I just want to thank all the volunteers that allowed this process to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4811.835s">[Marks]</a>: And I want to thank this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4815.077s">[Marks]</a>: for being a great city to live in, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=248.715s">[Marks]</a>: I would just add that where the CPA now is in effect in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=253.36s">[Marks]</a>: and one of the options for the CPA money that's available is affordable housing, that that also be looked at, Mr. President, to see what funding is available to assist in low to moderate and affordable housing within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1310.682s">[Marks]</a>: Counselor Mox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1311.823s">[Marks]</a>: And I hate to interrupt you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1313.563s">[Marks]</a>: It'd be helpful if you can point out timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1317.085s">[Marks]</a>: When was it brought to the principal's office as you make your presentation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1321.327s">[Marks]</a>: Happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1322.067s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1901.095s">[Marks]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Mox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1903.537s">[Marks]</a>: Just if I could, Mr. Superintendent, two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1906.519s">[Marks]</a>: The decision that was made that this wasn't a serious incident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1910.285s">[Marks]</a>: Who else was in consultation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1912.006s">[Marks]</a>: Was the chief of police involved in this conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1938.911s">[Marks]</a>: Okay, and my other point was, at the beginning of your speech, you mentioned that the clip, the magazine clip, potentially had three to four bullets, which is pretty specific to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1950.961s">[Marks]</a>: And at any point, did you receive a picture of this, even though the principal stated he did not have the clip, or doesn't recall ever seeing the clip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1962.471s">[Marks]</a>: At what point did you see the clip itself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2001.211s">[Marks]</a>: So in your opinion, you just mentioned that you want to make the public feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2005.899s">[Marks]</a>: And in your opinion, finding a magazine clip in a K through 8 school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2013.137s">[Marks]</a>: doesn't rise to the nature of seriousness to notify local police department, notify faculty, notify parents, notify students that there is an investigation that is gonna take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2028.304s">[Marks]</a>: You didn't even feel it was at that level where you notify people in the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2039.27s">[Marks]</a>: That's debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2042.112s">[Marks]</a>: We've had a bomb incident, Mr. Superintendent, that your own school committee created a policy where serious incidents had to be reported immediately by the administration, which clearly wasn't followed in this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2075.931s">[Marks]</a>: There's no debate, Mr. Superintendent, when you find a magazine, Mr. Superintendent, that there is a concern within a building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2087.799s">[Marks]</a>: There's no debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2088.879s">[Marks]</a>: I don't see how you can say that it didn't rise to that particular level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2092.602s">[Marks]</a>: I would question your judgment if you honestly believe that that doesn't rise to a level where you should be notifying at least public safety officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2106.654s">[Marks]</a>: And I say with all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, because we've known each other for a lot of years, but I really don't see how that doesn't rise to a level in this day and age that people should be notified, especially after the incidences that we've had in this community where there's been a lack of notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2125.105s">[Marks]</a>: I thought we were past that stage and the best policy is 100% notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2131.332s">[Marks]</a>: and then let the administrators and the police do what they have to do, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2135.536s">[Marks]</a>: So I'd like to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2136.676s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4069.664s">[Marks]</a>: Counselor Mox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4071.404s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4072.945s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, in my opinion, it's clear that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4078.217s">[Marks]</a>: if this wasn't brought to certain people's attention in the community, this would have never came out in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4087.12s">[Marks]</a>: That's my own feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4089.361s">[Marks]</a>: And again, we can talk about best practices, we could talk about additional funding for cameras, we could talk about new policies and procedures, and all that can be negated by one bad judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4104.284s">[Marks]</a>: All that, any policies and procedures in place can all be negated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4108.145s">[Marks]</a>: And I think that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4109.685s">[Marks]</a>: I do think we have policies and procedures in place that weren't followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4113.746s">[Marks]</a>: And I know you take responsibility now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4117.127s">[Marks]</a>: You mentioned about coordinated and uncoordinated efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4121.288s">[Marks]</a>: I would consider what took place an uncoordinated effort internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4126.049s">[Marks]</a>: Would you not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4134.394s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think that was full coordination, but clearly part of part of coordination is notification, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4145.377s">[Marks]</a>: My other point, and I'm not a Johnny come lately on the issue is year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4150.079s">[Marks]</a>: I've been questioning you regarding the rentals of our school buildings, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4155.991s">[Marks]</a>: And year after year, we've had debates, many at this podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4160.536s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm not going to rehash all the different debates, but I do feel strongly, Mr. Superintendent, you promised me you'd look into this, that many of our buildings are rented out to outside organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4174.511s">[Marks]</a>: that have no affiliation with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4177.273s">[Marks]</a>: We do no background checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4179.214s">[Marks]</a>: We have no idea who are entering, exiting, what they're bringing into these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4184.818s">[Marks]</a>: And in my opinion, when it's mentioned to you, you kind of shrug it off and say, well, we can't crawl up and hide in a ball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4196.346s">[Marks]</a>: We rent our buildings out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4197.847s">[Marks]</a>: And I can appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4199.508s">[Marks]</a>: But the safety and security of our children and our faculty should come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4204.831s">[Marks]</a>: And if it comes to telling a program that they're no longer welcome back in this community because we choose not to rent out our buildings to make an additional 25 or 30 grand a year, which is a pittance, to be quite honest with you, in the scheme of a city budget, to me would lend a lot more peace of mind to parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4225.575s">[Marks]</a>: We've had this discussion about the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4227.896s">[Marks]</a>: After 3 o'clock, we don't have one security person on at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4234.071s">[Marks]</a>: After three o'clock, as you know, there's extracurricular activities, there's after school programs, and there's not one person at the high school that's there for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4244.355s">[Marks]</a>: I don't count custodians, I know you do, for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4248.216s">[Marks]</a>: I don't count having faculty around that they're security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4252.938s">[Marks]</a>: And I think that's a real breach of a safe and secure building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4257.92s">[Marks]</a>: And I just can't see why you can't see that, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4261.559s">[Marks]</a>: And again, it concerns me about a lack of judgment when it comes to having people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4267.44s">[Marks]</a>: We don't know what they're bringing into these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4269.921s">[Marks]</a>: We really don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4270.741s">[Marks]</a>: In this day and age, Mr. Superintendent, I think it's best to err on the side of safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4275.422s">[Marks]</a>: And I know you mentioned about Cub Scouts, and that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4278.723s">[Marks]</a>: And we don't want to make Cub Scouts not come into our building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4281.563s">[Marks]</a>: I'm talking about outside organizations that have no city affiliation, that you don't know who's going in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4290.839s">[Marks]</a>: Chief of Police doesn't know who's entering these buildings, and we don't know what they're doing inside these buildings, but they do have access to classrooms, to auditoriums, to cafeterias, and to a host of things within our building, and that's of grave concern, and something that no policy or procedure is going to cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4308.784s">[Marks]</a>: We have to take an internal approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4310.956s">[Marks]</a>: saying, is this what we really want out of our buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4313.978s">[Marks]</a>: Is it worth the public safety?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4315.599s">[Marks]</a>: Is it worth the wear and tear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4317.44s">[Marks]</a>: I don't believe so, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4319.361s">[Marks]</a>: And I don't think we could just shrug our shoulders year after year and say, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4323.383s">[Marks]</a>: We've had no incidences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4324.444s">[Marks]</a>: We're doing fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4325.885s">[Marks]</a>: This could have been an incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4327.606s">[Marks]</a>: If you found some flour, sugar, and frosting underneath the seat in the auditorium, you would say they're baking a cake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4335.05s">[Marks]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4336.051s">[Marks]</a>: But you find a magazine with bullets, and you don't think there's any serious nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4340.414s">[Marks]</a>: That there's no affiliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4352.782s">[Marks]</a>: I really believe, Mr. Superintendent, that someone needs to be held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4357.455s">[Marks]</a>: Someone needs to be held.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4359.158s">[Marks]</a>: You don't want to discuss particular personnel matters, and I agree, this is not the forum to discuss it, but someone needs to be held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4367.209s">[Marks]</a>: How can you be cleaning your office the day after this took place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4371.004s">[Marks]</a>: take a magazine off the shelf and say, oh, this doesn't look like my pocket pen or this doesn't, and discard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4380.567s">[Marks]</a>: How does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4381.868s">[Marks]</a>: Unless your office is a filthy mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4385.609s">[Marks]</a>: I don't understand how that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4387.23s">[Marks]</a>: I really don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4389.018s">[Marks]</a>: And even if it does look like a cell phone, how many people throw cell phones out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4393.322s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, I just don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4395.645s">[Marks]</a>: It seems to me the perfect, and I hate to use the words, the perfect coverup to something that should have been reported immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4409.991s">[Marks]</a>: We're not here to alarm people, I agree with you, but having administrators, having faculty, having parents, having them make that decision whether this is serious or not, whether they want to send their kids to school, is up to them, Mr. Superintendent, and not up to you making an individual, standalone decision on whether you think it rises to an area of such seriousness that people should be aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4434.549s">[Marks]</a>: I really am very disappointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4437.45s">[Marks]</a>: I have to say, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're stepping down soon and I wish you well in your retirement, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4447.853s">[Marks]</a>: I'm very disappointed that it's taken seven weeks to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4451.744s">[Marks]</a>: into the public and just barely come out, and only because I think people found out about it and raised awareness that it came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4460.31s">[Marks]</a>: Otherwise, I think it would have been brushed under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4462.832s">[Marks]</a>: And it would lead me to believe what else is being brushed under the rug that we should be aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4614.943s">[Marks]</a>: Well, I don't think it's enough responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4617.103s">[Marks]</a>: But needless to say, at the beginning of your speech, you made mention, and you referenced it, that that building was rented prior to what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4626.725s">[Marks]</a>: And I believe you mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4627.986s">[Marks]</a>: And you can correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4630.286s">[Marks]</a>: You mentioned that to allude that this was probably brought in from somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4635.687s">[Marks]</a>: This wasn't a student bringing it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4637.928s">[Marks]</a>: This was probably someone that came into our building through a rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4642.709s">[Marks]</a>: Is that not correct, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4653.182s">[Marks]</a>: So that leads you to believe that we should be looking at who's renting our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4658.405s">[Marks]</a>: Shouldn't that lead you to believe that we do need security, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4663.828s">[Marks]</a>: Do you have security when you rent these buildings there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4672.752s">[Marks]</a>: I'm talking about the McGlynn schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4674.413s">[Marks]</a>: There's security there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4691.32s">[Marks]</a>: We could talk as we've done in the past few years until we're blue in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4695.103s">[Marks]</a>: We just don't see eye to eye on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4697.445s">[Marks]</a>: And I hope it never amounts to anything other than just talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4700.447s">[Marks]</a>: But I think we need to take a serious look at, Mr. President, our rentals, which the superintendent told me for the last, I think, four or five budget periods that it's being looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.334s">[Marks]</a>: Is it being looked at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4713.954s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4714.594s">[Marks]</a>: Maybe it's being looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4729.799s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8982.222s">[Marks]</a>: Yes, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8983.703s">[Marks]</a>: Paper of Council Resolution 17-795 was a proposed amendment to Chapter 94, Article 2, Division 1, relative to the expanded notification of certain public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8995.065s">[Marks]</a>: We received the response back in our packet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8997.475s">[Marks]</a>: from the Community Development Board dated February 12th, 2018, and I would ask that a Committee of the Whole meeting be set up to discuss this particular response from Community Development Board, and this be a paper review referred to Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9025.933s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, we received correspondence from the city solicitor in our packet tonight, dated February 16th, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9034.319s">[Marks]</a>: It's to Mayor Burke from Mark Rumley regarding Council Paper 18041, request for an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9043.665s">[Marks]</a>: This was, I won't read the whole thing, this was a request of opinion from Council and Knight regarding has the Board of Health exceeded their authority with the regulatory passage of a smoking ban in private clubs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9055.934s">[Marks]</a>: where an exemption for smoking ban on private clubs is outlined in the city ordinance 58-43.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9062.999s">[Marks]</a>: The correspondence that we received back from the city solicitor stated that he believes that the Board of Health, and I'm not speaking on his behalf, this is how I interpret it, that he believes the Board of Health did exceed their authority in the passage of that smoking ban<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9085.356s">[Marks]</a>: and what he refers to membership associations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9089.259s">[Marks]</a>: And I would ask that this paper, because we were supposed to be following up on this, be referred either to a committee of the whole or some, be open to a subcommittee, whatever the council feels fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9107.133s">[Marks]</a>: And if there's any, I think we have someone that'd like to speak on it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9565.977s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9567.558s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, in the spirit of cooperation, uh, as part of paper 18 0 dash, uh, 0 4 1, there was a B paper and I had a re recent discussion after the city solicitor issued his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9580.465s">[Marks]</a>: And if anyone recalls the B paper was requesting that, uh, these particular service clubs, or if you want to refer to them as membership associations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9589.04s">[Marks]</a>: have a dedicated smoking area and we asked that as a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9593.626s">[Marks]</a>: In my discussion with the city solicitor, he thought it would be wise to put some language within our city ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9601.989s">[Marks]</a>: is requesting that member associations have an alternative, which would be a dedicated smoking area within their facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9611.994s">[Marks]</a>: And as Councilor Knight mentioned, that would be up to the membership to decide where, when, and if they want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9618.857s">[Marks]</a>: But I think that's appropriate that we have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9624.28s">[Marks]</a>: It's a matter of crafting really a sentence<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9626.949s">[Marks]</a>: of language into the city ordinance of 58-43.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9631.591s">[Marks]</a>: And I think it would, in my opinion, solve all problems for members that feel they have the right to smoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9638.093s">[Marks]</a>: And they do have the right to smoke, in my opinion, but in a dedicated area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9642.635s">[Marks]</a>: Like any other establishment, we all have workplaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9646.376s">[Marks]</a>: There's areas even here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9648.437s">[Marks]</a>: You can't smoke anywhere around the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9650.457s">[Marks]</a>: You can't even smoke outside the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9652.618s">[Marks]</a>: There's a dedicated area across about 30 feet from City Hall where is the dedicated smoking area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9659.499s">[Marks]</a>: And I think that would suit well for Captain Brennan and some of the concerns he raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9664.3s">[Marks]</a>: Those numbers that he's mentioning are alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9667.241s">[Marks]</a>: And that's only one particular establishment they're alarming of the number of cases of cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9672.698s">[Marks]</a>: and people that frequent these particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9675.72s">[Marks]</a>: So I would ask that this correspondence from the mayor be sent to a committee of the whole meeting and to discuss the dedicated smoking area and membership associations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9742.577s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I would also ask that as far as I know, I know the city solicitor did an opinion, but as far as I know, these particular organizations in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9752.426s">[Marks]</a>: have not received any formal correspondence from the city, whether it's the Board of Health or from the city clerk's office, and I think it's only appropriate to let them know what the opinion is, and if truly they are allowed to smoke now in the building, they should be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9769.719s">[Marks]</a>: And it'll be up to the council to get together on this and try and iron out something that's amendable to all parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9798.673s">[Marks]</a>: Right, but he's more or less saying if you were stopping people from smoking there now, you can't do that according to his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9810.919s">[Marks]</a>: Right, and it's important that all the service organizations know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9816.103s">[Marks]</a>: I think we can solve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9817.123s">[Marks]</a>: I think with the Committee of the Whole meeting, get all the parties together, I think it's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9840.493s">[Marks]</a>: Committee to the whole, it's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9998.835s">[Marks]</a>: I've been neglecting my duties, Mr. President, even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=92.033s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=93.534s">[Marks]</a>: I offer this resolution tonight due to a meeting that I attended last Wednesday that was offered by the Memphis Police Department, and it was their monthly community meeting they have the first Wednesday of the month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=108.539s">[Marks]</a>: Myself, Councilor Lungo Kern, and Councilor Caviello were present at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=113.26s">[Marks]</a>: That particular meeting was of utmost importance because they were discussing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=119.626s">[Marks]</a>: the issue of the shooting that took place in South Bedford a few weeks prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=126.029s">[Marks]</a>: And they, at the meeting, and I won't speak on behalf of the police department, let residents know that this is an ongoing and active investigation that's taking place and that they're putting all their resources into finding out exactly what happened and that a step up in patrol was going to happen also within that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=149.028s">[Marks]</a>: as well as some recommendations that were offered by the chief about to increase lighting in certain areas in that particular vicinity, and also the fact that additional cameras within the police department would help to help solve some crime within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=171.945s">[Marks]</a>: But, Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight because at the meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=177.31s">[Marks]</a>: One of the officers spoke up and directed his comments towards members of the city council, stating that it would be helpful, because other surrounding communities do it, if they could have what I would refer to as a revolving account that's within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=195.164s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, the account, in my opinion, could be within DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=198.606s">[Marks]</a>: It could be here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=200.048s">[Marks]</a>: But to have a revolving account that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=202.401s">[Marks]</a>: Fines, when people are caught doing graffiti, fines of whatever is issued will go directly into the revolving account and can only be used for appropriation to remove graffiti within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=220.154s">[Marks]</a>: I also had the opportunity to look at some of the surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=224.644s">[Marks]</a>: And I noticed that the city of Somerville has a program which they handle similarly with an account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=234.391s">[Marks]</a>: But they take it one step further on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=237.733s">[Marks]</a>: They also offer, which I'm going to add to my paper tonight, Mr. President, is that graffiti knows no age, no sex, no orientation, no, you know, people vandalize for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=254.016s">[Marks]</a>: It was mentioned that it's done on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=257.579s">[Marks]</a>: As we know, it's done on public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=260.021s">[Marks]</a>: As we experienced, it's done in parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=263.223s">[Marks]</a>: And it's done throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=265.305s">[Marks]</a>: And the fact that someone may tag a public building, it's easy to city contacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=270.449s">[Marks]</a>: I know in the past, Mr. President, you work at the sheriff's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=274.392s">[Marks]</a>: They've been gracious enough to come out with their itty graffiti machine and clean the graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=281.257s">[Marks]</a>: But if it's done on private property, some communities have city ordinances that require homeowners to remove the graffiti within a certain amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=294.822s">[Marks]</a>: And that adds insult to injury, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=297.943s">[Marks]</a>: The fact that you're at home, someone tags the outside of your vinyl siding, and the next day you receive a call from the city saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=308.1s">[Marks]</a>: You have 10 days to remove the graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=311.661s">[Marks]</a>: You may not have the means to remove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=314.902s">[Marks]</a>: You may need to have the graffiti remain on your house for a period of time for insurance purposes and a whole issue of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=324.505s">[Marks]</a>: And why I bring this up is the city of Somerville has a contract, and it's right on their website, and I have copies if anyone wants to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=334.196s">[Marks]</a>: And it's removal of graffiti agreement and release of liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=338.437s">[Marks]</a>: And I won't read it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=339.957s">[Marks]</a>: It's a page long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=341.778s">[Marks]</a>: But it goes over the fact that if the city is willing to go onto private property and remove graffiti from the side of a home or a garage or wherever it may be, that the homeowner will hold the city free from liability, and they'll remove the graffiti at no expense to the homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=363.827s">[Marks]</a>: And I thought that's a great idea, Mr. President, to eradicate graffiti in a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=371.434s">[Marks]</a>: I know the city of Malden also, just recently in March, they introduced a new service that they provide to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=384.664s">[Marks]</a>: And they modeled it after the city of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=387.987s">[Marks]</a>: And it's modeled after the Citizens Connect smartphone application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=392.895s">[Marks]</a>: that the city of Boston currently uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=395.356s">[Marks]</a>: And Malden just started this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=398.056s">[Marks]</a>: And they stated that, as an example, if a resident sees graffiti on the street, they would normally call or email the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=407.458s">[Marks]</a>: Now a resident can simply take a picture using their smartphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=411.259s">[Marks]</a>: With one click, the request is automatically sent to the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=415.4s">[Marks]</a>: Once the graffiti is removed, the resident is notified on their smartphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=419.417s">[Marks]</a>: that the issue has been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=421.959s">[Marks]</a>: They stated also in their press release, we are already seeing great results from the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=428.863s">[Marks]</a>: Since its release, we have had 576 requests to the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=433.866s">[Marks]</a>: Not all were graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=435.167s">[Marks]</a>: These are just requests to DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=438.389s">[Marks]</a>: And 543 were resolved with the balance slated for spring repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=443.913s">[Marks]</a>: That equates to 94% of all issues being resolved via the new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=449.281s">[Marks]</a>: And most were fixed within 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=452.343s">[Marks]</a>: This is a great, great application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=454.845s">[Marks]</a>: It's a great way to connect residents of this community to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=460.629s">[Marks]</a>: And also, it goes on to say that they thanked, at the time, Mayor Menino and the city of Boston for their leadership on the initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=470.796s">[Marks]</a>: And also, which I found quite interesting, they thanked Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=477.682s">[Marks]</a>: for offering funding for the applications so communities could take advantage of this technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=484.164s">[Marks]</a>: So apparently there's grants or money out there that we can obtain as a community to not only have a revolving account, which is my request, but to also implement something similar to this Connect phone, smart phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=499.748s">[Marks]</a>: I know Somerville uses, I think it's 311, Smart 311, I believe it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=509.248s">[Marks]</a>: 311 to allow residents to contact the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=514.592s">[Marks]</a>: They get a response back immediately saying that their request was accepted, the date and time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=519.857s">[Marks]</a>: And then, within a period of time, they're contacted by the city with updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=525.841s">[Marks]</a>: It's just a great way of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=528.404s">[Marks]</a>: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we not only have the administration look into setting up a revolving account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=537.291s">[Marks]</a>: exclusively for the purpose of graffiti removal in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=543.893s">[Marks]</a>: We also look into this particular Citizens Connect smartphone application to allow residents the expanded means of communicating with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=557.076s">[Marks]</a>: Also, Mr. President, I received a number of e-mails because of this resolution, and one resident who asked if they can appear before the council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=567.716s">[Marks]</a>: Couldn't make it tonight, but will be before the council in the near future, is applying for a mural funding from the Meffitt Arts Council and also from the Senator Charles E. Shannon Community Safety Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=585.228s">[Marks]</a>: And from what I understand, it's going to be very similar to the mural at the Meffitt Hillside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=590.712s">[Marks]</a>: And they're looking to put a mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=592.713s">[Marks]</a>: I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, because this woman has done a lot of work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=597.623s">[Marks]</a>: But somewhere in South Bedford, they already received approval for a mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=602.025s">[Marks]</a>: And this, in my opinion, will go a long way to covering up a wall that is typically, this particular wall that she's referring to, has been tagged a number of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=614.25s">[Marks]</a>: And it will go a long way to beautifying the area and also making it less inviting for someone to come out and use that to tag Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=624.534s">[Marks]</a>: So I would ask that the paper be amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=627.082s">[Marks]</a>: to include the expansion and implementation of the Citizens Connect smartphone, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=635.165s">[Marks]</a>: And I look forward to the mayor's response on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1998.332s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1999.813s">[Marks]</a>: Counselor Max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2003.515s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2007.645s">[Marks]</a>: just read over the email that we all received, too, regarding the mayor signing the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2015.171s">[Marks]</a>: And, you know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that in the mayor's opening statement, he said the city's goal is to provide the best possible parking experience for its citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2029.201s">[Marks]</a>: And you would think, Mr. President, over the last several years that this would have been a goal of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2036.506s">[Marks]</a>: There was a spotlight, I believe it was done by Channel 5 about six months ago regarding the lack of enforcement for resident permit parking in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2047.072s">[Marks]</a>: It didn't exist at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2049.274s">[Marks]</a>: So at that point, the mayor wasn't trying to provide the best experience for citizens in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2056.458s">[Marks]</a>: He also said in his statement that the objectives of this program are to deter illegal parking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2064.192s">[Marks]</a>: to ensure timely turnover of parking spaces, to benefit and enhance the business districts, and to create a friendly environment for consumers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2073.658s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, what was asked for back in 2009 was to enforce existing signage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2084.185s">[Marks]</a>: That was the recommendation back in 2009, to enforce existing signage and be consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2092.52s">[Marks]</a>: which never took place in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2095.16s">[Marks]</a>: So if we had consistent enforcement throughout the community, there would be no need to hire an outside company from Tennessee to outsource it to Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2107.343s">[Marks]</a>: We all know the contract is based on performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2111.923s">[Marks]</a>: And that will result, not could, it will result in very aggressive ticketing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2121.761s">[Marks]</a>: it will result in aggressive ticketing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2126.505s">[Marks]</a>: So if the mayor was really intent on putting the best possible parking experience for citizens, all along, he would have provided consistent enforcement by our own in-house personnel to move these cars along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2144.278s">[Marks]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2146.399s">[Marks]</a>: However, I don't agree with hiring an outside company, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2152.183s">[Marks]</a>: It also goes along to state that one of the benefits of this particular program, and I'll quote it, it says, the chamber also acknowledged that there are several beneficial aspects of the plan, such as the user-friendly kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2172.091s">[Marks]</a>: I've been talking to residents, I've been talking to business owners throughout the community, it's a hot topic, and I haven't heard one resident so far say, you know what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2181.397s">[Marks]</a>: I don't mind getting out of my car in West Method, walking four or five car lengths, which may even be a little further because there's hydrants and there's bus stops and everything else within this community crosswalks, putting my plate in the kiosk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2201.291s">[Marks]</a>: putting my time in the kiosk, putting my money in the kiosk, and going in the West Method Spa and getting a newspaper and going back to my car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2210.438s">[Marks]</a>: I haven't heard one resident say that they feel that's a benefit, that they feel that that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2217.816s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2218.556s">[Marks]</a>: So, I'm not quite sold on the use of kiosk on the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2223.697s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know any other community in this surrounding area that use kiosk on the streets, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2230.039s">[Marks]</a>: I don't believe it's user-friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2231.879s">[Marks]</a>: And I believe, as was mentioned at our meeting a couple of weeks ago, that if you happen to be stopping in one of our business districts and you happen to have your kids with you, or you happen to be taking your elderly mother to a doctor's appointment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2246.967s">[Marks]</a>: It's not user-friendly to walk several spots to put money in a kiosk, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2253.35s">[Marks]</a>: It was also mentioned that the mayor was willing to settle or compromise with the business community in giving free spots throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2266.976s">[Marks]</a>: And that was very admirable of the mayor, but let's break it down for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2273.834s">[Marks]</a>: This plan calls for 1,000 parking spots, roughly 1,000 parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2280.376s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor, under his new proposal that he just signed, is allotting two parking spots for 30-minute free parking in five of the business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2291.0s">[Marks]</a>: So that's 10 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2292.661s">[Marks]</a>: That's 1% of the total parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2297.243s">[Marks]</a>: So this great, grandioso plan that the mayor came down and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2301.297s">[Marks]</a>: decided with the business owners who were all advocating for some sort of free parking, albeit limited free parking, but some sort of free parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2311.427s">[Marks]</a>: Now, the mayor was gracious enough to give us 10 spots citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2318.493s">[Marks]</a>: So if you happen to be in Method Square, there may be a spot down by the CVS, down by Carlene's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2326.966s">[Marks]</a>: And there may be a spot on the east side, all the way down by City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2333.01s">[Marks]</a>: Those are your two spots for free parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2336.933s">[Marks]</a>: Doesn't seem like a lot to me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2340.215s">[Marks]</a>: And I don't think it's what the business owners intended on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2345.778s">[Marks]</a>: Secondly, Mr. President, this council asked several times, and recently a couple of weeks ago, to hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2355.916s">[Marks]</a>: to allow residents, business owners, anyone interested to come up and address the council, address the mayor, address the administration, address this company from Tennessee, and the mayor refused to hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2370.104s">[Marks]</a>: He kept on going back saying, don't forget, there was a public hearing in September 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2375.167s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. Mayor, that was five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2381.926s">[Marks]</a>: Things change in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2383.807s">[Marks]</a>: There are new residents in this community over the past five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2387.269s">[Marks]</a>: There are new business owners in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2389.65s">[Marks]</a>: There are new challenges facing our residents and our business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2394.152s">[Marks]</a>: And to go based on a hearing that took place five years ago, the mayor must have his head stuck in the sand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2403.637s">[Marks]</a>: So there was no input from this council, and I speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2409.309s">[Marks]</a>: And I'd like to know if any member of this council was able to effectively make change in the mayor's proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2416.385s">[Marks]</a>: I'd like to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2418.151s">[Marks]</a>: Because every time I offered something, the mayor just poo-pooed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2422.796s">[Marks]</a>: Oh, that can't be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2423.716s">[Marks]</a>: We can't do it like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2425.238s">[Marks]</a>: This was the mayor's proposal from the start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2428.941s">[Marks]</a>: No one had any input, the business owners, nor the residents of this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2435.308s">[Marks]</a>: I know the mayor, in his statement, keeps on going back, saying the business owners and the chamber are on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2441.093s">[Marks]</a>: What about the 56,000 residents of this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2445.735s">[Marks]</a>: What input do they have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2447.436s">[Marks]</a>: They're the ones that traverse the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2449.997s">[Marks]</a>: They're the ones that go to the schools and the churches and the medical appointments in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2456.579s">[Marks]</a>: Why do they have no input, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2460.321s">[Marks]</a>: You know, I don't know why the mayor decided to craft this program in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2470.165s">[Marks]</a>: He crafted it, as he stated three weeks ago, with members of his departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2476.569s">[Marks]</a>: That who has ultimately made the final decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2480.312s">[Marks]</a>: Members of his department heads made the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2485.495s">[Marks]</a>: And then once the program went out for RFP, request for proposal, and came back, the mayor was about to sign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2493.54s">[Marks]</a>: And he thought better of it and said, let me have the council do a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2499.056s">[Marks]</a>: where business owners came down, the ones that did know about it came down, and they offered many suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2507.362s">[Marks]</a>: And I talked to a business owner tonight that was at that meeting, not gonna state his name, and he wasn't aware of the mayor just signing this, but I asked him, is that acceptable, two spots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2519.051s">[Marks]</a>: And he said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2521.754s">[Marks]</a>: And he thought he was gonna have some input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2524.977s">[Marks]</a>: And he had no input at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2526.598s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't know who the mayor met with, as Councilor Penta mentioned, but this was a decision made strictly by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2536.166s">[Marks]</a>: If the mayor was so concerned about providing such an experience for parkers in this community, why did he let resident permit parking go for so many years without enforcement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2549.537s">[Marks]</a>: But he collected the fee for the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2552.74s">[Marks]</a>: He didn't let that go, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2554.619s">[Marks]</a>: He made sure he collected the fee, but he didn't provide the enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2558.522s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor allowed people to park from Winchester and Arlington and West Bedford for years and take the commuter rail in, and take the buses in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2568.128s">[Marks]</a>: He allowed them to park in Bedford Square and Haines Square for years, Mr. President, without enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2575.273s">[Marks]</a>: So, you know, I'm not sold on this program, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2579.396s">[Marks]</a>: Councilor Caviello just mentioned the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2583.497s">[Marks]</a>: retired police officers possibly doing the role in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2588.038s">[Marks]</a>: I offered back some years ago, Mr. President, to look at having crossing guards who I spoke to the union president, said they would be more than happy to do that task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2600.681s">[Marks]</a>: They already have uniforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2602.741s">[Marks]</a>: Many of them are already trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2604.742s">[Marks]</a>: And at the time, it just fell on deaf ears to take this in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2612.711s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor went off, signed it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2614.712s">[Marks]</a>: I wish him well on this, but I wish there were more public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2620.355s">[Marks]</a>: I wish that there was more input from the community and from business owners in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2626.799s">[Marks]</a>: And I wish we had some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2627.98s">[Marks]</a>: We waited this many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2630.241s">[Marks]</a>: I wish we had some time to really sit behind the table like we did a few weeks ago and really iron out some of the differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2638.766s">[Marks]</a>: And we really didn't have that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2641.525s">[Marks]</a>: And I think the mayor fell short of the mark on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2645.647s">[Marks]</a>: And it's going to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2647.909s">[Marks]</a>: At some point, when the aggressive enforcement starts, it's going to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2652.792s">[Marks]</a>: And the mayor is going to do everything he can to hide behind the issue, like he did in this letter, stating, if you read half the letter, half it's about the council votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2665.199s">[Marks]</a>: What member behind this reel voted on the proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2668.493s">[Marks]</a>: We voted to allow the mayor to enter into a 10-year contract because of state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2675.796s">[Marks]</a>: My vote wasn't predicated on what was involved within that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2681.294s">[Marks]</a>: My vote was to allow them because all three bids came back for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2685.835s">[Marks]</a>: So at the time, the mayor presented it to us saying, I can't negotiate at all because I don't have the authority to go and negotiate anything over three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2694.658s">[Marks]</a>: You have to give me the ability to negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2697.259s">[Marks]</a>: And that's what this council did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2699.56s">[Marks]</a>: We never voted on the terms of the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2703.021s">[Marks]</a>: Not one time did we ever vote on the terms of the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2709.003s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3107.079s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3108.019s">[Marks]</a>: And I appreciate Mr. White being here on behalf of the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3112.461s">[Marks]</a>: You just mentioned that you've participated in the process all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3117.242s">[Marks]</a>: Other than the meeting we had a few weeks back, Jonathan, what other participation has the chamber had in crafting this particular proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3275.59s">[Marks]</a>: So just so I understand, if he was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3277.81s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor was consulting with the past executive director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3281.772s">[Marks]</a>: Why were so many business owners caught off guard of what actually was in the proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3287.554s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm not quite sure that I buy the fact that the chamber has had so much input in this proposal because the input really didn't take place until three and a half, four weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3303.309s">[Marks]</a>: And as you mentioned, this has been a process since 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3305.89s">[Marks]</a>: This has been an ongoing process for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3308.991s">[Marks]</a>: So I guess why all of a sudden in the last three weeks was it that the chamber was invited to the table to give input when supposedly there was open dialogue and input from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3322.274s">[Marks]</a>: the chamber for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3323.935s">[Marks]</a>: I don't understand why he took such a direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3327.298s">[Marks]</a>: If there was that much input for the last five years from the chamber, I would have think some of the issues would have been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3333.843s">[Marks]</a>: And really, the issues that I hear from business owners weren't addressed, still really aren't addressed, but weren't really talked about until three weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4278.717s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4280.879s">[Marks]</a>: For those that are not aware, there are many petitions circulating the community right now for support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4289.028s">[Marks]</a>: of a dog park in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4292.331s">[Marks]</a>: We were promised back in 2011 by the mayor that he was going to implement a dog park somewhere within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4303.719s">[Marks]</a>: And I am asking now for a complete itemization of the money that the mayor supposedly accepted from J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4313.506s">[Marks]</a>: White bridge construction, which was mitigation money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4317.578s">[Marks]</a>: back in, I believe, 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4318.939s">[Marks]</a>: And also, September 2010 was the Meffitt Jingle Bell Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4327.141s">[Marks]</a>: They had a dog show and raised money for the dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4330.942s">[Marks]</a>: Also, the Doggie Fun Run at Hormel Stadium, which was in 2013 and just recently held in 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4339.774s">[Marks]</a>: 14, and also the Boston Volunteer Solutions Incorporated donated $1,766 to develop a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4348.881s">[Marks]</a>: And I would like a complete itemized list of the different groups and organizations that have donated the money, when it was donated, and how much is in that account as it currently exists, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4406.409s">[Marks]</a>: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for those kind words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4410.55s">[Marks]</a>: And, Mr. President, you know, I recognize, and I think many people behind this reeling, because we've all supported it, the fact that there's a need in this community, the fact that we have space in this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4422.964s">[Marks]</a>: The fact that money's been raised in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4426.485s">[Marks]</a>: And I think all three combine to a reason why we need this park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4430.947s">[Marks]</a>: And I, as one person, believe that we can no longer wait for this in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4438.249s">[Marks]</a>: It was promised back three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4440.25s">[Marks]</a>: It's a great way to exercise, socialize your dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4443.771s">[Marks]</a>: People meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4444.551s">[Marks]</a>: You know, Somerville last year licensed over 7,000 dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4451.621s">[Marks]</a>: in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4452.622s">[Marks]</a>: Method licensed, I believe it was about 425, 400 dogs in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4455.826s">[Marks]</a>: So I think it shows you, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4463.848s">[Marks]</a>: When you have a community that has support for a dog park, support for initiatives like that, that people come out, they'll license their dogs, they'll get active, and that's healthy in a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4477.559s">[Marks]</a>: And I think other surrounding communities that do have dog parks, Melrose, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, Brookline, Arlington, Malden, Billerica, that have dog parks experience this, and our residents, I believe, are losing out on this experience as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4493.134s">[Marks]</a>: the need to exercise their dogs, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4542.248s">[Marks]</a>: Anyone interested in passing out petitions or putting them in businesses can contact myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4549.2s">[Marks]</a>: or, you know, maybe do it collectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4552.921s">[Marks]</a>: Any counselor, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4553.981s">[Marks]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4554.181s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, you know, we're, we're trying to organize and like Council Knight said, it's grassroots and it's very difficult to get the list of, we did get a list of everyone that pulled the dog license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4566.704s">[Marks]</a>: We're in the process of trying to contact people and eventually where the hopes are, Mr. President, that we're going to present all these petitions on a dog rally here at city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4578.061s">[Marks]</a>: And hopefully we'll have enough interest and enough participation to show the mayor that this is something, and I think the mayor agrees, but he's working slowly on it, that there's a need out there, and the need is eminent, and there's no reason to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6070.132s">[Marks]</a>: Councillor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6071.833s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I thank my Councillor colleague for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6075.116s">[Marks]</a>: And I think actually Councillor Knight hit the nail on the head on the fact that the ball's in our court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6082.502s">[Marks]</a>: And if we want to have a public hearing here, if we want to have a committee of the whole meeting, if we want to have a subcommittee meeting, I personally prefer the fact that the Water and Sewer Commission has come up before the podium, as was just stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6094.444s">[Marks]</a>: and present to us the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6096.985s">[Marks]</a>: Because honestly, I think we've all advocated for a tiered system for a number of years, and I wasn't aware that potentially they would mesh, if you live in a three-family, all three together, and then they would divide by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6112.512s">[Marks]</a>: I wasn't aware it would work that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6114.093s">[Marks]</a>: But these are the things I think that we have to listen to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6117.374s">[Marks]</a>: And regarding where the tier falls, if it's 0 to 800, or 800 to 1600,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6123.792s">[Marks]</a>: At any point you decide on, there's going to be a cutoff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6126.774s">[Marks]</a>: So if it was zero to 1,000, what about the people that are 1,001?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6132.257s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't think you can really go too much on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6135.499s">[Marks]</a>: And as was mentioned, the tier system that we push for as a council, and don't forget, the council also pushed for, and it's been implemented, a second meter outside to save on your sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6148.907s">[Marks]</a>: That was another initiative by this council pushing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6152.504s">[Marks]</a>: I think the TAD system will eventually promote, as was mentioned, conservation in the community, but also make people mindful of the fact, because the water and sewage, you feel like you have no control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6166.984s">[Marks]</a>: Let's face it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6168.335s">[Marks]</a>: You go to the restroom, you've got to flush your toilet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6170.976s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to take a shower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6171.856s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to drink water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6173.357s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to wash your lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6176.338s">[Marks]</a>: There's basic things that you need to do with water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6179.799s">[Marks]</a>: And this is the first time that someone may have control over what their bill is actually going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6186.321s">[Marks]</a>: So if you wanted to conserve and fall into a different range, then you could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6192.042s">[Marks]</a>: You'd make every effort to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6194.683s">[Marks]</a>: And I think we'll end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6197.751s">[Marks]</a>: saving as Councilor Knight mentioned in the long run, people money, save money in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6203.354s">[Marks]</a>: And the fact that we have, as Councilor Penta just mentioned, $8 million, I am shocked to hear $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6208.716s">[Marks]</a>: I know it was $6.5 million or right around $6 million not too long ago, but that account is growing exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6216.06s">[Marks]</a>: You know, every member of this Council has stated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6220.343s">[Marks]</a>: That count was never intended to be this pot of gold, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6225.269s">[Marks]</a>: It's for infrastructure improvements and to offset water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6229.755s">[Marks]</a>: And God knows we need a lot of infrastructure improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6234.704s">[Marks]</a>: You know, the water and sewer that's, the water that's seeping into our old drain pipes, our old sewer pipes, that's costing us millions of dollars to treat as raw sewage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6244.746s">[Marks]</a>: As Councilor Penton mentioned, INI, the, I mean, the leak detection program, that's also costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6254.668s">[Marks]</a>: These are the things that that $8 million should be going into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6258.488s">[Marks]</a>: We have illegal catch basins right now that are directly connected to the sewer system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6263.376s">[Marks]</a>: So when it rains, that water goes out, and it's just groundwater, and it's treated as raw sewage, costing us millions of dollars a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6272.925s">[Marks]</a>: We know where these catch basins are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6274.786s">[Marks]</a>: We have $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6276.508s">[Marks]</a>: Why aren't we doing anything to improve the infrastructure, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6280.37s">[Marks]</a>: This has been a bone of contention that I've spoken about for years, Mr. President, and now we have money sitting in a fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6288.475s">[Marks]</a>: Why don't we use it for infrastructure improvements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6290.916s">[Marks]</a>: I know some attempts have been made, and we've made some progress in that direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6296.261s">[Marks]</a>: of improving inflow and infiltration and also leak detection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6300.882s">[Marks]</a>: But at the rate we're going, we're never going to get ahead of the bell curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6304.663s">[Marks]</a>: We're never going to get ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6306.524s">[Marks]</a>: And residents are going to be looking at their bills saying, someday this is going to be more than my tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6311.905s">[Marks]</a>: And the way we're going, this is not my statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6314.526s">[Marks]</a>: It's been stated 100 times before this council that someday your water and sewer bill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6320.796s">[Marks]</a>: will be more than your taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6322.497s">[Marks]</a>: And people will be looking to point the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6325.478s">[Marks]</a>: And all they can point to that is the fact that we've done very little as a community to improve our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6332.241s">[Marks]</a>: We've done very little to improve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6334.402s">[Marks]</a>: We do take advantage of 0% finance loans every so often and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6339.164s">[Marks]</a>: But we're never going to get ahead of the hundreds of miles of pipe that exist underneath our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6346.331s">[Marks]</a>: unless we start being proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6348.433s">[Marks]</a>: Every year, take up a certain hotspot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6350.995s">[Marks]</a>: We know the hotspots are where there's a lot of leakage and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6354.359s">[Marks]</a>: We know where the hotspots are that are accepting groundwater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6357.962s">[Marks]</a>: We know where the leaks are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6359.443s">[Marks]</a>: We know where all the issues stand, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6363.047s">[Marks]</a>: However, because it's underground, you know, out of sight, out of mind, the old saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6368.132s">[Marks]</a>: You know, the administration tends to put that on the back burner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6371.34s">[Marks]</a>: And they like to have that little nest egg out there so they can say, well, our bond rating is low because we have these reserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6378.786s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think we should be using the rate payers' reserves out there if we're not going to the intended purpose, which is infrastructure improvements and to lower the rates, just to say we can get a better bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6390.355s">[Marks]</a>: That's not the intent of that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6392.847s">[Marks]</a>: And the intent is definitely not to build an $8 million surplus on your hard-earned money, Mr. President, my hard-earned money, and every other taxpayer in this community that's working to make a buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6403.433s">[Marks]</a>: We should be holding $8 million in reserve, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6406.494s">[Marks]</a>: I thank my colleague, Counselor Penta, for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.23s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.791s">[Marks]</a>: Also, in addition to the city solicitor, can we also invite the city engineer at the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7102.672s">[Marks]</a>: And did you mention Councilor Penter as the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7108.887s">[Marks]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7109.308s">[Marks]</a>: I would ask the chair then if, uh, I think you would need at least two hours in a meeting like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7114.811s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, cause I think sometimes in an hour you're hard pressed to get the questions and answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7121.076s">[Marks]</a>: And, uh, so I would ask that, uh, if my colleague would try to plan a two hour meeting on a Wednesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7145.041s">[Marks]</a>: He's a paid consultant, so I think we're going to- Well, he came up with the rates, I'm sure, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7170.804s">[Marks]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7193.07s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7194.611s">[Marks]</a>: These were two separate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7196.127s">[Marks]</a>: trip-and-fall accidents on Carolina Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7200.43s">[Marks]</a>: One, the woman was taken to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7202.711s">[Marks]</a>: She broke her nose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7204.252s">[Marks]</a>: She did some damage to her jawbone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7206.754s">[Marks]</a>: And the other woman fell down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7208.095s">[Marks]</a>: I believe had some leg damage, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7211.197s">[Marks]</a>: But both sidewalks are above, actually, the curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7217.101s">[Marks]</a>: So when you step up onto the sidewalk, you hit the lip of the sidewalk, rather than just go onto a flat plane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7226.002s">[Marks]</a>: And they really, in the interest of public safety, need to be done immediately, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8366.602s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8368.263s">[Marks]</a>: As we all know, and Jean's been very vocal over the years, Jean has been a staunch advocate of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8375.307s">[Marks]</a>: So even though her statements went in many different directions, I think where it lies with Jean is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8381.8s">[Marks]</a>: She's always been a supporter of public safety and the men and women in the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8386.142s">[Marks]</a>: Also, Mr. President, while we have her here, and I know it's getting late, but Jean has attended a meeting in Washington and has done yeoman's work on all sorts of disability issues and VA issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8401.45s">[Marks]</a>: And I'd like to hear- Councilor Mox?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8417.067s">[Marks]</a>: I just would like, Mr. President, if Jane could fill us in on her endeavors with the VA and the disabilities and what she just recently did in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8620.405s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I just would like to thank Jean on behalf of all Method residents for her work and diligence with the DAV and all the great things that she does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8631.408s">[Marks]</a>: That was very interesting to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8632.708s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Jean.<br><br>
