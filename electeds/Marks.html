    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=92.033s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=93.534s">[Marks]</a>: I offer this resolution tonight due to a meeting that I attended last Wednesday that was offered by the Memphis Police Department, and it was their monthly community meeting they have the first Wednesday of the month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=108.539s">[Marks]</a>: Myself, Councilor Lungo Kern, and Councilor Caviello were present at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=113.26s">[Marks]</a>: That particular meeting was of utmost importance because they were discussing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=119.626s">[Marks]</a>: the issue of the shooting that took place in South Bedford a few weeks prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=126.029s">[Marks]</a>: And they, at the meeting, and I won't speak on behalf of the police department, let residents know that this is an ongoing and active investigation that's taking place and that they're putting all their resources into finding out exactly what happened and that a step up in patrol was going to happen also within that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=149.028s">[Marks]</a>: as well as some recommendations that were offered by the chief about to increase lighting in certain areas in that particular vicinity, and also the fact that additional cameras within the police department would help to help solve some crime within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=171.945s">[Marks]</a>: But, Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight because at the meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=177.31s">[Marks]</a>: One of the officers spoke up and directed his comments towards members of the city council, stating that it would be helpful, because other surrounding communities do it, if they could have what I would refer to as a revolving account that's within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=195.164s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, the account, in my opinion, could be within DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=198.606s">[Marks]</a>: It could be here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=200.048s">[Marks]</a>: But to have a revolving account that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=202.401s">[Marks]</a>: Fines, when people are caught doing graffiti, fines of whatever is issued will go directly into the revolving account and can only be used for appropriation to remove graffiti within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=220.154s">[Marks]</a>: I also had the opportunity to look at some of the surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=224.644s">[Marks]</a>: And I noticed that the city of Somerville has a program which they handle similarly with an account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=234.391s">[Marks]</a>: But they take it one step further on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=237.733s">[Marks]</a>: They also offer, which I'm going to add to my paper tonight, Mr. President, is that graffiti knows no age, no sex, no orientation, no, you know, people vandalize for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=254.016s">[Marks]</a>: It was mentioned that it's done on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=257.579s">[Marks]</a>: As we know, it's done on public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=260.021s">[Marks]</a>: As we experienced, it's done in parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=263.223s">[Marks]</a>: And it's done throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=265.305s">[Marks]</a>: And the fact that someone may tag a public building, it's easy to city contacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=270.449s">[Marks]</a>: I know in the past, Mr. President, you work at the sheriff's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=274.392s">[Marks]</a>: They've been gracious enough to come out with their itty graffiti machine and clean the graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=281.257s">[Marks]</a>: But if it's done on private property, some communities have city ordinances that require homeowners to remove the graffiti within a certain amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=294.822s">[Marks]</a>: And that adds insult to injury, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=297.943s">[Marks]</a>: The fact that you're at home, someone tags the outside of your vinyl siding, and the next day you receive a call from the city saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=308.1s">[Marks]</a>: You have 10 days to remove the graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=311.661s">[Marks]</a>: You may not have the means to remove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=314.902s">[Marks]</a>: You may need to have the graffiti remain on your house for a period of time for insurance purposes and a whole issue of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=324.505s">[Marks]</a>: And why I bring this up is the city of Somerville has a contract, and it's right on their website, and I have copies if anyone wants to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=334.196s">[Marks]</a>: And it's removal of graffiti agreement and release of liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=338.437s">[Marks]</a>: And I won't read it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=339.957s">[Marks]</a>: It's a page long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=341.778s">[Marks]</a>: But it goes over the fact that if the city is willing to go onto private property and remove graffiti from the side of a home or a garage or wherever it may be, that the homeowner will hold the city free from liability, and they'll remove the graffiti at no expense to the homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=363.827s">[Marks]</a>: And I thought that's a great idea, Mr. President, to eradicate graffiti in a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=371.434s">[Marks]</a>: I know the city of Malden also, just recently in March, they introduced a new service that they provide to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=384.664s">[Marks]</a>: And they modeled it after the city of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=387.987s">[Marks]</a>: And it's modeled after the Citizens Connect smartphone application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=392.895s">[Marks]</a>: that the city of Boston currently uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=395.356s">[Marks]</a>: And Malden just started this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=398.056s">[Marks]</a>: And they stated that, as an example, if a resident sees graffiti on the street, they would normally call or email the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=407.458s">[Marks]</a>: Now a resident can simply take a picture using their smartphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=411.259s">[Marks]</a>: With one click, the request is automatically sent to the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=415.4s">[Marks]</a>: Once the graffiti is removed, the resident is notified on their smartphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=419.417s">[Marks]</a>: that the issue has been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=421.959s">[Marks]</a>: They stated also in their press release, we are already seeing great results from the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=428.863s">[Marks]</a>: Since its release, we have had 576 requests to the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=433.866s">[Marks]</a>: Not all were graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=435.167s">[Marks]</a>: These are just requests to DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=438.389s">[Marks]</a>: And 543 were resolved with the balance slated for spring repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=443.913s">[Marks]</a>: That equates to 94% of all issues being resolved via the new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=449.281s">[Marks]</a>: And most were fixed within 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=452.343s">[Marks]</a>: This is a great, great application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=454.845s">[Marks]</a>: It's a great way to connect residents of this community to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=460.629s">[Marks]</a>: And also, it goes on to say that they thanked, at the time, Mayor Menino and the city of Boston for their leadership on the initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=470.796s">[Marks]</a>: And also, which I found quite interesting, they thanked Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=477.682s">[Marks]</a>: for offering funding for the applications so communities could take advantage of this technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=484.164s">[Marks]</a>: So apparently there's grants or money out there that we can obtain as a community to not only have a revolving account, which is my request, but to also implement something similar to this Connect phone, smart phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=499.748s">[Marks]</a>: I know Somerville uses, I think it's 311, Smart 311, I believe it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=509.248s">[Marks]</a>: 311 to allow residents to contact the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=514.592s">[Marks]</a>: They get a response back immediately saying that their request was accepted, the date and time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=519.857s">[Marks]</a>: And then, within a period of time, they're contacted by the city with updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=525.841s">[Marks]</a>: It's just a great way of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=528.404s">[Marks]</a>: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we not only have the administration look into setting up a revolving account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=537.291s">[Marks]</a>: exclusively for the purpose of graffiti removal in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=543.893s">[Marks]</a>: We also look into this particular Citizens Connect smartphone application to allow residents the expanded means of communicating with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=557.076s">[Marks]</a>: Also, Mr. President, I received a number of e-mails because of this resolution, and one resident who asked if they can appear before the council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=567.716s">[Marks]</a>: Couldn't make it tonight, but will be before the council in the near future, is applying for a mural funding from the Meffitt Arts Council and also from the Senator Charles E. Shannon Community Safety Initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=585.228s">[Marks]</a>: And from what I understand, it's going to be very similar to the mural at the Meffitt Hillside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=590.712s">[Marks]</a>: And they're looking to put a mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=592.713s">[Marks]</a>: I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, because this woman has done a lot of work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=597.623s">[Marks]</a>: But somewhere in South Bedford, they already received approval for a mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=602.025s">[Marks]</a>: And this, in my opinion, will go a long way to covering up a wall that is typically, this particular wall that she's referring to, has been tagged a number of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=614.25s">[Marks]</a>: And it will go a long way to beautifying the area and also making it less inviting for someone to come out and use that to tag Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=624.534s">[Marks]</a>: So I would ask that the paper be amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=627.082s">[Marks]</a>: to include the expansion and implementation of the Citizens Connect smartphone, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=635.165s">[Marks]</a>: And I look forward to the mayor's response on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1998.332s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1999.813s">[Marks]</a>: Counselor Max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2003.515s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2007.645s">[Marks]</a>: just read over the email that we all received, too, regarding the mayor signing the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2015.171s">[Marks]</a>: And, you know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that in the mayor's opening statement, he said the city's goal is to provide the best possible parking experience for its citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2029.201s">[Marks]</a>: And you would think, Mr. President, over the last several years that this would have been a goal of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2036.506s">[Marks]</a>: There was a spotlight, I believe it was done by Channel 5 about six months ago regarding the lack of enforcement for resident permit parking in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2047.072s">[Marks]</a>: It didn't exist at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2049.274s">[Marks]</a>: So at that point, the mayor wasn't trying to provide the best experience for citizens in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2056.458s">[Marks]</a>: He also said in his statement that the objectives of this program are to deter illegal parking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2064.192s">[Marks]</a>: to ensure timely turnover of parking spaces, to benefit and enhance the business districts, and to create a friendly environment for consumers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2073.658s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, what was asked for back in 2009 was to enforce existing signage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2084.185s">[Marks]</a>: That was the recommendation back in 2009, to enforce existing signage and be consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2092.52s">[Marks]</a>: which never took place in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2095.16s">[Marks]</a>: So if we had consistent enforcement throughout the community, there would be no need to hire an outside company from Tennessee to outsource it to Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2107.343s">[Marks]</a>: We all know the contract is based on performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2111.923s">[Marks]</a>: And that will result, not could, it will result in very aggressive ticketing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2121.761s">[Marks]</a>: it will result in aggressive ticketing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2126.505s">[Marks]</a>: So if the mayor was really intent on putting the best possible parking experience for citizens, all along, he would have provided consistent enforcement by our own in-house personnel to move these cars along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2144.278s">[Marks]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2146.399s">[Marks]</a>: However, I don't agree with hiring an outside company, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2152.183s">[Marks]</a>: It also goes along to state that one of the benefits of this particular program, and I'll quote it, it says, the chamber also acknowledged that there are several beneficial aspects of the plan, such as the user-friendly kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2172.091s">[Marks]</a>: I've been talking to residents, I've been talking to business owners throughout the community, it's a hot topic, and I haven't heard one resident so far say, you know what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2181.397s">[Marks]</a>: I don't mind getting out of my car in West Method, walking four or five car lengths, which may even be a little further because there's hydrants and there's bus stops and everything else within this community crosswalks, putting my plate in the kiosk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2201.291s">[Marks]</a>: putting my time in the kiosk, putting my money in the kiosk, and going in the West Method Spa and getting a newspaper and going back to my car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2210.438s">[Marks]</a>: I haven't heard one resident say that they feel that's a benefit, that they feel that that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2217.816s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2218.556s">[Marks]</a>: So, I'm not quite sold on the use of kiosk on the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2223.697s">[Marks]</a>: I don't know any other community in this surrounding area that use kiosk on the streets, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2230.039s">[Marks]</a>: I don't believe it's user-friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2231.879s">[Marks]</a>: And I believe, as was mentioned at our meeting a couple of weeks ago, that if you happen to be stopping in one of our business districts and you happen to have your kids with you, or you happen to be taking your elderly mother to a doctor's appointment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2246.967s">[Marks]</a>: It's not user-friendly to walk several spots to put money in a kiosk, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2253.35s">[Marks]</a>: It was also mentioned that the mayor was willing to settle or compromise with the business community in giving free spots throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2266.976s">[Marks]</a>: And that was very admirable of the mayor, but let's break it down for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2273.834s">[Marks]</a>: This plan calls for 1,000 parking spots, roughly 1,000 parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2280.376s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor, under his new proposal that he just signed, is allotting two parking spots for 30-minute free parking in five of the business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2291.0s">[Marks]</a>: So that's 10 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2292.661s">[Marks]</a>: That's 1% of the total parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2297.243s">[Marks]</a>: So this great, grandioso plan that the mayor came down and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2301.297s">[Marks]</a>: decided with the business owners who were all advocating for some sort of free parking, albeit limited free parking, but some sort of free parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2311.427s">[Marks]</a>: Now, the mayor was gracious enough to give us 10 spots citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2318.493s">[Marks]</a>: So if you happen to be in Method Square, there may be a spot down by the CVS, down by Carlene's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2326.966s">[Marks]</a>: And there may be a spot on the east side, all the way down by City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2333.01s">[Marks]</a>: Those are your two spots for free parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2336.933s">[Marks]</a>: Doesn't seem like a lot to me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2340.215s">[Marks]</a>: And I don't think it's what the business owners intended on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2345.778s">[Marks]</a>: Secondly, Mr. President, this council asked several times, and recently a couple of weeks ago, to hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2355.916s">[Marks]</a>: to allow residents, business owners, anyone interested to come up and address the council, address the mayor, address the administration, address this company from Tennessee, and the mayor refused to hold a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2370.104s">[Marks]</a>: He kept on going back saying, don't forget, there was a public hearing in September 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2375.167s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. Mayor, that was five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2381.926s">[Marks]</a>: Things change in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2383.807s">[Marks]</a>: There are new residents in this community over the past five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2387.269s">[Marks]</a>: There are new business owners in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2389.65s">[Marks]</a>: There are new challenges facing our residents and our business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2394.152s">[Marks]</a>: And to go based on a hearing that took place five years ago, the mayor must have his head stuck in the sand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2403.637s">[Marks]</a>: So there was no input from this council, and I speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2409.309s">[Marks]</a>: And I'd like to know if any member of this council was able to effectively make change in the mayor's proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2416.385s">[Marks]</a>: I'd like to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2418.151s">[Marks]</a>: Because every time I offered something, the mayor just poo-pooed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2422.796s">[Marks]</a>: Oh, that can't be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2423.716s">[Marks]</a>: We can't do it like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2425.238s">[Marks]</a>: This was the mayor's proposal from the start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2428.941s">[Marks]</a>: No one had any input, the business owners, nor the residents of this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2435.308s">[Marks]</a>: I know the mayor, in his statement, keeps on going back, saying the business owners and the chamber are on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2441.093s">[Marks]</a>: What about the 56,000 residents of this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2445.735s">[Marks]</a>: What input do they have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2447.436s">[Marks]</a>: They're the ones that traverse the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2449.997s">[Marks]</a>: They're the ones that go to the schools and the churches and the medical appointments in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2456.579s">[Marks]</a>: Why do they have no input, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2460.321s">[Marks]</a>: You know, I don't know why the mayor decided to craft this program in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2470.165s">[Marks]</a>: He crafted it, as he stated three weeks ago, with members of his departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2476.569s">[Marks]</a>: That who has ultimately made the final decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2480.312s">[Marks]</a>: Members of his department heads made the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2485.495s">[Marks]</a>: And then once the program went out for RFP, request for proposal, and came back, the mayor was about to sign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2493.54s">[Marks]</a>: And he thought better of it and said, let me have the council do a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2499.056s">[Marks]</a>: where business owners came down, the ones that did know about it came down, and they offered many suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2507.362s">[Marks]</a>: And I talked to a business owner tonight that was at that meeting, not gonna state his name, and he wasn't aware of the mayor just signing this, but I asked him, is that acceptable, two spots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2519.051s">[Marks]</a>: And he said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2521.754s">[Marks]</a>: And he thought he was gonna have some input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2524.977s">[Marks]</a>: And he had no input at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2526.598s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't know who the mayor met with, as Councilor Penta mentioned, but this was a decision made strictly by the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2536.166s">[Marks]</a>: If the mayor was so concerned about providing such an experience for parkers in this community, why did he let resident permit parking go for so many years without enforcement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2549.537s">[Marks]</a>: But he collected the fee for the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2552.74s">[Marks]</a>: He didn't let that go, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2554.619s">[Marks]</a>: He made sure he collected the fee, but he didn't provide the enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2558.522s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor allowed people to park from Winchester and Arlington and West Bedford for years and take the commuter rail in, and take the buses in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2568.128s">[Marks]</a>: He allowed them to park in Bedford Square and Haines Square for years, Mr. President, without enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2575.273s">[Marks]</a>: So, you know, I'm not sold on this program, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2579.396s">[Marks]</a>: Councilor Caviello just mentioned the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2583.497s">[Marks]</a>: retired police officers possibly doing the role in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2588.038s">[Marks]</a>: I offered back some years ago, Mr. President, to look at having crossing guards who I spoke to the union president, said they would be more than happy to do that task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2600.681s">[Marks]</a>: They already have uniforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2602.741s">[Marks]</a>: Many of them are already trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2604.742s">[Marks]</a>: And at the time, it just fell on deaf ears to take this in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2612.711s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor went off, signed it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2614.712s">[Marks]</a>: I wish him well on this, but I wish there were more public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2620.355s">[Marks]</a>: I wish that there was more input from the community and from business owners in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2626.799s">[Marks]</a>: And I wish we had some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2627.98s">[Marks]</a>: We waited this many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2630.241s">[Marks]</a>: I wish we had some time to really sit behind the table like we did a few weeks ago and really iron out some of the differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2638.766s">[Marks]</a>: And we really didn't have that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2641.525s">[Marks]</a>: And I think the mayor fell short of the mark on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2645.647s">[Marks]</a>: And it's going to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2647.909s">[Marks]</a>: At some point, when the aggressive enforcement starts, it's going to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2652.792s">[Marks]</a>: And the mayor is going to do everything he can to hide behind the issue, like he did in this letter, stating, if you read half the letter, half it's about the council votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2665.199s">[Marks]</a>: What member behind this reel voted on the proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2668.493s">[Marks]</a>: We voted to allow the mayor to enter into a 10-year contract because of state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2675.796s">[Marks]</a>: My vote wasn't predicated on what was involved within that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2681.294s">[Marks]</a>: My vote was to allow them because all three bids came back for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2685.835s">[Marks]</a>: So at the time, the mayor presented it to us saying, I can't negotiate at all because I don't have the authority to go and negotiate anything over three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2694.658s">[Marks]</a>: You have to give me the ability to negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2697.259s">[Marks]</a>: And that's what this council did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2699.56s">[Marks]</a>: We never voted on the terms of the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2703.021s">[Marks]</a>: Not one time did we ever vote on the terms of the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2709.003s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3107.079s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3108.019s">[Marks]</a>: And I appreciate Mr. White being here on behalf of the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3112.461s">[Marks]</a>: You just mentioned that you've participated in the process all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3117.242s">[Marks]</a>: Other than the meeting we had a few weeks back, Jonathan, what other participation has the chamber had in crafting this particular proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3275.59s">[Marks]</a>: So just so I understand, if he was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3277.81s">[Marks]</a>: The mayor was consulting with the past executive director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3281.772s">[Marks]</a>: Why were so many business owners caught off guard of what actually was in the proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3287.554s">[Marks]</a>: And I'm not quite sure that I buy the fact that the chamber has had so much input in this proposal because the input really didn't take place until three and a half, four weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3303.309s">[Marks]</a>: And as you mentioned, this has been a process since 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3305.89s">[Marks]</a>: This has been an ongoing process for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3308.991s">[Marks]</a>: So I guess why all of a sudden in the last three weeks was it that the chamber was invited to the table to give input when supposedly there was open dialogue and input from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3322.274s">[Marks]</a>: the chamber for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3323.935s">[Marks]</a>: I don't understand why he took such a direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3327.298s">[Marks]</a>: If there was that much input for the last five years from the chamber, I would have think some of the issues would have been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3333.843s">[Marks]</a>: And really, the issues that I hear from business owners weren't addressed, still really aren't addressed, but weren't really talked about until three weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4278.717s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4280.879s">[Marks]</a>: For those that are not aware, there are many petitions circulating the community right now for support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4289.028s">[Marks]</a>: of a dog park in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4292.331s">[Marks]</a>: We were promised back in 2011 by the mayor that he was going to implement a dog park somewhere within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4303.719s">[Marks]</a>: And I am asking now for a complete itemization of the money that the mayor supposedly accepted from J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4313.506s">[Marks]</a>: White bridge construction, which was mitigation money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4317.578s">[Marks]</a>: back in, I believe, 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4318.939s">[Marks]</a>: And also, September 2010 was the Meffitt Jingle Bell Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4327.141s">[Marks]</a>: They had a dog show and raised money for the dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4330.942s">[Marks]</a>: Also, the Doggie Fun Run at Hormel Stadium, which was in 2013 and just recently held in 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4339.774s">[Marks]</a>: 14, and also the Boston Volunteer Solutions Incorporated donated $1,766 to develop a dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4348.881s">[Marks]</a>: And I would like a complete itemized list of the different groups and organizations that have donated the money, when it was donated, and how much is in that account as it currently exists, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4406.409s">[Marks]</a>: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for those kind words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4410.55s">[Marks]</a>: And, Mr. President, you know, I recognize, and I think many people behind this reeling, because we've all supported it, the fact that there's a need in this community, the fact that we have space in this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4422.964s">[Marks]</a>: The fact that money's been raised in this community, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4426.485s">[Marks]</a>: And I think all three combine to a reason why we need this park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4430.947s">[Marks]</a>: And I, as one person, believe that we can no longer wait for this in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4438.249s">[Marks]</a>: It was promised back three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4440.25s">[Marks]</a>: It's a great way to exercise, socialize your dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4443.771s">[Marks]</a>: People meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4444.551s">[Marks]</a>: You know, Somerville last year licensed over 7,000 dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4451.621s">[Marks]</a>: in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4452.622s">[Marks]</a>: Method licensed, I believe it was about 425, 400 dogs in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4455.826s">[Marks]</a>: So I think it shows you, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4463.848s">[Marks]</a>: When you have a community that has support for a dog park, support for initiatives like that, that people come out, they'll license their dogs, they'll get active, and that's healthy in a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4477.559s">[Marks]</a>: And I think other surrounding communities that do have dog parks, Melrose, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, Brookline, Arlington, Malden, Billerica, that have dog parks experience this, and our residents, I believe, are losing out on this experience as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4493.134s">[Marks]</a>: the need to exercise their dogs, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4542.248s">[Marks]</a>: Anyone interested in passing out petitions or putting them in businesses can contact myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4549.2s">[Marks]</a>: or, you know, maybe do it collectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4552.921s">[Marks]</a>: Any counselor, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4553.981s">[Marks]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4554.181s">[Marks]</a>: I mean, you know, we're, we're trying to organize and like Council Knight said, it's grassroots and it's very difficult to get the list of, we did get a list of everyone that pulled the dog license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4566.704s">[Marks]</a>: We're in the process of trying to contact people and eventually where the hopes are, Mr. President, that we're going to present all these petitions on a dog rally here at city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4578.061s">[Marks]</a>: And hopefully we'll have enough interest and enough participation to show the mayor that this is something, and I think the mayor agrees, but he's working slowly on it, that there's a need out there, and the need is eminent, and there's no reason to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6070.132s">[Marks]</a>: Councillor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6071.833s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I thank my Councillor colleague for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6075.116s">[Marks]</a>: And I think actually Councillor Knight hit the nail on the head on the fact that the ball's in our court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6082.502s">[Marks]</a>: And if we want to have a public hearing here, if we want to have a committee of the whole meeting, if we want to have a subcommittee meeting, I personally prefer the fact that the Water and Sewer Commission has come up before the podium, as was just stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6094.444s">[Marks]</a>: and present to us the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6096.985s">[Marks]</a>: Because honestly, I think we've all advocated for a tiered system for a number of years, and I wasn't aware that potentially they would mesh, if you live in a three-family, all three together, and then they would divide by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6112.512s">[Marks]</a>: I wasn't aware it would work that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6114.093s">[Marks]</a>: But these are the things I think that we have to listen to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6117.374s">[Marks]</a>: And regarding where the tier falls, if it's 0 to 800, or 800 to 1600,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6123.792s">[Marks]</a>: At any point you decide on, there's going to be a cutoff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6126.774s">[Marks]</a>: So if it was zero to 1,000, what about the people that are 1,001?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6132.257s">[Marks]</a>: So I don't think you can really go too much on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6135.499s">[Marks]</a>: And as was mentioned, the tier system that we push for as a council, and don't forget, the council also pushed for, and it's been implemented, a second meter outside to save on your sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6148.907s">[Marks]</a>: That was another initiative by this council pushing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6152.504s">[Marks]</a>: I think the TAD system will eventually promote, as was mentioned, conservation in the community, but also make people mindful of the fact, because the water and sewage, you feel like you have no control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6166.984s">[Marks]</a>: Let's face it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6168.335s">[Marks]</a>: You go to the restroom, you've got to flush your toilet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6170.976s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to take a shower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6171.856s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to drink water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6173.357s">[Marks]</a>: You've got to wash your lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6176.338s">[Marks]</a>: There's basic things that you need to do with water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6179.799s">[Marks]</a>: And this is the first time that someone may have control over what their bill is actually going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6186.321s">[Marks]</a>: So if you wanted to conserve and fall into a different range, then you could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6192.042s">[Marks]</a>: You'd make every effort to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6194.683s">[Marks]</a>: And I think we'll end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6197.751s">[Marks]</a>: saving as Councilor Knight mentioned in the long run, people money, save money in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6203.354s">[Marks]</a>: And the fact that we have, as Councilor Penta just mentioned, $8 million, I am shocked to hear $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6208.716s">[Marks]</a>: I know it was $6.5 million or right around $6 million not too long ago, but that account is growing exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6216.06s">[Marks]</a>: You know, every member of this Council has stated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6220.343s">[Marks]</a>: That count was never intended to be this pot of gold, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6225.269s">[Marks]</a>: It's for infrastructure improvements and to offset water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6229.755s">[Marks]</a>: And God knows we need a lot of infrastructure improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6234.704s">[Marks]</a>: You know, the water and sewer that's, the water that's seeping into our old drain pipes, our old sewer pipes, that's costing us millions of dollars to treat as raw sewage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6244.746s">[Marks]</a>: As Councilor Penton mentioned, INI, the, I mean, the leak detection program, that's also costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6254.668s">[Marks]</a>: These are the things that that $8 million should be going into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6258.488s">[Marks]</a>: We have illegal catch basins right now that are directly connected to the sewer system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6263.376s">[Marks]</a>: So when it rains, that water goes out, and it's just groundwater, and it's treated as raw sewage, costing us millions of dollars a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6272.925s">[Marks]</a>: We know where these catch basins are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6274.786s">[Marks]</a>: We have $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6276.508s">[Marks]</a>: Why aren't we doing anything to improve the infrastructure, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6280.37s">[Marks]</a>: This has been a bone of contention that I've spoken about for years, Mr. President, and now we have money sitting in a fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6288.475s">[Marks]</a>: Why don't we use it for infrastructure improvements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6290.916s">[Marks]</a>: I know some attempts have been made, and we've made some progress in that direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6296.261s">[Marks]</a>: of improving inflow and infiltration and also leak detection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6300.882s">[Marks]</a>: But at the rate we're going, we're never going to get ahead of the bell curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6304.663s">[Marks]</a>: We're never going to get ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6306.524s">[Marks]</a>: And residents are going to be looking at their bills saying, someday this is going to be more than my tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6311.905s">[Marks]</a>: And the way we're going, this is not my statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6314.526s">[Marks]</a>: It's been stated 100 times before this council that someday your water and sewer bill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6320.796s">[Marks]</a>: will be more than your taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6322.497s">[Marks]</a>: And people will be looking to point the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6325.478s">[Marks]</a>: And all they can point to that is the fact that we've done very little as a community to improve our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6332.241s">[Marks]</a>: We've done very little to improve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6334.402s">[Marks]</a>: We do take advantage of 0% finance loans every so often and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6339.164s">[Marks]</a>: But we're never going to get ahead of the hundreds of miles of pipe that exist underneath our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6346.331s">[Marks]</a>: unless we start being proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6348.433s">[Marks]</a>: Every year, take up a certain hotspot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6350.995s">[Marks]</a>: We know the hotspots are where there's a lot of leakage and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6354.359s">[Marks]</a>: We know where the hotspots are that are accepting groundwater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6357.962s">[Marks]</a>: We know where the leaks are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6359.443s">[Marks]</a>: We know where all the issues stand, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6363.047s">[Marks]</a>: However, because it's underground, you know, out of sight, out of mind, the old saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6368.132s">[Marks]</a>: You know, the administration tends to put that on the back burner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6371.34s">[Marks]</a>: And they like to have that little nest egg out there so they can say, well, our bond rating is low because we have these reserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6378.786s">[Marks]</a>: I don't think we should be using the rate payers' reserves out there if we're not going to the intended purpose, which is infrastructure improvements and to lower the rates, just to say we can get a better bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6390.355s">[Marks]</a>: That's not the intent of that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6392.847s">[Marks]</a>: And the intent is definitely not to build an $8 million surplus on your hard-earned money, Mr. President, my hard-earned money, and every other taxpayer in this community that's working to make a buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6403.433s">[Marks]</a>: We should be holding $8 million in reserve, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6406.494s">[Marks]</a>: I thank my colleague, Counselor Penta, for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.23s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7096.791s">[Marks]</a>: Also, in addition to the city solicitor, can we also invite the city engineer at the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7102.672s">[Marks]</a>: And did you mention Councilor Penter as the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7108.887s">[Marks]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7109.308s">[Marks]</a>: I would ask the chair then if, uh, I think you would need at least two hours in a meeting like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7114.811s">[Marks]</a>: Uh, cause I think sometimes in an hour you're hard pressed to get the questions and answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7121.076s">[Marks]</a>: And, uh, so I would ask that, uh, if my colleague would try to plan a two hour meeting on a Wednesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7145.041s">[Marks]</a>: He's a paid consultant, so I think we're going to- Well, he came up with the rates, I'm sure, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7170.804s">[Marks]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7193.07s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7194.611s">[Marks]</a>: These were two separate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7196.127s">[Marks]</a>: trip-and-fall accidents on Carolina Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7200.43s">[Marks]</a>: One, the woman was taken to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7202.711s">[Marks]</a>: She broke her nose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7204.252s">[Marks]</a>: She did some damage to her jawbone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7206.754s">[Marks]</a>: And the other woman fell down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7208.095s">[Marks]</a>: I believe had some leg damage, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7211.197s">[Marks]</a>: But both sidewalks are above, actually, the curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7217.101s">[Marks]</a>: So when you step up onto the sidewalk, you hit the lip of the sidewalk, rather than just go onto a flat plane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7226.002s">[Marks]</a>: And they really, in the interest of public safety, need to be done immediately, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8366.602s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8368.263s">[Marks]</a>: As we all know, and Jean's been very vocal over the years, Jean has been a staunch advocate of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8375.307s">[Marks]</a>: So even though her statements went in many different directions, I think where it lies with Jean is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8381.8s">[Marks]</a>: She's always been a supporter of public safety and the men and women in the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8386.142s">[Marks]</a>: Also, Mr. President, while we have her here, and I know it's getting late, but Jean has attended a meeting in Washington and has done yeoman's work on all sorts of disability issues and VA issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8401.45s">[Marks]</a>: And I'd like to hear- Councilor Mox?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8417.067s">[Marks]</a>: I just would like, Mr. President, if Jane could fill us in on her endeavors with the VA and the disabilities and what she just recently did in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8620.405s">[Marks]</a>: Mr. President, I just would like to thank Jean on behalf of all Method residents for her work and diligence with the DAV and all the great things that she does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8631.408s">[Marks]</a>: That was very interesting to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8632.708s">[Marks]</a>: Thank you, Jean.<br><br>
