 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8407.756s">Hi,</a> can you hear me?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8410.957s">Thank</a> you, Jean Izzo, 35 Power Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8413.738s">First</a> off, you continue to refer to current zoning not being built. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8417.9s">However,</a> the own lot sizes are not in alignment with the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8422.142s">So</a> one would have to stack parcels to build by right right now, where your new zoning is significantly decreasing the lot square footage requirements, and you could in fact subdivide and multiply the density result. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8434.707s">So</a> it's incredibly disingenuous <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8437.428s">to</a> imply that the decision will not open the floodgates of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8441.592s">A</a> good number of Medford residents continue to say here tonight that they aren't feeling heard and that we need to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8447.657s">As</a> someone who has worked in the industry for decades, I find it abhorrent that we continue to move forward without the necessary studies that determine the feasibility to your concepts and proper iterative feedback loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8461.248s">It's</a> rapacious and reprehensible that we need to move at a speed that placates, quote, developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8467.113s">And</a> I use that term loosely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8469.455s">Make</a> no mistake here tonight, predatory developers are already door knocking, turning up the heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8475.521s">There's</a> money to be made, hand over fist, buy right in some areas, thanks to the effort so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8481.226s">And</a> our at-risk and marginalized neighbors <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8483.848s">many</a> of which who cannot speak up, especially in this current political climate, will be displaced, even though the studies that you guys continue to point to for justification call out that this should be mitigated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8496.111s">It</a> isn't, it won't, and no one should pretend otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8499.572s">You're</a> putting developer profits over residents' needs, considering future potential affluent residents at the expense of the current marginalized residents, and you're putting the cost of development on residents and not where it belongs with the developer flippers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8514.155s">all</a> of which will land us with a new age city on antiquated infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8518.897s">The</a> MBT 3A zoning requirements, which we complied with as of December of 2024, sets a density rate of 15 units per acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8528.38s">Your</a> proposal for our city at last calculation is five fold over the state requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8535.282s">Your</a> slide deck scenarios aren't even remotely in alignment with how a developer <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8540.044s">will</a> approach their project and financial modeling decision making, no matter the spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8545.208s">Thank</a> God, or those playing developer may have taken notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8549.331s">For</a> some neighborhoods you continue to move the goal lines, and the public continues to get information, not in advance but instead during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8557.097s">It's</a> not proper, it's not inclusive, and it's not just. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8560.74s">Mass</a> General Law 40A section 5, thank you, requires the zoning text be provided in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8568.469s">Please</a> begin to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8570.772s">We</a> need to be in alignment with the industry best practices and the secretariat and agency requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8577.52s">All</a> have been outlined in previous emails to you guys under separate cover by resident industry experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8583.225s">So</a> echoing my fellow Medforians, I would like to say, again, we need to slow down, pause, pull the information into a digestible format, and take it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8593.654s">Expertise</a> is the ability to simplify the complex, and this is what our residents are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8599.539s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5417.474s">All</a> right, let me get closer to my computer, is this better? <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5420.816s">Yes,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5422.317s">I'll</a> just hang close to my computer, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5424.378s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5425.439s">I'm</a> at Parr Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5427.3s">I</a> do have a letter prepared, but I have a few comments that I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5431.283s">I</a> think it's important as we speak as a community to just be thoughtful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5436.326s">And</a> I would like to share for people's consideration, it's great to kind of be wishful about what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5442.29s">But</a> the sad fact here in Medford is that the city of Medford, whether we like it or not, does not attract transformative developers in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5452.536s">We</a> simply attract flippers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5454.677s">And</a> our most recent example of that was the four-acre, approximate four-acre RFP in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5461.081s">We</a> had a room full of developers that were promised friendly PDUs and autonomy in what they were going to build there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5468.525s">And</a> at the end of the day, we had a response from two, and they weren't even really the true transformative developers you see respond in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5478.774s">So</a> we can talk about acres of land and what we'd like to do and what we'd like to see and what we think is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5485.94s">But</a> I'm telling you as someone who is in the industry, and I have many a conversation with a variety of people in the industry, <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5494.027s">there</a> is a very low interest in Medford for anybody but a flipper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5499.17s">And</a> so what we are developing here in this programmatical exercise in rezoning is nothing but <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5506.923s">what</a> is friendly to flippers and speculative developers who are going to harass the residents as they do their monetary build-outs for their speculative projects and force long-time residents out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5523.0s">I</a> just would like to, if you'll give me the little bit of latitude, I have a handful of other thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5527.942s">I</a> want to displace people of this idea that if you build a four or a six-story building, that it's going to get an elevator and you're going to be able to travel where you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5539.465s">ADA</a> compliance isn't driven by height, it's driven by statutory requirements, and it is a percentage of build-outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5548.347s">It</a> is a percentage of what is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5550.767s">So</a> each project will net a different type <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5554.228s">of</a> ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5555.891s">You</a> might not be able to visit your friends because there might not be an elevator or your friends might be on the ground floor in a back area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5563.022s">So</a> this idea that every new building that's coming in is going to be 100% ADA is not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5568.921s">Also</a> new construction does not, and higher units does not necessarily equate to affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5576.404s">If</a> you don't hit the 10 unit threshold, you get no affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5580.146s">We</a> saw that on Winthrop Street in West Medford, where they blasted away the land and were creative about how they subdivided it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rUHv9xQGeWo&t=5589.21s">And</a> the city got zero affordable units in an environment where the units are selling at almost $2 million each.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6784.982s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6785.343s">First,</a> let me take the opportunity to also extend my condolences on the loss of your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6790.363s">My</a> name's Jean Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6792.785s">I</a> live at 35 Parris Street in the heart of the Glenwood neighborhood being discussed tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6797.67s">The</a> recently released state housing report indicates that we need 220,000 units in this state by 2035, but it doesn't indicate that all of that needs to come from the city of Medford and specifically this Glenwood neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6809.861s">Affordable</a> housing is important, but so is the question, affordable to whom? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6814.245s">I</a> want to be clear and on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6816.347s">A</a> yes vote tonight will gentrify out the marginalized in our environmental justice neighborhood currently living in affordable homes in favor of developer profit and the affluent who want to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6826.955s">I</a> find the need to again iterate tonight that parcel along side streets should not be included in corridor nor urban zones as side streets do not qualify elsewhere in the city in proximity to actual transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6839.163s">The</a> MBTA is not improving our transit here, they're splitting our single bus route and assuming everyone is going to be able to take a bus is wishful thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6847.247s">The</a> differently abled don't get the same spoons as you do, and not all of them get a blue placard. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6852.63s">The</a> fact that we are on the precipice of this proposal to further densify and exacerbate the inequities and density in this area relative to the remainder of the city is deeply unjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6863.976s">that</a> we are going to pass the zoning without even the most baseline of industry standards and documentation such as existing conditions, infrastructure impact, and constructability within your proposed minimums, which will open the city to a variety of liabilities you're going to learn about later on, and not even the most rudimentary of an urban master plan is mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6883.345s">The</a> studies that need to be done aren't completed parcel by parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6886.728s">That</a> is death by paper cuts, and it puts the price squarely on the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6891.293s">Cambridge,</a> yes, has just passed landmark changes to zoning with four-story multifamily by right, but it's a 5,000 square foot lot, and here we're at 3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6901.082s">So</a> even Cambridge thinks it's utterly inappropriate to have anything less than 5,000 square feet anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6907.868s">Truly,</a> we must take a step back to move forward properly and assure that we're following industry best practices, looking out for the marginalized within our community, all while figuring out the way to find the balance between affordability, density, human scale development, activated places, placeholders, and an interesting place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6928.465s">I</a> appreciate the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6929.826s">I</a> know that this won't happen swiftly for some, but the idea that it won't happen swiftly in Glenwood is a farce. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6936.829s">For</a> the developers, it's all about the financial modeling and return on investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6941.032s">As</a> I look out my window tonight, I see a new backhoe across the street in the side yard on the corner of Tainter. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6947.735s">The</a> lot is clear and ready for their permits in the coming days. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6951.197s">So</a> yes, it in fact is coming to Glenwood and it is burgeoning and just waiting for those new permit applications <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6957.4s">to</a> be able to be filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=6958.84s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a href="../2025-03-06_mPeOR452BSI/2025-03-06_mPeOR452BSI.html">Salem Street CBD -- Continued Public Hearing</a></h2>

King. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=3614.312s">And</a> it essentially says that when a university is one of the largest landowners and is behaving like a developer, Dover <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=3623.974s">does</a> not protect, but they need to be treated like a landowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=3629.98s">And</a> I would urge Tufts, as it has these opportunities that will come forward, to be a good neighbor to the people who reside here well beyond four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=3640.55s">I</a> thank you for the time.

<a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2261.365s">And</a> the new park department is blaming Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2265.386s">After</a> a year and a half, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2268.067s">I</a> have my visitor pass that says Stearns Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2271.708s">I</a> applied for two senior passes with my license and registration that says Stearns Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2279.51s">So</a> they do have my information. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2282.151s">What</a> is going to be done about this office? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2284.831s">Enough</a> is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2286.872s">They</a> have had plenty of time to be up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2290.214s">The</a> city keeps pouring money into this department and it is not working correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2297.158s">We</a> are taxpayers in the city of Medford and don't deserve to be treated like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2303.282s">I</a> see a lot of out-of-state plates parked all over the city, especially in South Medford, but no tickets for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2312.167s">And</a> on the day in question, there were two on our street, no tickets for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2316.871s">I</a> feel like we have been targeted in South Medford, and I have never felt like that in the 65 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2326.219s">The</a> day our street was ticketed, four other abutting streets were also targeted with the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2333.125s">Please</a> explain to me and the citizens of Medford what can be done about this office. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2339.368s">They</a> also have a camera recording citizens, but do they have one recording inside the office, when they are rude to the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2349.22s">And</a> I would like to ask our fine citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2353.718s">If</a> they have had a problem with this office to please email the mayor and let her know. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2360.121s">Just</a> one more item before I end. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2362.883s">The</a> PAC department now has everyone's permit passes ending on December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2370.927s">How</a> are they going to handle all of this at once when they couldn't handle it being staggered? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2377.63s">That's</a> a big question and thank you for listening to me.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2424.871s">They</a> blamed Medford.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2428.757s">They</a> did, they did.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2446.612s">So</a> they're just going to pay the ticket, and is that how the city's getting money?

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5953.466s">what</a> Member Kreatz has told us about the potential that we're seeing throughout the state to reconsider naming for Native American tribes and individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5963.232s">I</a> look at Belinda Sutton and I look at Jean Barry Sutherland, and I wish I had known both of them because they seem to be amazing women and amazing individuals in their own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5974.319s">But</a> I often talk about things in context when we talk about history. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5978.081s">I've</a> spoken in the past about buildings in context and spaces in context. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5983.001s">And</a> I think there is a compelling context to have the school that is currently the Columbus School named for Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5992.727s">I</a> would implore you to consider that it's not a zero sum game. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5995.769s">There</a> are other opportunities in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5998.43s">And</a> had we had more time, maybe we could have even talked about a Medford week where we learn about all of these Medford individuals.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9636.867s">One</a> minute.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9638.388s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9651.584s">Hi,</a> my name is Samantha Sinek and I just wanted to come and speak on behalf of Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9659.406s">I</a> think that the naming of the schools is not just about the person and the name, it's about the story that it tells us. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9666.807s">And</a> the one thing we know about Belinda Sutton is that when she tried something, she was turned away. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9675.209s">Like</a> we know of her because she wrote five petitions to get what she was owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9680.911s">And</a> every time she was turned away, but she didn't stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9684.072s">She</a> didn't give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9685.592s">She</a> stood up and she tried again and she kept fighting for what was hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9691.414s">Now,</a> Belinda Sutton's story doesn't end happily. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9694.255s">I</a> mean, she never got what she was owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9699.396s">But</a> I think that we can put her name on a building and then we can take that message to ourselves when we can learn <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9707.895s">that</a> there are a lot of people who don't get what they're owed, and we can work to be better about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9713.518s">And</a> two, we can remember that there are a lot of people who need to remember that when the world works against them, when the universe is set against them, when the world gets them down, they can still stand up and try again. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9726.884s">Because</a> in the end, we can all make our mark on the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9731.007s">and</a> Belinda Sutton made her mark by not quitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9734.009s">So</a> I just wanted to speak for her name because her story is really powerful and I think I would like to see it on a building.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw/2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw.html">City Council 06-01-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5929.837s">We</a> as in we the people, the residents of Medford asked for that to be done, because there was some discussion about whether use variance was allowed, because there is a conflict that was in the codified document that was on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5948.591s">That</a> is what occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5950.772s">It</a> was brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5952.433s">And</a> that was the initial just you can shake your head no, but
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5962.881s">Yes,</a> recently that was the ruling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5965.024s">But</a> the reason it went to court is because there was some discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5969.647s">And</a> an opinion is just that, an opinion.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6015.066s">So</a> I have to go through the law department for you to get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6018.249s">It's</a> incorrect, but I'll do it.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3231.454s">Can</a> I speak on any topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3234.115s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3234.736s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3235.316s">I'd</a> like to speak if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3237.437s">My</a> name is Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3238.358s">I</a> live at 35 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3241.519s">I</a> was watching from home and I came in because you were talking about 40 B developments and the housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3249.724s">And</a> I wanted to come for you tonight to just put a fine point on a few things that you all were speaking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3256.555s">The</a> first, that the 40B projects are on hold and causing tax revenue losses is inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3266.079s">We</a> are in court because there is a disagreement on the calculation for GLAM and whether or not we qualify for safe harbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3277.904s">And</a> we are in court because currently the Baker administration appointees are declining all safe harbor applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3286.927s">That's</a> the first point I want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3288.868s">The</a> second point I want to make is that the 40 bees that I mentioned in the housing production plan are referenced as being 100% counted as government algorithm affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3304.933s">They</a> are not 100% affordable, by no means are not truly affordable by what the majority of Medford residents can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3315.536s">the</a> units that are putting there that are affordable will either be 20 or 25%. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3321.678s">So</a> please, let's not walk away from today's conversation with the impression that we're declining 40 Bs that are 100% affordable opportunities for the residents of Medford and the greater area that we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3337.443s">I</a> just wanna put a fine point on that because there seems to be <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3343.073s">that</a> people speak about 4DBs with a level of expertise that isn't really present. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3350.195s">And</a> it's important that we understand the complexities of 4DB and how they impact development and how they impact potential affordability because this is an extremely nuanced topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3364.578s">It's</a> a political hot topic and it's a lot of discussion is underway about the right approaches <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3372.357s">to</a> reach truly affordable solutions that target what the average person can, under a normal salary range, be able to afford to occupy, buy, rent, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3388.081s">So</a> please, I'd just like to make sure that we're not walking away having our residents think that if these 40 Bs are built, they'll be 100% affordable and there'll be housing that everybody can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3398.384s">Thank</a> you for your time.

href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7155.83s">I'm</a> a proud lifelong Redford resident, a first generation Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7161.492s">My</a> dad came to this country with lint in his pocket and a recipe for rock soup. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7166.634s">And</a> he and my mom carved out a wonderful life for our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7170.415s">And</a> I'm grateful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7172.016s">I'm</a> also Native American. <a

<a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7179.979s">I'm</a> really saddened by what is going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7183.66s">and</a> specifically with this issue, because although it may have begun as a political issue, we did have a moment when the committee was pulled together and brought together under their committee of the whole in their school committee meeting, where they could have risen above the politics of it and used it as an opportunity to join our community together, to look for opportunities to help the community learn about people like June Barry Sullivan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7212.73s">who</a> I knew not very much about because I didn't have the privilege of attending any of her classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7218.314s">And</a> many of the other 18 plus people that were put forth as potential nominees for the position or the honor of having the building named. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7229.542s">We</a> could have had a situation where that committee crafted a schedule by which they could have provided us information about the candidates for naming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7241.233s">additional</a> information about the 18 people who were selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7245.015s">We</a> could have had a lovely event and a lovely time period where we discussed it as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7251.958s">We</a> voted on it, and we found a way to celebrate when we renamed the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7256.7s">But</a> we didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7258.301s">It</a> remained political, and it remained political because a handful of people are using their political will, regardless of what they're being told by their constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7269.632s">And</a> while I agree through the chair with Councilor Knight, that we have grave concerns about our budget, the essence of what makes our government, our government is that it is by, of, and for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7285.182s">Not</a> five people on street, not seven people on city council, not one person in the mayor's office, but every last one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7295.468s">And</a> unless and until we can find a way <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7298.95s">to</a> come together to the middle and talk about what is best, what is right, what is fair, what is just, what is equitable, and what is equity in an honest and sincere way. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7313.339s">Through</a> empathy and compassion and trying to understand one another, we are never, never going to move past where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7322.685s">I'm</a> going to be where I've always been, in the middle, trying to be the person that sees it from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7328.853s">I</a> would hope that you all do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7330.675s">And</a> I would hope that, although you may not be able to do something about it from behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7335.715s">you</a> will talk to your fellow members of our municipality and have some conversations with them about a way to move forward in a manner that helps us to heal, because we still can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7348.558s">There</a> is nothing about the date that was selected, other than the school committee decided that's when it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7355.899s">There</a> is no reason why as a community, we cannot decide to pump the brakes on this and really find a mechanism to move forward <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7365.148s">where</a> we rise up above it and use it as an opportunity to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7369.61s">Because</a> what I can tell you about Italian-Americans growing up in Italian-American homes is that we would never want to do something that hurts another person. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7380.727s">We</a> would never want to step on another's right because we, in the past, have been considered non-white and treated badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7389.75s">It's</a> not the first time people have called Italian-Americans crooks and criminals, and it won't be the last time unless we all rise up together and demand better of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7400.274s">I</a> thank you for your time.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2900.011s">Can</a> you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2901.652s">Yes,</a> Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2902.553s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2903.253s">I</a> appreciate the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2905.294s">A</a> few thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2906.055s">First,</a> I wanna just recall for the school committee that in June of 2020, we had an initial response of 180 names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2917.16s">I</a> think you have those on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2919.082s">I</a> have the receipt of email that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2922.123s">So</a> those names still connect with those 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2924.404s">I'd</a> like to say that I think that it's important that folks consider <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2932.438s">that</a> affect an impact of a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2935.941s">Yes,</a> we voted to do it, but we aren't really doing very good change management here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2940.864s">This</a> is really being shoved through. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2942.646s">It</a> is painful on both sides of the situation, both for people of color who have been impacted and for the Italian American community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2953.494s">And</a> it does a disservice when people dismiss either side's positions, thoughts, and feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2961.363s">And</a> I find that really troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2963.384s">And</a> I think that's what folks are saying when they're saying it's too fast, we need to slow down and we need to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2970.186s">You</a> know, it goes beyond this being an election cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2973.467s">People</a> will remember, people are going to be impacted and simply changing the name isn't going to make it go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2980.949s">Change</a> is a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2982.289s">Historically,</a> we haven't done a good job of it here in Medford, regardless of what the topic is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2987.931s">And</a> this smacks of being another situation <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2990.902s">where</a> things are just being pushed through for expediency because that's what a handful of people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2997.367s">Really,</a> I think you need to be careful about how a committee is selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3001.229s">And</a> I think we need to be careful about how people are treated overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3005.472s">After</a> all, the whole point of the argument of the name change is because this individual allegedly has treated people- And you have 15 seconds, 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3014.739s">And</a> so I wanna just implore people to consider not only their own perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3020.862s">but</a> others as well, and let's try to move forward in a way that's positive to folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3025.626s">But</a> I really think we do have more important things to be dealing with at the moment in the middle of a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3031.41s">Thank</a> you for your time.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4241.365s">Hello,</a> how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4242.986s">Thank</a> you for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4244.608s">I</a> just wanted to ask one thing, and this is the major thing that is going around Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4249.992s">Does</a> anyone care about the division that this is causing Medford right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4256.678s">That's</a> what I really want you council members to actually think about is what this is doing to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4262.483s">This</a> isn't just actually a Medford thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4264.504s">This</a> goes way above Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4266.326s">This</a> is now a state thing where other people are speaking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4270.393s">Have</a> you thought about that at all?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4277.257s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4278.098s">So</a> I'm not, none of you really know me, but I come from, I'm an Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4282.881s">My</a> parents and my great grandparents are all, you know, I'm the first to come over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4288.484s">And</a> the thing that Columbus is so important to us, it's not the person, as David said, it's what it is to Italian Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4297.009s">South</a> Medford is a very Italian-American community, just like a lot of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4302.031s">You</a> are basically taking that away and stomping on all our traditions, everything that we care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4307.914s">A</a> lot of people that are against this, as you say, they're not really from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4312.896s">They</a> might now live in Medford, but they don't know the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4316.157s">No</a> one on the committee is actually Italian-American. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4319.518s">So</a> you don't know how we actually feel about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4322.96s">I</a> have a son. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4324.22s">He's</a> in the second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4326.161s">He</a> came home to me, he doesn't know anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4328.543s">And</a> he said that Italians are bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4331.266s">And</a> I said, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4333.508s">Columbus</a> is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4334.649s">He's</a> a bad person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4336.29s">Nobody,</a> you don't know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4338.272s">So</a> this is my, my nine year old child is coming home saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4342.435s">And</a> he said that someone told him this in recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4345.338s">So</a> you have to think about not only what you're doing to the Italian community, but what you're doing to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4350.222s">Nicole,</a> you have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4353.607s">So</a> that's what I just want you to think about is that what this means to time community and what we feel about is not about the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4362.072s">I</a> don't think Columbus is bad, but it's about what the meeting is, why Columbus was even brought up as David has discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4369.796s">It</a> has nothing to do about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4371.597s">It's</a> made you Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4374.599s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4375.139s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4533.826s">Can</a> you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4535.027s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4535.867s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4537.148s">I'll</a> be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4538.148s">So</a> I think these conversations and the things that people are talking about illustrate very well what I alluded to earlier, and the fact that the change management process is not a process that needs to be jammed through for expediency. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4551.442s">for</a> political optics in an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4554.784s">And</a> I think that's why looking at these conversations, that's why this needs to be a more longer term conversation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4562.75s">I</a> think people are still overlooking that for a lot of Italian Americans, it's not about Columbus and what he did in his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4572.496s">It</a> is about what he became to Italian Americans who used that opportunity under Harris to lift themselves up <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4581.829s">and</a> stop being lynched and beaten and prosecuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4585.23s">Although</a> I will say as someone of Italian descent, Italians are still treated badly in certain circles and people still lock down on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4594.473s">And</a> there is stereotypical issues that occur specifically in Hollywood and the way Italians are projected and portrayed on television. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4604.715s">So</a> this idea that Italian Americans don't suffer anything isn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4610.643s">but</a> it's not in the same regard as what's going on in other areas of our culture right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4615.864s">And</a> so there's a great opportunity here as we move forward to create healing, but that's done over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4623.206s">It's</a> not done by a three week effort to put together a random committee and decide on a name out of people submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4631.889s">It's</a> more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4633.029s">And</a> I agree with the previous speaker, but there are many Italian icons that could be selected instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4639.96s">But</a> again, that's something that Italian Americans should be picking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4644.303s">We</a> shouldn't be told again, like we were told originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4647.186s">And</a> you have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4648.947s">So</a> again, I would urge you with someone who is a certified project management, change management consultant, and have been doing this type of work for 25 years, that it needs to be measured or it's going to create a deeper rift. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4663.418s">It</a> won't be something that will be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4666.861s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17071.629s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17072.79s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17074.312s">Hello,</a> I'm sorry if I have an echo. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17076.033s">So</a> I just want to touch base with what the council member just said about everyone was informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17082.357s">You</a> keep on saying that everyone was informed, but that you know that is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17086.56s">Just</a> like Brianna just said, you had two days to make this a point to change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17091.403s">The</a> community was not involved, and you all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17094.645s">So</a> to say that they were is just an insult to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17098.61s">As</a> for Paul, the way he acts and just his smirking on here is a complete insult. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17105.816s">Everyone</a> knows what Paul said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17107.117s">If</a> you go on my private, my page, you'll see a video. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17111.641s">Point</a> of privilege, member Van der Kloot.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17129.402s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17130.783s">I</a> won't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17132.043s">It's</a> already out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17132.963s">Everyone</a> knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17133.844s">I</a> just don't think it's fair for someone to say, well, I want to select X, Y, Z, when they already put out what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17141.846s">And</a> what they want is very biased. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17144.307s">So</a> I'm not unsure why these people are even allowed to have a say in anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17148.808s">And</a> Brianna, I know you know this is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17151.869s">I</a> mean, just looking at his smirk is an insult to you, nevermind all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17156.75s">That's</a> all I want to say it's already out there, and this has not been brought up I have people who have been coming to me saying like oh my god I didn't even know that this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17165.02s">It's</a> not now until us the community has brought this forward to the rest of the community that this is going on and now people are outrage. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17173.07s">I'm</a> supposed to be speaking with the Boston Globe tomorrow about this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17176.873s">And</a> I said, I'm going to wait till after this is over because I'm so heated about this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17181.076s">And</a> I want, I don't want to say something non-biased, but I'm just so saddened by what is happening and why we are still concentrating on this when our kids, we just got literally told that our kids need to be back in school by April 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17195.628s">My</a> son is afraid to go to school because he can't wash his hand because there's no paper towels. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17200.327s">Nicole,</a> we have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17203.91s">This</a> is the stuff that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17206.532s">Right</a> now, I really believe that this should be tabled, if anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17209.754s">You</a> obviously know I don't think we should change the name at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17212.436s">But</a> right now, I think this should be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17214.897s">We</a> have too many council members in the mix right here.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12436.197s">Just</a> a few quick thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12437.518s">First</a> of all, you're in a space with 20-foot ceilings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12441.421s">You're</a> distance beyond 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12443.763s">and</a> a room that typically holds between 200 and 250 people, you're currently at between two and two and a half percent capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12451.886s">As</a> for public participation, City Hall is quite large. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12456.047s">You</a> could do an inbound pathway and an outbound pathway with some staged areas, six foot distancing dots and monitors in the hallway, and citizens and residents of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12468.792s">and</a> speak in front of that chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12470.473s">And</a> if you need some help, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12472.274s">I've</a> done a million square feet of this at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12475.477s">So</a> again, I applaud you being on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12479.52s">I</a> recognize that people are concerned about masks, but right now in this moment, you're roughly at 2% occupancy, which is lower than what's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12488.627s">Thank</a> you for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12489.928s">And</a> again, if you need my help, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12492.149s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ/2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ.html">City Council 08-25-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3505.312s">Can</a> you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3506.333s">Yes,</a> we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3507.414s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3508.095s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3508.695s">I</a> apologize for not having video. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3510.417s">My</a> signal doesn't do so well with video. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3513.059s">Thanks</a> for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3516.726s">I</a> think there's some confusion on what ADU units are and what they're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3524.329s">Accessory</a> dwelling units are historically spaces that are created to allow for additional living, typically of related members. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3539.636s">So</a> in other words, an in-law apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3542.767s">above</a> a garage for your college student to have a place to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3546.829s">They're</a> not meant to be rental or condo stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3554.552s">And</a> that's important because we talk about housing and affordability and affordable housing interchangeably, but it's really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3567.458s">The</a> supply and demand curve does not inflect in housing <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3572.762s">because</a> housing isn't a consumable like a widget or a bag of sugar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3579.504s">And</a> we really need to stop conflating housing affordability with affordable housing government quota that is required by 40B for the state of Massachusetts and what housing stock does in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3599.668s">So</a> while <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3602.431s">These</a> AHUs have a place in our community to help maintain places for people to be without being displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3612.899s">They</a> will in no way, shape or form do anything to increase affordable housing, quote, units that are required as subsidized housing units are, because they're never built with those subsidy funds because they're usually <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3631.7s">put</a> into existing structures, whether it be a basement, an attic, a front room, above a garage, you're not building them separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3641.044s">That's</a> the first point I'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3643.185s">And</a> then the second point is this is just another layer of death by paper cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3650.627s">We</a> are currently seeing an influx of housing that's high value housing when we take a parcel and it's cut <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3660.079s">and</a> subdivided, and we get two or four luxury units that are high-end units that do nothing to offset and increase our threshold of income so that our affordable housing threshold rises with it, which further puts housing affordability out of reach for many Medford residents because <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3685.972s">at</a> least 40% of Medford residents do not meet that $75,000 a year threshold that we typically see with affordable housing requirements and in affordable housing lotteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3702.844s">So</a> therefore, while I think this is a commendable thing to be looking at, I would caution that we need to be very precise about what we're doing and how we're doing it in the language <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3715.983s">and</a> that we're sticking to accessory dwelling units for the purpose that's intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3721.906s">Because</a> otherwise what we're doing is we're creating yet another loophole for quote developers and flippers to come in and up zone through this new ordinance that we're looking to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3738.334s">So</a> I would caution people and I would encourage our population to think about housing affordability <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3746.18s">slightly</a> separate from affordable housing, which is the government mandated portions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3751.723s">So</a> I thank you for your time.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I/2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I.html">City Council 06-23-20</a></h2>

href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15313.871s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15314.352s">It's</a> Jean Nuzzo, Parrish Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15318.494s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15319.054s">I</a> apologize for not having video. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15321.616s">As</a> you can see, there's some technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15324.097s">So</a> I'm hoping not having video will help. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15327.559s">This</a> is my fifth cycle of budget, and I'm very excited to see that there's a lot of interest in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15336.267s">I</a> just, I'm going to try to adhere to the rabbits rules, and just have a few points to make about coven. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15343.113s">meeting</a> logistics, and I hope you'll give me a little bit of latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15348.255s">So,</a> I agree that preventing the spread of COVID is crucial in these unprecedented times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15355.318s">However,</a> it was just announced yesterday across the wire <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15360.94s">that</a> Massachusetts transmission rate is 0.67. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15364.181s">This</a> is 0.33 below the 1.0 rate that is considered significant spread of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15374.124s">So</a> what does that tell us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15375.465s">That</a> tells us that we're doing a really good job of social distancing, wearing our masks, and doing the things that we can to prevent spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15386.928s">We've</a> just entered in Massachusetts into the phase two, two on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15393.592s">And</a> what that means is that we can have an internal occupancy of 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15398.535s">In</a> the city of Medford, we have three large scale spaces that are available for these types of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15407.261s">One</a> is the Alden Chambers, which the city council meets in on Tuesday prior to the COVID crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15415.005s">One</a> is the Karen Theater at the high school, and one is the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15421.287s">At</a> 50% occupancy, I've seen the Alden Chamber full to approximately 200 to 250 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15428.909s">So</a> at 50% occupancy, we would be able to house roughly 100 people and maintain the social distancing requirements that are required, bless you, for the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15445.135s">for</a> the COVID guidelines for the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15448.356s">Additionally,</a> in conjunction with the double masking and six foot distance, when you can't keep a six foot distance, it's common practice currently in the industry to install additional clear barriers <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15463.183s">six</a> feet high and approximately four feet wide that further address the distancing requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15469.925s">So</a> there are things that are being done in the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15472.886s">We've</a> retrofitted hundreds of thousands of square feet of office and lab space to allow for people to be able to work effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15482.79s">And</a> I hope that you'll consider these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15485.251s">I</a> just want to also touch upon two more things with respect to COVID, because I think it's important that we keep hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15492.473s">The</a> first is just yesterday it was announced that pharmaceutical companies believe that they are closing in on the potential vaccine and a few, who I won't mention here, have said that they even think they might have something by early to mid-fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15510.372s">And</a> then the second noteworthy item is that ramivudine, which is being tested as an injectable, has done so well that the manufacturing and pharmaceutical company has announced, I believe it was this morning, that they are investigating an inhalation dose, which means that people will be able to dose themselves under doctor's orders as they would a regular prescription like any other inhaler. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15538.077s">So</a> these are wonderful things that we can think of the fact that we're at 0.67 percent, people are doing what needs to be done, and there is a way that we can meet together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15548.873s">I</a> think it's important because people process information differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15555.88s">People</a> are differently abled, and we need to use every mechanism to provide opportunities for people to be able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15564.388s">I</a> know that we did the housing production webinar earlier in the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15568.612s">We</a> were able to turn on, through Zoom, a real-time closed caption, which some folks that were in attendance found really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15578.542s">Perhaps</a> we could reach out and share that information so that closed caption would become available to folks attending city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15587.73s">Saying</a> attendance is increased just because of Zoom is really not an apples to apples comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15594.752s">It's</a> great that we have more people attending, but if it's different people and we've excluded people who were previously there, we've done a disservice to those folks while providing an additional service to others. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15607.035s">And</a> then even beyond that we have people in our community Who are still on the outskirts for whatever reason and not feeling welcomed into the meanings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15615.883s">So</a> I hope that we'll take these opportunities To consider how we can invite all members of our community into these dialogues in person in video and on the phone as well as watching our <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15631.416s">pegged</a> channel that has been a lifeline for many people for many years and part of their social interactions on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15639.725s">So</a> I do hope we leverage these opportunities to make these things available. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15646.111s">I</a> would also suggest that it may be worthwhile to investigate having some Zoom <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15654.461s">have</a> some information on Robert's rules of order to help some of the folks who are beginning to attend city Council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15663.794s">I</a> can remember when I first started to attend Council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15667.239s">It</a> was very daunting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15668.481s">It</a> was a little scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15670.323s">And</a> it took me some time to get used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15672.423s">And</a> even still now, I don't always get it quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15675.424s">But</a> perhaps where we've got so much interest, making some of these rules and regulations available to people so that they can understand point of information and privilege and all of those things that are called in meanings will help them to understand that this is really just the protocol and processes that are used to counter means. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15693.808s">The</a> last thing I wondered, and you may not have the answer for me, and it may not be within the realm of questioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15701.136s">I've</a> been thinking about the commentary that folks made earlier about three days out of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15706.942s">If</a> folks were out of work for three days, they would have lost their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15710.005s">And</a> that's true for a lot of people, unless you're providing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15713.909s">So</a> what I was wondering, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15715.831s">I</a> would hate to have an opinion that you guys just randomly decided not to show. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15728.08s">I</a> know we do not always agree but I know you always try to do the very best and I hope that question is not out of line.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15785.193s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15786.013s">I</a> just wanted to be sure they weren't no call, no show, because I think that's a narrative that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15790.455s">And</a> I don't necessarily think that's fair, because as I said, I don't always agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15794.997s">But</a> I know that the councillors tend to try to do their very best to represent folks.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc/2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc.html">City Council 04-21-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6375.152s">So</a> that, I think that maybe it's a matter of nuance in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6380.116s">So</a> we're particularly and specifically talking about rental assistance funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6385.54s">Since</a> we took over for TRICAP, we've been serving Medford residents and providing the same housing counseling package of programming that Tabitha described earlier that involves budgeting, stabilization, case management, access to other services, and really maximizing the benefits that are available to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6404.355s">particularly</a> rental assistance is one of the least funded categories of benefit that folks are really in need of. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6413.646s">And</a> so when we're talking about calls for specifically rental assistance, folks who are in need know often <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6423.818s">Go</a> to ABCD for this service go to housing families for that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6431.484s">And</a> when there aren't rental funds available, period because it's not within the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6439.19s">Folks</a> know that they're not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6441.152s">So</a> if this were to be granted very quickly The word would spread that there are rental assistance funds available I know that with our work in Boston that most of the calls that we get have a need for rental assistance rather whether it's large or small and <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6463.033s">And</a> so it is a little chicken or the egg, unfortunately, in the conversation right now, but it's not that ABCD and our services are not known to Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6474.581s">It's</a> that this particular aspect is not known because it hasn't existed before.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_mbymTt2FVd8/2024-11-19_mbymTt2FVd8.html">City Council 02-18-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4493.721s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4494.161s">Jean</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4498.322s">Definitely,</a> if you've ever spent any time in West Medford on High Street in that area, while there's not a significant high number <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4507.626s">of</a> bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4509.067s">There</a> are many, and they travel that road faithfully, and it is a dangerous area for them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4517.376s">One</a> of the things that we do in the industry that you may want to consider is a mock-up... The cycling industry? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4524.562s">No,</a> in the construction industry.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4529.666s">Although,</a> you know, in my younger days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4532.168s">One</a> of the things we do do is we mock up and we mark out space, especially in these incremental changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4538.874s">There</a> are organizations like Team Better Block, I think they're called, that will come in and chalk mark the area in advance so that the residents and the community can see what the impact is that you're going to affect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4553.986s">for</a> a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4555.267s">It's</a> not a lot of money, it's not a lasting change, but it allows people to see that change and then start to provide meaningful feedback because most people cannot look at a drawing <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4568.038s">and</a> truly conceptualize what the impact of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4571.28s">And</a> I think we saw that down in South Medford across from the Tufts Pool, where we invested significant money to make a change to the flow of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4581.969s">And</a> it's been disastrous for the neighborhood because it put all the traffic down the side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4586.912s">And</a> while the Brooks School has a hawk signal that flashes, the Columbus School does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4594.738s">and</a> they get a significant amount of traffic and cars flow very fastly there as do the Roberts and the McGlynn so I think holistically we have a problem with people traveling excessively fast through our city and to give attention to one school <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4611.967s">and</a> not mention all the others is really not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4615.512s">That's</a> my first thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4617.395s">And</a> I would encourage you to look at that opportunity, to mark up those streets and avoid the consequence that we are seeing over on Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4627.249s">The</a> other point that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4629.311s">gives</a> me grave concern is that we are talking about eminent domain taking of private land for public safety and usage for bike paths and sidewalks and safe schools, which are all safe walking to school, which are all important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4646.865s">But</a> at the end of the day, it's an eminent domain taking of public land. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4651.366s">And</a> that is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4653.847s">So</a> I would ask you, today it's this area, three months from now it may be another. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4659.228s">Our</a> highest level for public safety is the site formerly known as the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4665.309s">Are</a> you ready to take that by eminent domain? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4668.21s">It</a> is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4670.07s">So</a> what I would urge you to do is look at maybe marking up the space and seeing what the implications are before you open that Pandora's box. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4677.873s">And</a> I thank you for your time.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg/2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg.html">City Council 01-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3250.898s">Jean</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3254.997s">I'm</a> going to give you guys an analogy, and I think this is a great idea, but it's the equivalent of putting a bucket under a flood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3262.6s">When</a> you have a deluge of water, you want to turn off the source or turn down the source to help alleviate what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3271.638s">We</a> continue to look at, and it's admirable for the short term, but it doesn't resolve the issue for the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3278.003s">And</a> what it does is turn our government into a bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3282.687s">So</a> we're saying to people, if you owe money and you can't pay it, we'll alleviate that debt temporarily by way of deferment and charge you 5% interest or 8% interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3293.576s">And</a> so now we're a bank as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3296.698s">If</a> we look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3299.153s">we</a> are planning our city and assure that we are doing things to increase our commercial tax base, what we are doing is creating new revenues of income stream so that we don't have to continue to increase real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3314.666s">And</a> I strongly object to the idea that we should tax land so that it's more valuable, because increasing the value of real estate is everything that is wrong with the housing market and is the core problem of why housing is so unaffordable, because it's become an investment opportunity and ceased to be a place where people live. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3337.148s">If</a> you look back in years past, when real estate was divided between commercial, which was investment opportunity, and residential, which was a place where you lived, housing was not inflated the way it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3353.044s">So</a> I would caution you that when we talk about these academic things, you should look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3359.23s">things</a> have come to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3361.411s">And</a> inflating the cost of land does nothing to help keep elderly people in their home or marginalized people in their home or allow for opportunities to people to be able to afford a piece of property or an apartment or a condo if they so choose to purchase into that American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3381.761s">So</a> with that said, I would <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3384.162s">You</a> know, laud the fact that we're looking at these things, but we really should be thinking about the source too, and it starts with really good and solid urban planning that takes into consideration those multiple avenues that afford us the opportunity to balance for our residents their real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3401.433s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2761.376s">Hi,</a> good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2762.016s">Gene</a> Nuzzo, 35 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2764.557s">I</a> hope you'll give me a little leeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2765.997s">I'm</a> just catching up on the happenings and I have some thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2769.245s">And</a> a few of the points that I wanted to make have been brought up in this particular topic, so hopefully you'll give me just a little bit of latitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2776.727s">I</a> want to talk about leadership, because I think it's crucial in dealing with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2782.749s">And</a> leadership involves establishing a clear vision and sharing that vision with others so they'll follow willingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2789.231s">It's</a> providing the information, knowledge, and methods to realize the vision, and it's coordinating, balancing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2795.86s">conflicting</a> interests of all the members and stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2799.322s">A</a> leader steps up in times of crisis and is able to think and act in a creative way during difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2806.646s">And</a> transparency is also crucial in this particular instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2811.849s">And</a> transparency is a lack of hidden agendas and conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2815.631s">It's</a> accompanied by the availability of full information required for collaboration, cooperation, and collective decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2825.006s">A</a> minimum degree of disclosure is required when making agreements and dealings and practices for transactions to assure everything is open and available. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2835.913s">And</a> they are essential conditions for a free and open exchange for the rules and reasons behind measures to be sure that they're fair, clear, and concise to all participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2848.84s">And</a> they're not mutually exclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2852.253s">And</a> I feel like the events that we have been going through in the city of Medford in these past several days and what I've seen on highlight reels.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2868.0s">But</a> I think it all ties together, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2870.121s">We've</a> got a lot of people who have high emotions and everybody's cherry picking different positions and items and thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2879.218s">And</a> while I don't have children in the school system, I think that brings a very different perspective to what's going on, and I'm sharing that with you because I think it comes into play, because this is one component, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2894.227s">I</a> think there's a larger issue at play here, and that is that someone, regardless of who it is, and to Brianna's point, we may never know because <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2904.65s">the</a> item has been disposed of.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2908.453s">I'm</a> trying.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2926.064s">But</a> his point was that it was found in the school because there was a rental component.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2938.344s">Do</a> you want me to do it at the end, or can I?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2943.386s">So</a> while I recognize the issue, my greatest concern is not in the response and how the decision was made, but that the item was able to be brought into the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2954.99s">And</a> I think a component of it is the rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2959.292s">But</a> the fact is that someone, we don't know who, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2962.103s">brought</a> that weapon in in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2964.405s">And</a> I think we're doing everything very piecemeal, and this is a small component. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2969.468s">So</a> I would just like to point out that it's a protocol review. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2974.892s">It's</a> a full-scale protocol review. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2977.462s">You</a> know, the reality is that the cities around the United States, not us, have been hyper-focused on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2984.808s">They've</a> developed committees on safety, both for schools and otherwise, to solicit community feedback and ideas to be included in the formation of their plans and crafting of their first response protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2999.099s">They</a> work with architects and engineers and owner's reps to review and improve existing designs to harden their building shells. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3007.801s">and</a> come up with distractive techniques within the building in the event of a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3014.006s">And</a> they find the funding and they begin the implementation of those plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3018.269s">We</a> haven't done any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3019.87s">We're</a> not even speaking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3021.992s">And</a> that is really the crux of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3024.674s">The</a> crux of the matter, from a solution perspective, isn't to cherry pick each and individual piece, but it's to look at it holistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3034.0s">And</a> not only to <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3036.758s">deal</a> with it from a logistical perspective, but to provide information to the people who are the most likely target, which is our students and our staff and our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3049.165s">We</a> need to provide them with information on how to respond, when to respond, and practice those responses so their muscle memories kick in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3058.378s">And</a> talking about rental and talking about who can use it and talking about storage and all the other pieces are just small pieces to the larger puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3068.47s">The</a> frightening fact is that we're not keeping up with the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3072.454s">In</a> Medford, we've fallen behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3074.657s">We've</a> spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3079.492s">And</a> we've let this crucial issue fall to the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3084.215s">When</a> you think about the different projects we've spent and monies to expedite some of them, some of the measures that you can do for a single school cost under $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3094.101s">And</a> while that seems like a large amount of money, we spent $500,000 to expedite the Riverside Plaza project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3103.547s">So</a> it's all about looking at the large picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3106.349s">And</a> that's my point, and that's why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3109.204s">I</a> just want to say that I believe our focus has been on the wrong place, and we as a community need to be direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3117.568s">Had</a> even some of our energy and effort been spent on concrete assessments <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3122.475s">and</a> plans to protect our schools and our public buildings, there would have been a protocol in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3129.379s">The</a> issue wouldn't have been left to the discretion of the administrative team on staff that week because they would have known what the protocol was and they would have followed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3138.945s">So</a> absent of that protocol, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3141.627s">They</a> made their judgment on what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3144.77s">In</a> hindsight, we all believe it was not the right judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3148.715s">But</a> I don't think if you reflect as an individual, everybody would say, I absolutely would have called the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3155.942s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3156.543s">So</a> my final point in closing is that my issue is I believe we have an issue with transparency and approachability. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3165.177s">There</a> were people and there are people that are resident stakeholders and subject matter experts who have raised the issue over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3173.542s">And</a> they've been disregarded and they've been silenced because some people don't know what they don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3179.785s">And</a> the only way you're going to get that information is if you allow people to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3184.607s">There's</a> a dedicated focus in this city to urbanize the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3189.27s">And</a> we need to, in conjunction with that effort, if it will move forward, do what needs to be done <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3195.119s">to</a> prepare us for what urbanization means. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3198.041s">This</a> event is a wake-up call to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3202.005s">This</a> administration in this city needs to become fully transparent and participative immediately, at all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3209.871s">It</a> should be clear to everyone at this moment, in this time, that in a disaster situation, we would and will be lacking in the essentials we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3219.678s">Unless</a> this administration's approach to planning and implementation is overhauled immediately, I urge you to become familiar with the steps and frameworks other cities and communities are taking to investigate these, not just a single, but an overarching. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3237.829s">We</a> need to focus on this crucial item swiftly, but with decisive, methodical, measured approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3245.454s">Change</a> is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3247.587s">Planning</a> is tedious, but we as a community can rise to the challenge, if not for our children, then for who? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3256.11s">Please</a> look at this as a holistic issue and not just cherry pick. <a

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11127.455s">I'm</a> sorry, another busy night for me.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11130.757s">Gene</a> Yuzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11132.717s">I</a> have to say, when the night first began, that I was skeptical and thought that this was a really bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11140.101s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11141.702s">Simply</a> because it abuts a property that's a residential property, and I think that, as others have said, it is important that you have quiet enjoyment of your premises. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11152.967s">But</a> then I watched the presentation, <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11155.888s">and</a> the details of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11158.571s">The</a> fact that they're going to have double walls of fencing that have insulation between them to help buffer the sound of the dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11168.919s">The</a> fact that they're going to have <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11170.5s">the</a> largest trees they possibly can install in the back to create a barrier that separates that residential unit from the new property that they're looking to put. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11183.406s">And</a> the fact that they're going to also do insulation internally <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11187.928s">and</a> do some traffic control with the animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11190.649s">And</a> to me, it seems that of all of the different presentations I've seen over the past few years, for businesses and residents and various developments, that aside from one other that I can think of, this one has been very thoughtfully put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11208.514s">And</a> so, I would say at this juncture, I'm leaning more towards looking at the fact that it's an industrial place <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11217.859s">They're</a> looking to use it in an industrial or commercial use, which is what it's intended for, and we can look to find a way to work with them together as a business that isn't a negative or net negative solution as residential units tend to be because it costs more to educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11238.162s">children</a> in those apartments than it does for a commercial property to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11243.146s">We</a> need a delicate balance between. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11245.668s">And</a> this group of individuals are coming to the city of Medford because they see that as an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11253.054s">And</a> we have other things that are looking to go on Locust Street that we say shouldn't be there because Locust Street is industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11264.118s">We've</a> got a bit of a mixed message going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11268.183s">I</a> would think that, you know, if it's the overnight issue that's truly the issue, it's a nominal amount of the business for this group of people, perhaps they would be willing to rethink that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11281.957s">And</a> although it's a million dollar investment, I'm sure that a gradual increase, not 100 dogs, not 50 right away, but maybe you look at 25 or 30, and you revisit it in three or six months for that additional 25 or 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11297.598s">It's</a> a give and take. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11298.578s">There</a> has to be a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11300.179s">And</a> I feel like there could be a compromise to be reached here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11304.08s">And</a> I hope that you guys consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=11306.581s">And</a> with that said, if we can find a middle ground, I would think that it would be a great thing for the city of Medford.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=12969.852s">I</a> only have one last thought to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=12973.674s">We</a> can either talk tonight about some type of special variance for dogs, or we'll be at the ZBA in a couple of months talking about another 10 story building.<h2><a href="../2017-06-21_7NOaplsgIuU/2017-06-21_7NOaplsgIuU.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 20, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2885.498s">Hi,</a> G News 035 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2887.179s">If</a> I may, through the chair, just a question on clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2890.502s">When</a> Alicia was going over the details of the borings that were going to happen, I believe she indicated there were four that were going to go down to groundwater level. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2901.369s">And</a> I'm just curious if we're testing that groundwater at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2905.512s">And</a> if so, what type of additional implications could that open up for that same area? <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2910.976s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2911.737s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2923.308s">Are</a> we testing the groundwater? <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2926.911s">I</a> couldn't hear the end of it.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4518.846s">I</a> feel like every meeting that I attend and I watch, we hear more and more about the onslaught that our residents and small business are facing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4533.713s">And</a> I think it's becoming crucial that we demand that these folks that are working within our city limits reach out and communicate effectively <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4548.505s">with</a> the people whose lives they're impacting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4551.706s">And</a> in an area like Boston Ave, that isn't necessarily just the Butters or people in the general neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4559.328s">That's</a> a main area that people traverse through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4562.469s">There</a> should be communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4564.19s">There</a> should be transparencies for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4567.671s">And</a> there should be representation of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4571.412s">We</a> really are, for lack of a better phrase, under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4577.14s">Everyone</a> is feeling it across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4579.341s">They're</a> feeling it on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4581.341s">They're</a> feeling it up on Winthrop Street by the high school where there's demolition going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4587.703s">Salem</a> Street is getting set to feel its pains with the Break Pro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4593.824s">I</a> don't know if that statement has come out yet, but we expect that to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4599.265s">And</a> yet, we continue to see the South Street area they're under attack to by <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4607.311s">their</a> onslaught of development that's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4609.213s">But</a> we continue to see these groups, teams, and individuals come into our city and run roughshod over everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4618.879s">And</a> yes, gentrification is underway, but we certainly don't have to sit back and just accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4624.423s">And</a> gentrification isn't only going to occur to just our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4630.567s">It's</a> going to occur to our businesses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4633.26s">And</a> so we talk about things like how to revitalize Medford Square and bring back small businesses, where you hear about organizations and companies that are suffering because their foot traffic and vehicle traffic is being removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4649.17s">We</a> look at someone like Carol's, who's been under onslaught now for months upon months with bridge work that's going to extend and extend and extend. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4659.196s">And</a> it troubles me greatly because we <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4663.393s">keep</a> discussing these things, and the situation seemingly is getting worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4669.775s">We</a> talk about things like development committees made up of residents, and I think we talked about that weeks ago now, haven't heard a word back about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4679.778s">So,</a> you know, I've said it before, I'll say it again, zoning, development, yes, there are departments that are involved, but the purview of it resides with this <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4695.3s">And</a> I would urge you, if we don't do something as a group to set limits and insist upon the rules of engagement for these folks, it's going to come to a head somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4710.844s">And</a> I just, that in conjunction with the airplanes and everything, it's just, it's crazy right now in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4718.826s">And</a> we look to you guys because we know how <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4723.032s">Much</a> you all love the city like we do but it's Next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4726.655s">It's</a> going to be someone else coming up, you know there's always something going on and until unless and until we insist that they have those communication plans and Use the proper methods to communicate them effectively Throughout the city when appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=4746.828s">It's</a> just going to continue to go on Thank you
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7674.272s">Jean,</a> 35 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7677.394s">The</a> last time we spoke about potholes, I told you all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7680.755s">I</a> didn't know the last time Paris Street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7683.476s">Someone</a> reached out and advised me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7685.938s">But</a> the last time Parris Street was paved, they watched it from the window of the Curtis School as Beatlemania hit the United States in 1964. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7694.024s">So</a> that's the last time Parris Street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7697.266s">So</a> I'm not surprised to hear that within the next century, we may only see another 50 of Medford's roads attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7706.413s">I</a> find it interesting that 30 roads have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7708.934s">And</a> through the chair, I'd be curious to know if a single one on the north side of Medford has been done, because I <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7715.878s">have</a> said repeatedly that our side of the city has really seen no attention whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7722.319s">Not</a> roads, not sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7725.1s">But</a> it sounds like maybe that's not a bad thing based upon the committee of the whole meeting tonight that we heard about the poor quality of the hot top and asphalt that is coming out probably for any number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7739.843s">But</a> 1964 was the last time Parry Street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7745.038s">We</a> have not really had our potholes attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7747.819s">So</a> I would love to see some additional funding put towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7752.961s">And</a> I don't want to be greedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7756.462s">I</a> would even be happy with key cut, properly filled potholes, rather than potholes that have some attention given to them as a band-aid for the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7768.465s">So</a> I think many people might say, <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7773.759s">to</a> spread that across a little bit more and have equitable repair of those potholes that are causing the most damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7782.906s">It</a> does not have to be in one place, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7786.789s">But</a> again, 1964 was the last time our streets saw any attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7792.754s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=7793.054s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1332.249s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1332.81s">Nuzzo,</a> 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1336.014s">I</a> just want to go on the record, too, that Parris Street was also listed as a street that was supposed to be addressed this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1343.659s">I</a> wouldn't get into a debate about what street is worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1346.861s">I</a> think on our side of Medford, we have a lot of very what I call depressed streets that haven't really been attended to, the street nor the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1358.732s">There's</a> a hole that has been in front of my house for 46 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1363.453s">We</a> haven't been able to, I mean, it's kind of laughable, but it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1367.474s">It</a> keeps getting larger and larger and larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1370.234s">Our</a> elderly community on our street won't walk, cannot walk down the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1374.895s">It's</a> abhorrent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1376.695s">And</a> often when we attend these dialogues and discussions about development, we hear these developers tell us that our neighborhoods are depressed and blighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1387.32s">It</a> really boils down to our streets not being able to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1391.663s">So</a> I know we've got a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1394.324s">I'd</a> ask that you consider Parris Street and maybe a few more of those surrounding streets in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1401.629s">It's</a> been quite a while since they've been attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1406.231s">And</a> I think it would go a long way for a number of elderly people we have, as well as mobily challenged folks in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1416.153s">You</a> know, our area of Medford, I think the last time I checked, we have like 45% of the people who live in North and East Medford that are senior and disabled and lower income. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1428.878s">So</a> it's harder for them to get around because not all of them do have cars and they like to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1433.62s">So</a> again, I know you've got a meeting coming up Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1437.321s">I'd</a> like to attend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1438.742s">And</a> I'm looking forward to that dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1441.823s">But</a> if you could consider our area as well, that would be great.

<a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2220.884s">Recognizing</a> that budget is always a concern in this day and age, and recognizing that some streets need to be put off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2227.828s">If</a> we could even be successful in our pothole repair, so currently what they'll do if you're fortunate enough to have a pothole filled, they'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2236.954s">They'll</a> fill it, and they'll tamp it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2239.535s">But</a> that's not actually the right way to repair a pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2242.357s">You're</a> supposed to actually cut so many inches, a surgeon would call it the clear margin, <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2247.937s">Cut</a> so many inches and then you re-tamp and you fill with a square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2252.461s">If</a> we made those types of repairs, the roads would look less like patchwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2257.661s">and</a> you'd feel potholes less, because when they're patched, they'd be patched more appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2264.184s">And</a> then the secondary, and possibly more important thing we could do, and occasionally I hear it, when different developers step before you, when they fall under your purview, but what we should do overall, is we should never let anybody who's opening our street <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2281.479s">open</a> up a one-foot trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2283.82s">They</a> need to open up a minimum width for a minimum duration so that they have the appropriate space to reset and tamp down, put in the subsoil, put in the proper layers of the different products that are required depending upon where they're working at the right grade so that you don't wind up with the puddle and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2306.687s">And</a> I can forward <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2308.368s">to</a> all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2309.028s">Some</a> of you may be aware, but I'm happy to share with you some general links to help you get a little bit more up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2314.31s">But</a> I think regardless of where we go with our repair of streets, we can do no harm, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2323.013s">So</a> when we open up our streets and we're working in our streets, if we require folks that are doing this work, and they know how to make those repairs because in other cities <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2331.94s">they</a> wouldn't dare open up the street for a foot and a half for, you know, four or five feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2337.082s">They'd</a> open it up properly and they'd, you know, reset to existing or better condition the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2345.286s">And</a> they also wouldn't use hot top patches on the sidewalk where there's concrete, where we've had some upgrades done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2352.789s">I've</a> noticed that <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2355.03s">I</a> think it might have been NSTAR that did the gas upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2358.493s">They</a> would cut out the street, the sidewalk, dig that hole out, and they wouldn't properly set the patch and put concrete back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2367.119s">They'd</a> just tamp in hot top like someone was going to come later. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2370.982s">And</a> we've got some of those on Paris Street that go down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2374.404s">There's</a> probably <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2375.985s">30</a> or 40 of them at least, maybe even one for every single address where they tie into the different homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2381.55s">But</a> those few measures don't really reside back with us, our budget, taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2388.528s">It</a> resides to the projects that are being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2391.189s">And</a> as a city, if we require those things, then our streets are going to look better because we're requiring that people working in them maintain and return them to us in a condition that we're not going to have to be doing repair work in two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2407.515s">So</a> I just wanted to raise that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2408.795s">And</a> if anyone's interested, I'm happy to share some of those links. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=2411.416s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4808.965s">Gene</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4811.466s">I</a> can only advise you, as I have in the past, having attended these community development meetings and zoning board meetings, when you attend, there's no real effort made to make sure that residents are able to see the documentation, can clearly hear the documentation, presenters are regularly advised, speak to the board, <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4838.265s">And</a> often, when you're sitting in the audience, you'll have a back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4842.808s">So</a> anyone with experience in transformational change and change management understands that the best way to deal with pushback and resistance is to make sure that expectations are set. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4857.16s">And</a> I think this is another example of the right equipment in these rooms and the right opportunities presented to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4867.01s">abutters</a> in neighborhoods get to hear what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4870.753s">Maybe</a> this could have been avoided and people could have been less upset about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4876.016s">And</a> I think it's also a good case for more transparency in this documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4882.621s">Right</a> now, if a resident wanted to know about that project, they would have to go down to the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4891.086s">They'd</a> have to request to see the documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4894.051s">They'd</a> have to be allowed to have that documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4896.753s">It</a> would have to be readily available and not under review somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4900.356s">And</a> you would have to do it right there in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4902.718s">And</a> for a lot of people, they're not out of work and home before four or five o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4907.481s">So</a> it becomes very difficult for us to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4910.083s">So</a> I know previously we've had some conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4913.486s">I</a> think it was in one of the subcommittee meetings about some <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4918.282s">software</a> that's available that would make some of these things.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4935.611s">I</a> think this is the product you're talking about.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4938.753s">Yeah,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4939.473s">And</a> so maybe one of the things people might want to ask them is if there's <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4944.458s">module</a> that would allow for a mechanism for these documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4947.659s">I</a> know some surrounding cities, even Melrose and Malden, have a good portion of theirs readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4954.222s">I</a> don't know if it's through Google Docs or Excel, but I think it would go a long way because most people, if they have the opportunity to see it, their expectations are set. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4963.945s">They're</a> not surprised driving home from work, and it keeps from having emotions elevated because they have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4970.647s">So</a> I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4972.988s">software</a> or some Google Docs solution, maybe temporarily, coupled with maybe some technology, simple technology in the room so that people can hear a little better, even if it's a lapel microphone and a speaker, could go pretty far with some of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=4989.703s">But</a> just so you have that information, because I've attended a lot, and I know you guys have other ones you go to, and you don't always get to be at those.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_Buu0dDHgsRo/2017-10-05_Buu0dDHgsRo.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 16, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4044.809s">Jean</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4046.729s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4047.409s">I</a> have a bit of a cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4050.11s">So</a> being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4057.833s">And</a> I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4067.036s">Currently,</a> today, the city of Medford has 13 properties <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4072.338s">listed</a> for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4073.901s">Thirteen,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4076.326s">Of</a> those thirteen, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4084.51s">Four</a> are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized, and the remaining eight are listed single or two-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4096.001s">Of</a> those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4104.412s">So</a> that's what's going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4106.574s">It</a> is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4124.687s">That's</a> what's happening in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4128.141s">Another</a> pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4135.906s">Well,</a> what's a price-to-rent ratio? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4138.327s">It's</a> where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4151.017s">The</a> city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4153.94s">There</a> are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4161.287s">Beacon</a> Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4166.352s">Cambridge</a> and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4170.676s">This</a> is a measure of gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4173.319s">What</a> is gentrification? <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4175.421s">It</a> is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4185.43s">That</a> mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4208.816s">So</a> this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4213.841s">Back</a> Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4217.484s">Those</a> are some pretty significant price point opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4221.888s">And</a> I don't discourage those types of price points. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4224.491s">I</a> think in the nature of real estate, they're critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4227.814s">But</a> we're getting a false inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4230.416s">that's</a> happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4245.27s">What's</a> critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4259.581s">And</a> because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4265.485s">So</a> they're making all profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4267.606s">So</a> there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4280.193s">It's</a> simply not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for non-conforming units to put in another two-family or three-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4293.34s">Because</a> those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4297.104s">That's</a> not what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4298.445s">That's</a> not what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4300.668s">Not</a> unless we make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4303.29s">We</a> as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking as part of their process to preserve <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4314.562s">both</a> building and green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4317.043s">And</a> yet, we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put up these fast, prefabbed, fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick-built construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4337.695s">They're</a> not bringing jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4339.316s">They're</a> simply lining their pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4341.417s">in</a> my opinion and my observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4344.28s">So</a> I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4349.104s">And</a> the message is, the line is drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4352.307s">We</a> welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4357.112s">that</a> come with a desire to collaborate and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4364.676s">And</a> I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4370.8s">Now</a> it's

two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4375.923s">whatever,</a> but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4383.307s">That</a> we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4397.314s">Thank</a> you for your time.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5760.952s">Jean</a> Izzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5762.053s">I</a> know I've spoken already. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5763.253s">I'll</a> be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5764.173s">I</a> would just like to raise two points of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5767.434s">The</a> first is simply by passing this, that doesn't give a designation to every home as a historical property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5775.356s">It</a> just affords the committee the opportunity to review and decide whether a house is of historical significance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5784.019s">The</a> second point I'd like to raise with regard to families who've aged here <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5789.025s">and</a> have dwindled off to the last survivors or beneficiaries to benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5796.568s">Nobody</a> lives in Medford and says, I live on a double lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5799.27s">Ooh,</a> when I die, my beneficiaries are going to make a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5803.251s">What's</a> happening here is the developers coming in, seeing the opportunity, they're giving them market value. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5809.434s">and</a> they're making the profit all for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5811.575s">So</a> the argument, I'm sorry to say, has some holes in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5816.796s">The</a> people who are benefiting are not really the people who are selling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5820.818s">It's</a> the developers who are coming in and taking advantage of those properties because they're able to identify them and they understand the non-conforming and variance rules and how to work with the ZBA and what to do with the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5835.902s">It's</a> not residents that are making that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=5837.883s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE/2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 21, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8063.266s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8063.726s">Jean</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8066.448s">I</a> think it's no secret that I am extremely passionate about both Medford and its development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8075.772s">I</a> am totally heartened to see this come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8081.154s">I</a> think it is one of the most critical <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8083.587s">responsibilities</a> that the City Council holds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8087.089s">Residents</a> of this city make a social contract when we purchase here that where we purchase will stay similar, not the same, but similar to where we buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8099.297s">And</a> I think that we are in some ways under attack from developers around us that are starting to come in and cannibalize us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8109.143s">I'm</a> concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8110.598s">for</a> people who've made the decision to age in place here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8115.579s">We</a> historically have people come and stay for generations and that is with thought, not by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8123.781s">And</a> I feel that if we're not careful, those families are going to be pushed out and Medford will be gentrified just as Somerville has been gentrified and Cambridge before it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8135.208s">I</a> think Medford is in an enviable position. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8138.311s">When</a> you look at the surrounding cities, they don't have the green spaces that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8142.556s">When</a> you look at their green maps, their teeny dots across the city, little islands, Medford has whole areas where we don't have development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8153.007s">And</a> I think we have an opportunity to be very purposeful about what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8158.169s">I</a> always liken Medford to a diamond in the rough, because I do believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8164.072s">If</a> you know a jeweler, they won't cleave a diamond until they're sure of what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8169.054s">And</a> Medford has areas that are ripe for development, but it should be development that we deem necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8176.957s">And</a> so I would encourage <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8179.161s">this</a> council to continue to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8182.282s">And</a> I would put forth for your consideration that we have a great deal of subject matter expertise within our city limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8190.124s">There</a> are many people who are very passionate about this specific topic and have good visions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8195.445s">I've</a> talked with some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8197.186s">I've</a> heard of some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8198.686s">And</a> I think that we have committees for Walk Medford, Bike Medford, the arts, but we do not have a citizen representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8209.205s">for</a> development, which is the critical thing for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8213.686s">And</a> I really think that that's one thing that's lacking because a good and meaningful committee or coalition of Medford residents with some subject matter expertise can help you in that, you know, and bring to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8227.328s">It's</a> a big undertaking, but I'm glad to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8230.589s">And</a> again, I would stress that in my mind and in my opinion, it is one of the most crucial things <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8238.088s">the</a> crucial contracts that you have between your constituents, that you're going to, you know, look to protect the interest of the Medford residents, recognizing that developers coming in are buying and they're property owners, but they're not the same type of property owners that are going to be here and stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8255.131s">They're</a> going to turn the property around and make their profit and usually leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8260.072s">So,</a> I'm very encouraged to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8261.832s">I</a> appreciate the positive thoughts and I hope that we continue in this forward movement.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9131.112s">G.</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, right around the corner from Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9134.715s">This</a> is my neighborhood, so I feel doubly strongly about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9139.558s">Again,</a> as far as I can tell from all of the readings and all of my interactions in various cities that are structured similarly, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9149.679s">Zoning</a> starts with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9152.16s">With</a> all respect, I'm disinterested in what the mayor's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9156.242s">I'm</a> disinterested in what the community development's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9159.664s">And</a> I'm disinterested at some level of what the ZBA's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9162.905s">This</a> is the neighborhood that we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9165.826s">We</a> are the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9167.267s">We</a> are the people who will drive by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9169.708s">We</a> are the people who will sit in the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9172.109s">We</a> are the people that as these buildings go up will deal with the power outages. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9175.951s">We</a> just had one not a week ago on Tuesday that was for hours for some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9182.635s">It's</a> getting into the shower and not getting proper water supply because we're already getting developed more than we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9189.818s">It's</a> sewer systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9191.599s">It's</a> backing up the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9193.12s">It's</a> the fact that when you drive down the streets in our neighborhood, people are cutting through because they're trying to avoid <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9199.823s">93,</a> and with the fast 14, the entire state has learned how to cut through the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9205.648s">So</a> I mean, I think that we can't handle the additional volume that we're hearing someone somewhere is envisioning in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9215.936s">I</a> mean, it looks like Beirut. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9217.538s">It</a> looks like they test missiles around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9219.84s">The</a> potholes are so big it'll eat a Subaru. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9222.502s">So</a> I get that it's considered somewhat <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9225.907s">blighted,</a> although I take exception to that term because it's blighted because it hasn't been cared for properly in budgeting, budgetary planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9235.389s">So</a> I don't think that, you know, having a vision of putting 15, 20 of these down Stalem Street is really going to do anybody any favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9246.732s">I</a> think we're going to get into a situation where the people who live in the neighborhood, their properties are going to be devalued because they're not going to be these new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9256.616s">We're</a> going to be dwarfed by these big buildings coming down Salem Street, and we're going to be gentrified out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9262.698s">People</a> who have been in those neighborhoods for two and three generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9266.439s">families</a> that are young and have bought in because they like the neighborhood and they like the small feel of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9272.453s">So</a> respectfully, I understand that there are different groups that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9277.551s">have</a> political, optical interests at play, but when it comes nine o'clock at night, they don't put their head on the pillow, you know, in the various areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9287.933s">It's</a> just where they live, and I don't see any big circles being drawn around where their houses are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9293.514s">So</a> I would ask that you make this a top priority, because they are lining up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9299.835s">There</a> is a scuttlebutt. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9301.596s">We're</a> starting to see some construction happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9304.296s">We</a> started to see a few people apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9306.997s">Some,</a> it looks like, are going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9308.757s">Some</a> looks like they may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9310.158s">I'm</a> not sure what the rhyme or reason will be, but it would be very unfortunate to see an area that has some beautiful buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9318.38s">Some</a> of the buildings in our neighborhood are quite lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9320.961s">you</a> know, be taken away and have it turn out to look like Main Street in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9326.345s">Not</a> that there's anything wrong with Main Street in Cambridge, but that was Cambridge's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9330.147s">I</a> don't want it to be a developer's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9332.249s">So</a> I know it's a little bit strong, my commentary, but I feel like our neighbourhood is really on the chopping block very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9343.413s">And</a> it will go like dominoes if we don't do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9346.676s">So</a> I would urge you to please consider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9349.858s">Because</a> for those of us who live there, it's heartbreaking for us to consider that it might not be there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9355.022s">Thanks.</a>

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3781.05s">Gene</a> Nuzzo, 35 Parish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3785.072s">I</a> have a few points as they pertain to finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3789.473s">We've</a> talked a lot about Prop 2.5 and tripping Prop 2.5, but no one has mentioned at all the offset of the maintenance of the systems that are in place <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3802.918s">for</a> the fire department if they wait another five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3806.139s">I</a> can't imagine that those costs will come down to continue to repair old equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3812.901s">So</a> there also has to be an offset value on the operating side of the equation that I don't hear being factored in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3823.624s">I</a> hear, and I'm glad to hear, <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3827.425s">that</a> discussions are underway about additional maintenance to these facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3832.728s">But</a> respectfully, the City of Medford does not do a good job at preventative maintenance anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3840.072s">So</a> our buildings wouldn't be in the conditions that they're in right now for fire and police, the two sides of these facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3848.357s">if</a> we had the proper preventative maintenance in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3852.921s">So</a> instead, we're doing these emergency repairs and these Band-Aid solutions, and they cost significantly more. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3859.065s">So</a> I'd be interested in hearing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3861.467s">Additionally,</a> with respect to finance, we're talking about $18 million with respect to the fire department getting a new facility at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3870.975s">I'm</a> hearing five or so years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3875.057s">The</a> escalation right now for construction sits at about 5%, and it's upticking since 2009, 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3882.4s">It</a> was in the negatives then. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3884.601s">It</a> started to tick back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3887.062s">And</a> it looks like it's increasing about a percent, a half a percent, depending upon the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3892.464s">So</a> five today, next year, five and a half to six, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3896.965s">And</a> that doesn't include if the current administration under <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3904.217s">If</a> President Trump passes anything to do with infrastructure, you're going to see those costs increase exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3910.381s">So</a> everyone's saying $18 million, but it's significantly more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3916.465s">So</a> again, I think there's a lot of complexities, and I respect that there are a lot of underlying issues that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3925.41s">I</a> think that also stresses the need to really look at this overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3932.957s">The</a> other point I would make with respect to committees and work groups, I think it's pivotal, and I'm glad to hear that the police will have representation among their membership as will fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3946.048s">However,</a> the mayor stood here last night and said it is potentially her intention to redevelop that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3953.175s">So</a> there should be some citizen represented on that committee as well, because if that parcel is going to go up for redevelopment, voters and taxpayers should have a say as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3963.579s">And</a> right now we don't have a good venue to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3970.302s">We</a> have some other committees that do a good job, but we don't have a citizen development committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3974.724s">So</a> if there are people at the table, there should be some folks that represent the general population to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3982.169s">who</a> and how they may redevelop that lot if the fire department moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3987.513s">And</a> the last point I wanted to make with respect to financing and schedule, in all of these conversations these past few minutes, I've heard repeatedly about the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=3999.263s">I've</a> heard repeatedly about what construction's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4002.726s">I'm</a> still not hearing anything about an OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4005.528s">And</a> an OPM will be able to help you guys navigate <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4008.66s">will</a> help to determine some value engineering and we'll put together that schedule you're looking for very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4015.886s">So</a> thank you for your time.<h2><a

 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2623.022s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2624.082s">So</a> did those lights get thrown out? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2626.023s">Are</a> those not the lights that are displayed?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2630.887s">So</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2634.61s">So</a> the reason that I'm stepping up is that I'd like to raise two points for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2641.383s">The</a> first that I understand that the building is under construction, there's renovations that are going to be underway, and that we've got a solution up that is a reasonable solution with the work that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2654.566s">But</a> I think in the review of the space as the construction continues, there's an opportunity to look at ways to retrofit those existing <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2663.562s">creations</a> from the Vogue students that have been very emotionally contributed. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2669.489s">There's</a> a sentimental value, not for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2672.585s">don't</a> have it personally, but I know that a lot of my fellow residents have expressed sentimental attachment to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2680.747s">And</a> I think that as part of that effort, as we look at making renovations, we should look to see if they can be refit. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2687.888s">And</a> then my other suggestion would be if they can't stay on the building or on the grounds, maybe we could do something where different pieces get put in different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2697.851s">Maybe</a> some could go <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2699.332s">to</a> the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2700.292s">Some</a> could go to Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2701.493s">So</a> it encourages people to traverse the city and look at them, rather than go down that freedom way just to Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2708.395s">I</a> think that's a fine solution for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2710.856s">But</a> those would be two things that I would hope that folks could consider getting some of it, if not all of it, back. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2717.438s">And</a> then, if not, maybe encouraging folks to go out and investigate other things that are in our city by way of these beautiful displays that the students have created over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2728.862s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6325.793s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6326.313s">Gina</a> Muzo, 35 Parish Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6329.214s">So,</a> I have a few points that concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6333.955s">As</a> this dialogue went back and forth, we'd been talking about soil contamination and a plume in the soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6342.317s">And</a> just now, offhandedly, someone said, it's our groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6348.435s">This</a> troubles me because if we're going to start injecting chemical into the ground to hopefully treat against these PECs, there's nothing to say that we're going to just disturb them and push them further into the groundwater and further contaminate spaces that may not already have a plume. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6367.187s">I</a> feel that what we need to do is an assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6371.891s">We</a> need to have a geological assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6374.565s">We</a> need to have geoscientists involved, and they need to assess specifically the chemical. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6380.47s">They</a> can assess specifically where that plume goes, and they can assess specifically how it enters into the groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6388.696s">At</a> the point where you're not just talking about soil, and you talk about groundwater, the implications of that <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6396.307s">in</a> that neighborhood, and not only that neighborhood, in abutting areas and under the water table becomes significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6403.231s">This</a> troubles me greatly. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6405.172s">It</a> troubles me greatly because I'm sure they've worked hard, but there's still a lot of unknowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6412.116s">And</a> to come up and say that the city is prepared to step forward and enter into a contract with the lowest bidder in a project that they're not sure how it's going to work, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6424.002s">troubles</a> me significantly as a project planner, as a project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6430.404s">It's</a> not the right way to approach it. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6432.685s">And</a> as a taxpayer, to spend $900,000 on a project that we're not sure is going to work <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6441.673s">after</a> already having a sunk cost of $200,000 plus an additional $200,000 surplus, this is a big project to have someone not have a clearer understanding when that clearer understanding can be attained with the proper consultancy services. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6463.762s">Thank</a> you.

Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3541.202s">I</a> live at 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3544.343s">I</a> would like to just take a few moments and reiterate a few thoughts that I made <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3548.695s">with</a> a much smaller audience last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3551.837s">Just</a> my research, I have some information to reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3555.319s">So</a> just as a point of information, a lot of what I have to say tonight I've researched, and they're facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3562.103s">They're</a> not <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3562.919s">Opinions</a> I'll tell you if I think I'm making an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3567.945s">Sorry,</a> so I've done a lot of research and I have some information to share First let me say that I'm a lifelong Medford resident and I think that that still means something I live in this city because I love it and <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3584.344s">I'm</a> passionate about Medford and our opportunities to develop the city, and I'm passionate about construction and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3591.91s">It</a> is the industry that I work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3593.972s">I</a> do construction planning and tenant improvement development work for several different industries, including biotech, government, academic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3603.96s">So</a> I see what other cities are doing locally and all the way down to Rhode Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3611.505s">So</a> I am fully in support of responsible development within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3617.928s">I</a> still believe, as I did last week, that there is a subset of Medford officials that feel like Medford is the ugly sister who can't get a date, and so we should just be happy that someone wants to dig in the ground and build something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3637.872s">reiterate</a> that that is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3640.575s">We</a> sit smack dab in the middle of something that has been dubbed the urban edge or the urban ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3648.422s">I</a> have documentation from NIOP, which is the building industry <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3656.489s">standards</a> that they talk about this book. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3658.93s">If</a> you're welcome to look at it, I can refer you to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3662.232s">It</a> is all the projects that are going on in Somerville, Charlestown, Medford, West Cambridge, Watertown, Alston, North Station, and speculated projects around to support the outward migration from the city of Cambridge and Boston proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3681.584s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3682.044s">If</a> you want to look at it, I've notated a couple pages of interest, but I think that's available online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3686.946s">If</a> you're interested, I'll let you borrow it or have a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3690.727s">I</a> bring this up because in both instances, the developer has said the reason that they need to build 490 units is because there's nothing else they can do with that parcel in an industrial code. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3705.801s">that</a> it's zoned for industrial, and because Wegmans is coming across the street, they can't put another retail unit there, and there's nothing else they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3716.003s">So</a> if you look at that book, there's at least 150 projects going on, some residential, mostly mixed use, some office, some lab space. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3728.726s">I</a> have additional information that talks about what the market will bear, and values for rental, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3736.127s">for</a> the city of Medford or Cambridge, the surrounding areas in New England, and what the rents are, and the fact that, as I stated last week, there is now 115,000 square feet of lab space available in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3756.604s">So</a> they have a demand for over a million four square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3762.467s">They</a> have 114,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3763.247s">As</a> you look through that book, you'll notice that Watertown, Belmont, the surrounding areas are all doing things to bring business into their cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3775.592s">Again,</a> I'm not opposed to a residential development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3778.733s">Their</a> position was it has to be residential, and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3782.612s">my</a> findings and my information that I know of at the moment that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3787.655s">You're</a> welcome to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3789.195s">I</a> can refer you to links, whatever you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3792.377s">So</a> again, I'm fully in support of responsible development for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3798.18s">I</a> think we have a great opportunity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3800.721s">I'm</a> confused as to why this application for variance was considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3806.364s">As</a> was stated, there are three arguments really don't <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3811.836s">hold</a> merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3813.197s">So</a> the arguments that they make about the city needing to give them a variance because the land is brownfield and they can't dig. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3824.567s">I</a> mean, World Trade Center 1 that came out of the ground has what they call a bathtub. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3831.753s">It's</a> submerged in water. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3833.214s">I</a> think there are things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3835.296s">They</a> don't have to go so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3836.757s">But</a> again, I think it's just another example of <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3842.002s">perspective</a> that they bring to the argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3845.584s">So</a> I think that there are things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3847.825s">They</a> don't have to build that way, as I mentioned last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3850.267s">They</a> can do what they call a Texas wrap, which doesn't involve going into the earth at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3856.45s">And</a> I didn't see anything in the documentation about presumptive load testing to assure that this property can even hold a 75-foot multi-story building on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3868.537s">It</a> hasn't held that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3871.343s">And</a> in all the documentation that I looked at, I didn't see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3874.504s">I</a> may have overlooked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3875.645s">It</a> may be misplaced and just not in the copies that I was looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3878.946s">But</a> I think that's something extremely important to consider for a building that they want to go 75 feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3886.581s">I'm</a> concerned the Butters weren't impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3889.502s">I</a> know that in other cities that follow the Massachusetts general law, a Butters and their feedback are prominent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3898.144s">I</a> know of instances in both residential and commercial that when direct to Butters have said no, the matter is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3907.126s">It's</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3907.986s">So</a> I feel <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3910.187s">badly</a> that our abutters haven't had the opportunity and maybe they'd be more interested and open to this building had they had the opportunity to provide feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3922.531s">So</a> I think that moving forward with the project this large and not making it clear that this is not something that Medford residents want sets the stage and it sets the precedence that <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3938.814s">people</a> can come in and develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3940.815s">And</a> I mentioned last week, and I'll mention again for the benefit of the people who weren't here, that I know that there is a desire or human nature to say, well, that's a little bit further away from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3954.961s">It</a> might not affect me so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3956.981s">And</a> that may be true of this 490-unit development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3962.163s">But</a> just off the top of my head, I can think of four parcels, one on Riverside Ave, one on Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3969.238s">One</a> on High Street and actually a good number on Mystic Ave that a greedy developer or a savvy developer can come in and you will see multiples of this type of building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3985.477s">go</a> up, where they maximize what they're putting, they know the board, they know community development, and I know they work hard, and I believe that they have the best interests of the city at heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4000.184s">It's</a> a thankless job that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4002.606s">I</a> take my hat off. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4003.946s">I</a> don't know that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4005.581s">ever</a> want to do that job, but if it's known that this will be accepted and approved very swiftly in the city of Medford, you will see them come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4021.545s">So</a> I'd ask people to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4023.725s">Is</a> that what your vision is for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4026.586s">And</a> if it is, you know, well then certainly stand up and be heard on that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4031.392s">And</a> if it's not, you know, we need to kind of step forward and make it known that this one we may or may not be able to do something about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4040.563s">It</a> may or may not go our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4042.899s">But</a> the next one, we're gonna mobilize, we're gonna be ready, we're gonna be united, and we're gonna try to influence and make sure that our voices are heard before that schematic design is completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4057.667s">I</a> would also urge your consideration, and I don't know how the best way to go about this would be, but I feel like we need some subject matter expertise in Medford on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4071.654s">There</a> are some savvy developers out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4073.575s">There</a> are some really good developers out there that would be interested in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4078.699s">And,</a> you know, just by way of accepting this one, I think that we could use a little bit more strength in that expertise.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4088.547s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4089.227s">I</a> can finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4091.229s">As</a> I said, if anyone's interested in the market information, I'm happy to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4094.991s">I</a> think we need some subject matter experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4097.073s">And</a> then in closing, I'll leave you with this thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4100.635s">It</a> may cost us $15,000 to file an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4105.238s">It</a> may cost us $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4106.939s">But</a> how much will it cost the taxpayers for that 490-unit development going in? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4112.302s">that</a> we will drive by every day, deal with the traffic, pay for the children that need to go to school, and any other taxing that they put on our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4121.527s">So</a> I think in the grand scheme, $15,000, $30,000 is not a lot to invest to at least influence the outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4130.471s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8027.103s">I</a> was just speaking with someone and they asked me to come up and point out that in all of the development, if we could start to consider a little bit more religiously our seniors and senior development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8043.962s">they</a> seem to be being left out of the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8047.485s">I</a> know that when they met with the council, I'm sorry, the board, there was a question on low income, there was a question on veteran, but we seem to be forgetting about our aging population and they account for, I believe, according to the latest census, roughly 38 to 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8065.179s">And</a> then, I don't know if this will be a popular suggestion, but <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8069.883s">If</a> we could be made aware, if the funds aren't made available, perhaps we could set up a Medford Advocacy GoFundMe page to support the efforts if we had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8079.87s">I</a> think that that would be a donation well spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=8083.233s">So</a> just something to consider.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10394.795s">Hi,</a> Gina Muzo, 35 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10397.515s">Um,</a> I just have one quick comment and then a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10401.097s">I</a> think I understand what our city solicitor is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10405.705s">The</a> example I would give would be if you went to seek counsel for a car accident and it became known in your initial consultation that the lawyer you were seeking counsel from represented that particular client in another accident, they couldn't represent you in your accident because they're already engaged as representation, and so it creates an appearance of a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10434.308s">So</a> I think that probably illustrates what you're trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10438.931s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10440.412s">My</a> question, if you could just provide clarity for me, is it 20 calendar days or 20 business days?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10457.481s">And</a> then the only other thought I had, which I'm not certain is, is there any <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10462.587s">avenue</a> for us before we go to land court or superior court to appeal the Board of Appeals directly as an internal body, you know, rather than have the family fight in public forum, maybe have that discussion internally? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10479.599s">And</a> I don't know the answer to that, but I'd raise that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10484.082s">In</a> other words, can the city council appeal the Board of Appeals decision, or do they have to go to land court? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10490.725s">Is</a> there an appeal process within the Board of Appeals?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10503.967s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10504.287s">So</a> they never appeal directly to the Board of Appeals?
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10512.369s">You</a> appeal to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10513.289s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10513.649s">I</a> just wanted to make sure we couldn't just keep it in the family.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks/2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 7, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1935.768s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jean Nuzzo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1938.77s">I'm</a> Jean Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1940.751s">I</a> live at 35 Paris street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1943.172s">I</a> thank you for your time tonight to hear our concerns about this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1948.355s">Um,</a> first I'd like to tell you that I am a lifelong Medford resident by choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1953.437s">Um,</a> I purposefully made the choice when it came time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1957.599s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1958.3s">I</a> purposefully, how's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1964.128s">So</a> I purposefully made the choice to stay in Medford and it is my desire and intent to age here and remain here a lifelong resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1973.553s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1975.473s">I'm</a> passionate about Medford and I am very passionate about construction and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1981.036s">It</a> is what I do for a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1984.918s">So</a> to say I'm fully in support of responsible development of the city <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1989.963s">of</a> Medford would be an understatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1992.727s">I</a> see our city as beautiful, even in its dusty and dirty state. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1998.474s">I</a> love it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2000.336s">I</a> do, however, believe that there are some people, rather than seeing Medford as a diamond <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2008.837s">that</a> should be studied before it's cut apart and turned into something as merely the ugly sister who can't get a date so we should accept whatever developer comes in and wants to put a building up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2022.081s">And</a> that is what this feels like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2025.342s">I'm</a> confused as to why our Board of Appeals entertained this application for the duration that they did <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2035.925s">or</a> the amount of time that was given to them the night of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2041.688s">We</a> were there very late. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2043.609s">They</a> had the floor for a majority of the meeting, and when the residents got up to speak, I would say by about 10.30, they kind of cut off <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2056.164s">folks</a> because it was, in fact, getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2059.789s">But</a> I'm confused as to why the application for the variance was considered because the request doesn't meet the requirements of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 48, Section 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2071.183s">The</a> three arguments that they made are invalid. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2075.22s">Their</a> arguments were that they needed relief because the property was brownfield property, but they purchased it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2083.063s">They</a> made the argument that because of the groundwater underneath, they could not put underground parking, so they had to build the structure higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2091.726s">However,</a> they could do as they're doing on Rivers Edge, the new development by Davis. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2098.928s">They're</a> doing what they call a Texas wrap. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2101.429s">So</a> they put the parking in the middle and the units around the perimeter so you don't have to go into the ground at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2108.311s">And</a> then the third position I heard from them was that they could not find a commercial solution for the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2117.445s">that</a> they had looked but nobody was interested because of the Wegmans building going across the street and because of its location. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2127.93s">Although</a> Assembly Row, which has 441 units and 256,000 square feet of retail space is going into its phase two development and will gain another 157,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2145.606s">putting</a> it just shy of 500,000 square feet of retail space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2151.271s">They,</a> if they could find a way to build more buildings and put more retail, they could lease more space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2157.396s">So</a> I would ask, and I did ask, why then they couldn't find more retail? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2164.361s">In</a> addition to that, the city of Cambridge has a deficit of life science property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2170.546s">And</a> there is a outward migration, not only of residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2175.222s">but</a> of Cambridge businesses in the smaller life science groups that are moving out to Somerville and Belmont and Watertown, which are all further away than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2187.524s">So</a> I would argue that their positions were perhaps not as well thought out of what the marketplace would actually bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2195.966s">I</a> think there's good opportunity for Medford to avail themselves of this potential type of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2203.784s">I'd</a> also like to point out for your consideration that although the abutters will be impacted and they were in attendance, those that were there expressed the fact that they were never provided an opportunity to participate in the development or provide feedback on any portion of the design of that unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2222.26s">The</a> first time they were seeing it was either at the community development meeting or at <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2229.625s">at</a> the variance application meeting, that hearing that we were in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2234.848s">And</a> I did attend both. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2235.909s">I</a> attended the development board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2238.25s">I</a> attended the board of appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2243.113s">In</a> both instances, residents expressed the desire to reject this application and that it wasn't good for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2249.918s">And</a> in both instances, everybody was looking to come to <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2255.775s">a</a> compromise, asking them to make it smaller, to design it more to the intent of what Medford architecture looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2265.465s">a</a> bit belligerent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2266.506s">They</a> were very sure they were going to get their variance and they didn't really care to listen to what Medford residents had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2273.271s">I'd</a> also like to point out that I think true public hearings are critical because although this affects the abutters, it affects the city, not just from a traffic perspective, but if we have this unit come in this large, that doesn't consider a strategic plan for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2295.611s">We</a> are inviting other developers of this type to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2301.392s">And</a> we miss the opportunity to work with some of the big developers that I'm feeling certain would be interested that have helped to develop some really landmark properties around the greater Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2315.456s">We</a> should really be looking to benefit from what they're calling the urban edge or the urban ring outward migration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2324.265s">We</a> are centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2326.547s">We,</a> you know, real estate, location, location, location. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2330.45s">So</a> we can either just take whatever comes our way, or we can really be mindful. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2337.315s">And</a> I'd like you to, if you've seen, I'm hoping you guys have all seen the rendering, it's a very tall building. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2343.38s">It's</a> 75 feet or so tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2346.482s">It's</a> glass, but the perimeter of the building matches the perimeter of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2351.987s">There</a> are few trees at the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2354.097s">but</a> the true courtyard space is reserved specifically for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2359.158s">I'd</a> like you to consider developments like that on High Street and Salem Street and Mystic Ave and Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2367.821s">I'd</a> like you to consider that if we let this unit go through, we are sending a signal to this type of developer that they can come in and put those units wherever they see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2379.884s">Now</a> certainly, I know that some people don't <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2383.691s">like</a> station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2385.012s">It</a> didn't turn out the way that we were all promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2388.014s">But</a> where it was located, it was not an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2392.977s">There</a> was nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2394.337s">So</a> what it was was better than a big barren field. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2400.281s">But</a> in these instances, we would be losing real estate opportunities to these huge developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2407.285s">And</a> I understand the need for housing, but I think that there's a balance that we should look to <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2413.067s">attain</a> and I urge you all to consider that and I would urge the people, residents sitting behind me in attendance and if there are folks watching at home, I would urge them to think about that and think about if this is their vision for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2432.866s">And</a> if not, I call you to action because now is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2437.049s">If</a> we do not step forward <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2439.075s">and</a> say, not in this way, not without purpose, then these developers will come, and Medford will be another type of city, and it may not be the type of city we want it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2452.066s">So</a> I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2453.888s">I'd</a> urge you to put forth a letter requesting the board to withhold a final judgment until the general public truly gets to speak on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2462.916s">Thank</a> you.
