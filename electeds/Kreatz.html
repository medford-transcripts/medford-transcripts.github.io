    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.061s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.962s">[Kreatz]</a>: We'd like it read, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: Pretz has some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=471.665s">[Kreatz]</a>: Superintendent, I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=493.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: But what I found out through e-mail communication was that's something that's not possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=499.92s">[Kreatz]</a>: Currently there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=505.842s">[Kreatz]</a>: or add an additional document, or attach a separate page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=510.484s">[Kreatz]</a>: So what they can do is the guidance Councilor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance Councilor write the personal accomplishments about the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=532.012s">[Kreatz]</a>: but you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=551.151s">[Kreatz]</a>: I thought it was going to be something different than what we motioned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=756.86s">[Kreatz]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=763.235s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's not an emergency matter but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=775.721s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just something really interesting but it's not an emergency report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=780.163s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like to make a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=810.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=811.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wanted to inquire about one shop in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=816.608s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was the robotics engineering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=818.508s">[Kreatz]</a>: Originally, the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=827.972s">[Kreatz]</a>: And just recently, there's been a development where there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=835.234s">[Kreatz]</a>: there is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=852.518s">[Kreatz]</a>: going out doing the college tours, and what we saw was at Wentworth, they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop, and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines, and in fact, we have newer machines than they have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=871.167s">[Kreatz]</a>: know, they have like a five access and we have a three access, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford vocational school has that equipment that's college ready and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops and they're starting out at $15 an hour<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=892.927s">[Kreatz]</a>: and that's what our vocational students are doing in that particular field, so I really think it's an important, you know, to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as, you know, the A week, B week program, and this was a new development that just came about, you know, recently for an opportunity for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=916.076s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to have that revisited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2179.562s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2184.644s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was great hearing from all of you It was just wonderful, and you know what great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2189.246s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're doing at the school and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2199.37s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2206.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2217.479s">[Kreatz]</a>: helped organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school, and it was just fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2222.385s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2226.29s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just love it there, and it's just a great school, and thank you all for what you do every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2230.835s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3605.587s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3605.767s">[Kreatz]</a>: Katz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3606.367s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi Dr. Rodelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3607.407s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say I really love this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3609.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it's absolutely fantastic and it's just gonna teach the students a very valuable life lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3615.209s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was just so interested and I really love Monopoly and it reminds me of the real life Monopoly game and I just love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3622.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: It just sounds like so much fun and some of the articles online that the students were faced with unexpected circumstances where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3629.952s">[Kreatz]</a>: their car breaks down and they have to make a decision on what are they going to do or their vet has to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3636.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry, their pet has to go to the vet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3639.138s">[Kreatz]</a>: But it just, it just sounds like so much fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3642.841s">[Kreatz]</a>: It really does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3643.821s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, it's going to be a valuable life lesson to learn how to balance a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3648.825s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I know a lot of, you know, students, my son's just learning how to do a checkbook and it's just so important to learn how to spend your money and manage it and pay bills and know what you have to take priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3660.052s">[Kreatz]</a>: But it's wonderful, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3661.973s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, you're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4298.766s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's good seeing you and I'm running into you everywhere with the signature board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4302.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I'm so happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4305.187s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was kind of brainstorming and I had some ideas and I just, I'm gonna share them, but I was thinking for beautifying some of the schools, maybe planting some perennials, like the plants that are low maintenance will come back every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4319.39s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, basically when you kind of go up to the community school entrance, there's like this cement block and it's like maybe weeds now, but like if we could put some perennials there and maybe dress up some of the greens and just because that's like such an open space and everybody's going in there to access the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4343.286s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and then talk at one point that, you know, doing space, turning it into an outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4359.93s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, peaceful place, you know, for the seniors to go at lunch and, you know, kind of just dressing it up a little bit with some benches and, you know, it would be like senior privilege where they could go out to that open space and, you know, it'd look really pretty when you're walking through to go into the other building and I had that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4377.168s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then the parks, I had the parks right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4379.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was like, oh, the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4380.371s">[Kreatz]</a>: We could take care of the parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6586.737s">[Kreatz]</a>: I can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6588.618s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have training at my work, and then I'm on the advisory committee, so I can't go that week either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=429.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=430.221s">[Kreatz]</a>: We'd like it read, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8051.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to follow up with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8053.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I was in touch with Miss Simonides and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the M.I.A.A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8060.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: regarding the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8062.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: If you've had a chance to file that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8148.902s">[Kreatz]</a>: did you communicate that information to the parent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8164.934s">[Kreatz]</a>: So you got the name and the person is not certified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8169.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13680.833s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13684.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13684.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13686.599s">[Kreatz]</a>: It does mention, I was going to ask about the cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13689.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13693.986s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall where a lot of parents were very concerned because a lot of cameras were out and they weren't operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13703.775s">[Kreatz]</a>: So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15312.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: The wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15992.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15992.31s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15994.411s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had a similar question about the forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15996.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to know, are the forms going to be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents where they can go in and add their information and move it along?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16007.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16428.877s">[Kreatz]</a>: Does the motion that this meeting be adjourned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16431.078s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have one very quick announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16435.098s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just want to make one quick announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16504.922s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm gonna get a message over to Lisa Evangelista to ask her to share the link on the blog if anybody gets a chance to tune in and it's just a great new show that's been created by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16518.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: several students, a combination of high school and vocational students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16523.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to give a couple of mentions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1368.76s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1369.021s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have a report and so I'm the chairperson on the rules subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1376.752s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we met on February 26 in the superintendent's conference room at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1382.076s">[Kreatz]</a>: The purpose of the meeting was to review the revised proposed reporting requirements for PTO, PTG, Friends of organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1390.762s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1390.962s">[Kreatz]</a>: Jenny Graham, who's here tonight, was instrumental in helping the committee create a softer online version of the oversight guidelines for PTO, PTG, and other internal 501c3 organizations, other organizations that support our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1406.862s">[Kreatz]</a>: In your packets, please be advised that this evening, everybody got revised copies of the guidelines and they were left on your desk this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1415.984s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if you could just be mindful of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1418.584s">[Kreatz]</a>: There was a couple of typographical errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1420.965s">[Kreatz]</a>: There was multiple versions of the copies and accidentally, I think, you know, the wrong one got printed in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1427.326s">[Kreatz]</a>: So just, you know, be on the lookout for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1430.566s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna read briefly the objective<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1433.973s">[Kreatz]</a>: The document is rather long, but it's very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1437.834s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1438.534s">[Kreatz]</a>: If anybody has any questions afterwards, I'll be happy to go over any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1442.815s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm going to read the objectives, and then I'm going to invite Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1445.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham up to show everybody a demonstration of the online form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1450.577s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, so the objective of the PTO-PTG guidelines is the school committee recognizes that there are a significant number of organizations that operate within<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1462.813s">[Kreatz]</a>: Medford to augment and supplement the educational and extracurricular experiences of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1468.717s">[Kreatz]</a>: These PTO, PTG, other 501C3 organizations will be referred to as organizations throughout the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1476.781s">[Kreatz]</a>: The committee appreciates the hard work and the dedication of the organization of volunteers and wishes to foster an environment of collaboration and shared vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1486.747s">[Kreatz]</a>: To do that, it's important that the committee understands the number of organizations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1491.422s">[Kreatz]</a>: in the goals of each operating to the benefit of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1495.705s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not the goal of the committee to centralize, stifle the efforts of the independent entities, many of which are 501c3 registered entities, but rather support their efforts through transparency and collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1509.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: And you'll notice that there's a section on organization identification, which includes the online form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1516.617s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's a section on the bylaws,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1520.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: which has some best practice information in it, and it's detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1525.579s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's information about fundraising and expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1529.282s">[Kreatz]</a>: Training is offered and available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1531.944s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not gonna be required, but it will be offered and strongly recommended when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1536.387s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's also going to be an annual update, and there's compliance with the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1544.032s">[Kreatz]</a>: So at this time, I'd like to invite Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1546.373s">[Kreatz]</a>: Jenny Graham up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1547.434s">[Kreatz]</a>: And she's been extremely instrumental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1550.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: And she's just been a great help and amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1553.437s">[Kreatz]</a>: And she's going to demonstrate the online form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1555.539s">[Kreatz]</a>: And you'll get to see how easy and user-friendly it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1559.161s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1578.587s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not going to be this April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1580.828s">[Kreatz]</a>: So what we're doing is tonight, we are reviewing the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1584.15s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's what we're making a decision on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1585.711s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're going to review the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1587.332s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're going to see the online form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1589.348s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I'm going to hopefully make a motion to accept the guidelines, the online form, so that we can roll it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1596.869s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're going to have it put on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1598.37s">[Kreatz]</a>: I already got in touch with Superintendent Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1600.69s">[Kreatz]</a>: So once we approve this, he's going to get in touch with the people who can put it on the website so that we can start collecting the information so that we'll have all the registered groups by October 1, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1613.172s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because they're going to have from now until October to get registered, because this is a new process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1946.237s">[Kreatz]</a>: Very smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2106.656s">[Kreatz]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2109.098s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2109.699s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's really, it's so easy to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2230.507s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2245.429s">[Kreatz]</a>: It just seems like a lot of work for someone else to take on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2247.83s">[Kreatz]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2328.353s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2329.854s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kritz, you wanted to make a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2331.495s">[Kreatz]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2332.356s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's a motion on the floor to accept this policy, seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2337.82s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2338.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2360.387s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3286.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3561.233s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4278.18s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wanted to say, I was at the open house, and it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4281.042s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4282.323s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I loved how it was so personable with the parents and the teachers speaking and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4287.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I actually learned a lot about Mr. Tucci, that he was a baseball player, and he was on the San Diego Padres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4292.79s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was so impressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4294.612s">[Kreatz]</a>: I found that out at the open house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4296.573s">[Kreatz]</a>: And the students did a great, great job taking people around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4300.736s">[Kreatz]</a>: The groups were filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4302.717s">[Kreatz]</a>: Going up to the classrooms, the classrooms were filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4305.657s">[Kreatz]</a>: The teachers did a great job with the setup of the projects that were out, and just going over everything, asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4314.019s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just a really, it was a very fun evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4316.98s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had a really fun time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4318.521s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I wish the McGlynn the best, you know, and all the luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6530.696s">[Kreatz]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6531.977s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6532.197s">[Kreatz]</a>: Krex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6532.978s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6533.458s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6535.179s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just want to know how the transition is going with the vocational students over centralized in the 1C building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6543.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've just heard from some students and parents, the students who are in the vocational school getting over to the guidance council office, it's just a little farther of a distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6555.153s">[Kreatz]</a>: And where some of the students are on co-op,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6558.782s">[Kreatz]</a>: they're only in school like every other week, so I wanted to know if, and I don't know for sure, but if there's afternoon hours for the guidance, so that the students who are in the vocational side, where they have like the one week of academics, they really can't be kind of pulled from their classes to go down to the guidance, but they do want to participate in the scholarship programs, and they're getting ready for colleges and applications, and it does take some time, so I didn't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6587.77s">[Kreatz]</a>: if there was any assistance or aids that help out with that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6641.194s">[Kreatz]</a>: What about getting copies of the printed transcripts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6645.406s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I know if you're going to be filling out a college application or scholarship, you have to get the official transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6651.468s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I was just thinking it might be helpful if somebody else in the office, besides the guidance Councilor or assigned Councilor, could print them out for the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6661.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: But it would be an authorized person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6663.112s">[Kreatz]</a>: Or Secretary Andre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6664.752s">[Kreatz]</a>: Andre?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6699.09s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I just wanted to know, because I was reading in the report and I did get to talk to some of the guidance Councilors at the high school and I think there is actual like more like social emotional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6711.315s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I was thinking in terms of the budget that, you know, do we have enough Councilors at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6718.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I'm just, I was really, you know, thinking that myself and I had it highlighted in the report because, you know, I've heard that there's more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6726.179s">[Kreatz]</a>: social emotional is taking a lot of the time to spend with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6731.621s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that was just my thought in thinking, do we have enough Councilors to assist all of the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=12.06s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. Stone, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=13.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=15.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Russo, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=16.763s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. Van de Koot, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=31.346s">[Kreatz]</a>: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=182.811s">[Kreatz]</a>: Right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=183.932s">[Kreatz]</a>: I knew it was right there in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=489.412s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=489.832s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=490.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: Nice to meet you, Dr. Strait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=491.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=491.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: You too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=492.353s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=493.034s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, as you know, we have 18 approved vocational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=497.215s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=497.555s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=500.396s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=505.279s">[Kreatz]</a>: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=508.341s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=514.285s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I can repeat that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=515.446s">[Kreatz]</a>: Please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=517.167s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=517.787s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the first part is, how would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=526.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=535.109s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=535.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=765.588s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=766.168s">[Kreatz]</a>: That answers the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=767.208s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=770.85s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, we'll go around again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=771.55s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=771.81s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=772.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Trevena.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2024.275s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have kind of part two on my vocational question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2028.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you work with the school administration to continue to promote career and technical education in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2037.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2038.364s">[Kreatz]</a>: There wasn't any other questions to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6878.239s">[Kreatz]</a>: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6883.28s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6886.342s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6890.303s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9023.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just have one follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9025.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you allocate money to support the programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9029.21s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know a lot of the programs, some of them have a higher number of enrollment versus others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9036.356s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what would you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9038.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do you have any experience writing grants to request money to support some of the programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4622.785s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was curious, like, is dyslexia something that is curable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4626.846s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, could somebody with early intervention outgrow dyslexia in their middle school and high school years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=609.905s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=610.706s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we do the roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=611.827s">[Kreatz]</a>: Roll call vote, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=622.338s">[Kreatz]</a>: next up is report of secretaries and I do have a okay so we're going to move on to report of committees so we had a committee of the whole and we just evaluated the superintendent and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=641.353s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=641.933s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=642.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: So we're going to hold off on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=644.715s">[Kreatz]</a>: Next is Special Education Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=647.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: Erin DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=808.158s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=810.881s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=818.853s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, and so I have a report from the Rules Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=823.375s">[Kreatz]</a>: We had two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=824.696s">[Kreatz]</a>: One was on June 13th and the other one was on June 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=828.418s">[Kreatz]</a>: The purpose of our meetings was to update the rules and regulations of the Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=833.26s">[Kreatz]</a>: Everyone has in their packets a copy of the old document<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=837.342s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was either from 2004 or older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=839.963s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're really not sure about the historical date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=842.424s">[Kreatz]</a>: And you have a copy of the updated 2019 document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=846.486s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we went through and we updated chapters 1 through 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=850.467s">[Kreatz]</a>: So we broke it up into two separate meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=852.788s">[Kreatz]</a>: On the June 13th, we discussed chapters 1 to 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=855.789s">[Kreatz]</a>: In June 19, we discussed chapters 7 to 10, and we made a motion to accept the changes that were put ahead in the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=864.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: You'll see throughout the entire document, we removed words such as chairman, replaced it with chairperson, and words<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=871.48s">[Kreatz]</a>: him, his, or her were replaced with gender-free words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=875.544s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also, you will see a new section at the bottom of the documents, and thank you to Mr. Russo for coming up with this great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=884.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: It is the policy information, such as first adopted date, last amended date, last renewed date, renewed frequency, next renewal, and version number, so that we can easily identify what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=899.745s">[Kreatz]</a>: the age of the document and determine like when is it going to need to be updated the next date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=907.114s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I want to just thank all the committee members for coming to the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=910.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: We did spend several hours in the meetings going through the very old language and updating it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=918.208s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, 2019 language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=920.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: Some of it was very old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=922.491s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we also reached out to several different administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=927.655s">[Kreatz]</a>: Diane Caldwell assisted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=930.577s">[Kreatz]</a>: Christine Patterson assisted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=932.138s">[Kreatz]</a>: Let's see, Headmaster DeLever, Principal Fallon, Supervisor of Nurses Toni Wray, and, you know, emailing, just going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=944.587s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you to Dr. Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=946.588s">[Kreatz]</a>: She was a great asset to the meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=949.368s">[Kreatz]</a>: And my colleagues, thank you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=953.009s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you all for your hard work and efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=954.79s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I hope everybody had a chance to review the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=958.011s">[Kreatz]</a>: And Erin, did you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1251.3s">[Kreatz]</a>: So is there a motion to accept the report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1255.161s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1257.221s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Ochoa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1257.822s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1259.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1260.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1263.383s">[Kreatz]</a>: And is there anybody here for community participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1267.844s">[Kreatz]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1268.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1270.524s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so report from superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1786.152s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1787.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was thinking, I heard from Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1790.415s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot, and so I was wondering, I was thinking that in the future, if we knew early enough, could we plan like a civic field trip where maybe one of the teachers could go along with the students and go into town with parent permission<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1807.03s">[Kreatz]</a>: to go into the strike or, you know, the protest with adult supervision and as long as they had their parental permissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1890.578s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know how many students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1893.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: do we know if any students attended the strike that day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1896.962s">[Kreatz]</a>: Another parent had asked me, she said, do you know how many students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1900.383s">[Kreatz]</a>: Or we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1921.693s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know if during the day were there discussions maybe at, you know, at civic class or history class to just talk about the climate strike with the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1933.041s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was just, I also received that question from parents, like did they actually engage in discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2025.396s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had one more, because I know, I think it was last year, where there was a walk-in, where the students didn't actually walk out, but they were allowed to walk into the gymnasium or the cafeteria for about 10 to 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2038.642s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was like a safe walk, where they could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2041.723s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was another idea that we could do if the students still wanted to have a strike, they could do it within the school at a certain time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2050.847s">[Kreatz]</a>: But that was just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2054.069s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3243.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I would be happy to chair the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3255.762s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3256.042s">[Kreatz]</a>: So yes, I did talk with Mayor about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3259.764s">[Kreatz]</a>: And even Mr. Brown, he is interested on serving as a volunteer on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3266.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: And he can bring his expertise to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3269.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: We also want to have some ideas, just brainstorming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3273.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: doing some tours, walking around the school, and just putting together a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3280.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: We know that we're waiting for the MSBA interest statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3283.405s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're hoping to get that, but I think what a lot of people want to do is just have a discussion, start talking about things, and putting together a plan, and then prioritizing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3295.197s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I do know that currently some of the CTE programs are currently reconfiguring to their new spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3302.92s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it would be nice to even, you know, share some of those stories and we can bring it back to the regular committee and just tell everybody what's going on in those, you know, those areas that are reconfiguring and what the status is in progress and maybe something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3319.107s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we could have like a Google document where we could, you know, have a timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3323.969s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3325.302s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, this is where we want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3327.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is when we get the MSBA statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3329.924s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here's the five-year capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3331.305s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's like a lot of planning involved, so it would be a lot of like mini-meetings to just track the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3336.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: But yeah, so that's about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3338.028s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6028.274s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6030.256s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the questions I had, you had already answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6032.518s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was the copy paper and the textbooks and the supplies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6037.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had all the same questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6039.106s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did have one more, and I know we talked about this last year, and I know it's really early on, but I think, Michael, you might have mentioned this, that we wanted to go for an observation day, and maybe sit, I know it's very early on, it's just they're still getting set up and established, but I would really love to go and be invited to the class, and just for the day, without interrupting the instruction, but just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6061.479s">[Kreatz]</a>: participate with the students, if that's something that would be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5805.445s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5806.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5808.087s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have one question, and I think Paulette maybe touched on some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5812.269s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I just wanted to know, so can the LexiaCore be used for the upper grades if somebody's struggling or develops dyslexia in middle school or high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5823.077s">[Kreatz]</a>: And will they get the intervention that they need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5826.099s">[Kreatz]</a>: Just checking on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5826.899s">[Kreatz]</a>: So LexiaCore 5 does go beyond second grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5829.621s">[Kreatz]</a>: So yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5830.461s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5831.322s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I know that a parent, I received a message who mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5834.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: we think that the Dibles 8 did cover the upper grades, Lexia Core will cover those students as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=374.501s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=375.382s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have a question, and I'm familiar with the report and the reimbursement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=382.824s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to explain to the new committee members, and maybe, Christine, if you could explain, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=388.186s">[Kreatz]</a>: Patterson, how a teacher or administrator submits a reimbursement, like what's required in order for them to get reimbursed, and do they get full reimbursement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=946.338s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1527.589s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I have to disclose that my sister works as an assistant group leader in the after school program and I already completed a disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest form and I submitted it with the city clerk's office last Thursday so I could speak this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1546.741s">[Kreatz]</a>: After learning, immediately after the school committee meeting in November, I heard from some students and they had told me that they were still making the minimum wage, which was the $11 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1559.827s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was a little confused because I thought that everybody was making above that, which was between the 12 and then going up to the 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1567.77s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I had sent a message off to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1570.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: assistant superintendent's office, and she was, sorry, assistant superintendent of finance, and she was going to look into, let's see, look into an option and explore a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1584.741s">[Kreatz]</a>: that we can increase it in the budget level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1588.103s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to say that I really appreciate everything that you do in the after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1593.828s">[Kreatz]</a>: I volunteered at the Brooks, the Roberts, and I've been to the McGlynn after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1598.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I've observed and participated and helped out in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1602.674s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's very well structured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1604.135s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1605.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: It starts off with physical education, either inside or outside, then everybody goes back indoors and they're doing either story time in the younger groups, arts and crafts activities, then there's homework time, and then there's some free time, and I've spent the afternoon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1624.415s">[Kreatz]</a>: until it's pickup time with the classrooms that I've been in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1629.1s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just been a wonderful experience for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1631.723s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I've seen and see exactly what you do on the floor and in the schools working with the students and how they look up to you as role models and how they really appreciate everything that you're doing and just that you're a student working with another student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1647.259s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just wonderful seeing everything that you're doing in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1651.526s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you and I am very proud of everything that you do in the program and for coming out here tonight and advocating for the after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1660.419s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4013.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4015.07s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4016.572s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to report out an update about the community fund grant checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4022.797s">[Kreatz]</a>: This morning I received an email from Aleesha Nunley, Finance Director Auditor, and the Chief of Staff in the Mayor's Office, Dave Rodriguez, is working on a communications to update everybody about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4036.035s">[Kreatz]</a>: grant checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4037.836s">[Kreatz]</a>: Under the guidance of the Department of Revenue, they're working on a mechanism to fund the awards from the casino to the individual recipients.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4047.44s">[Kreatz]</a>: Since the casino just opened last summer, this is the first time the city has made awards based on the surrounding community agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4056.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we want to do this in a legal and in transparent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4061.547s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if everybody, we really appreciate your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4065.814s">[Kreatz]</a>: your continued patience and hopefully we'll see an update either on the website or maybe by email sometime this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4074.616s">[Kreatz]</a>: Just wanted to share that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4077.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4236.209s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to say, you know, thank you for bringing this report and thank you for coming out and explaining that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4242.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did, and the superintendent answered already, I did have a question like who was going to be competing and she explained it was like the various different programs, the automotive and the, I forget where my list went, but so that answered my other question and I just want to wish the students good luck and I hope to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4262.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: and hear back from you after the competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4265.665s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4266.105s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4268.327s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4268.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've never been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4463.615s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4464.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4465.696s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know, so the state-of-the-art fire alarm control panel, so does that, like, are the students going to be learning, like, you know, where they can detect where a fire might be or, yeah, that's what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4477.7s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, like, it will, like, identify, like, where, like, the location of the fire and then pin it off to the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4525.219s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep, and that's just, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4527.68s">[Kreatz]</a>: And thank you very much to the Nadon electrical support and for their support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4533.043s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, it is incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4534.904s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just thought it was incredible myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4537.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what does the data rack do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4540.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, is that like a, like I'm not sure what that is either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4609.78s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4610.543s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4611.305s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4617.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, I just I really didn't know and I didn't Google because I thought I would ask and find out from the experts Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4728.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4729.937s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to know now, can this award be used for anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4734.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are there any plans for the award, what they're going to use it for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4738.339s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did look through it, and I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4740.02s">[Kreatz]</a>: It says something in math and science for higher education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4744.581s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wasn't sure if it was going to a certain department, or was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4918.512s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4919.312s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just had a quick question because I know this question comes up a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4923.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is the difference between a long-term substitute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4926.661s">[Kreatz]</a>: a daily sub and a per diem sub.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4929.262s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm just curious, even at my own work where I work at MTRS, it comes up a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4934.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: And each school district has a different definition for what it is in their school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4940.267s">[Kreatz]</a>: Some require DESE certification for long-term subs, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4945.69s">[Kreatz]</a>: The same for per diem and daily subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4948.211s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was just wondering what Medford's definition was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4952.453s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5011.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I just had one question, because some of the locations were listed as male, like for example, like M-A-I-L for the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5021.578s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I was just wondering, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5023.499s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was really just miscellaneous throughout the spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6096.361s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6097.482s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6097.902s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Vicazelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6099.083s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6099.824s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say, you know, I noticed last year the feedback we got was we didn't communicate, you know, timely, early, and I'm happy to see that we're getting this information out, all the dates out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6110.825s">[Kreatz]</a>: so early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6111.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's only beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6113.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6114.686s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6117.647s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6119.188s">[Kreatz]</a>: Two are really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6120.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are the open houses going to have the student-led tours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6123.81s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know they had them last year where the students also participated in the tours along with the teachers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6131.472s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that was something that I think a lot of the students really appreciated seeing and meeting other students that are in the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6190.234s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6192.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then these are kind of fun questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6194.979s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to know, last year we had the middle school barbecue in the summer and it was a great, I thought it was a great success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6202.886s">[Kreatz]</a>: I went, I helped serve, and Peter, he did a lot of burgers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6208.311s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if that was maybe in the plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6210.914s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's early, but if we were planning to do something like that again this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6236.172s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6237.413s">[Kreatz]</a>: And keep us up to date, because I know a lot of us want to help out and volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6255.097s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are you all set, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6256.118s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6257.498s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if the auditing company was going to be doing anything differently to ensure the equitable number of students from each elementary school assigned to the two middle schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6273.708s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've heard that one school didn't have a lot of students in that middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6278.271s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that was still a little bit fuzzy last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6282.313s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was just wondering if there was any plan to do anything a little bit differently to balance it out a little bit better or... So the plan is to do the process similar to what we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1594.593s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1596.414s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I want to say thank you to the committee for putting these instructions together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1600.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did have just a couple of really simple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1604.678s">[Kreatz]</a>: So do we follow these same procedures to add subcommittee meeting minutes to the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1610.401s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I know quite often we have to send a request to add our meeting minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1614.803s">[Kreatz]</a>: Would we follow the same procedure, I'm assuming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1617.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1946.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1947.265s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just had just a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1950.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I just wanted to know, when we send it in the subject, should we put specifically, please add to agenda, you know, something that will stand out that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1960.595s">[Kreatz]</a>: will be unique for people adding to the agenda so that the superintendent and the mayor know that, oh, this is an item for the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1969.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: I should make that a priority over some other emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1972.041s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1973.402s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was just my thought at my work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1974.682s">[Kreatz]</a>: We have certain subject procedures when emailing, but that was just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1979.725s">[Kreatz]</a>: And also, I wanted to know, who is the designee while we wait for a replacement for the executive assistant, which is just recently developed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1990.394s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1991.534s">[Kreatz]</a>: McLaughlin has mentioned this a couple of times with some other procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1995.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are we going to put these procedures on the websites once they're approved so that we can easily access them for reference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2001.757s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, because like, I mean, I think we come across one of the documents which is functions of the school committee and I had the final version, but you know how like there's multiple versions everywhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2011.579s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where is the final one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2012.859s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, so I was just wondering where will this be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2015.5s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2086.424s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess I did want to know, you know, who, like, who should we be, like, just to, you know, to start the process, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2093.51s">[Kreatz]</a>: Going forward, we have to schedule some meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2095.89s">[Kreatz]</a>: So am I going to send it to the mayor, the superintendent, and who else while we wait for a replacement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2101.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is it going to go to Pete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2108.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, so the mayor and superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2110.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor and superintendent, chair and superintendent, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2112.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2112.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2115.454s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it doesn't matter, just put anything in the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2118.474s">[Kreatz]</a>: Agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2119.715s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2121.395s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2437.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: To extend it to three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3379.676s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3380.798s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for your years of service, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3383.161s">[Kreatz]</a>: Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3383.982s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very much appreciated and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3386.947s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5620.47s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I wanted to say thank you Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5622.391s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ray and Dr. Sabe for being here and thank you for the frequently asked questions to the mayor's office and last Friday's bulletin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5630.339s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was excellent and I found it so useful and some of my questions were answered and I really appreciate it and I know there's a lot of people out there that are, you know, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5640.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, concerned, anxious, worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5643.87s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can they get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5644.911s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, it's just there's a lot to think about every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5648.792s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're getting the reports and just it's updating all day long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5652.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's all we hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5654.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it can be a little nerve wracking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5656.094s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I really appreciate everything that everybody's doing to keep us updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5660.276s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also something that we want to think about is the methods of communicating if we have to cancel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5666.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if schools have to dismiss, I did hear of some schools that had to dismiss at the last minute because a parent had come into the school and was tested positive and they had to get in touch with everybody to send the students home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5681.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I don't think we've ever had to do that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5684.193s">[Kreatz]</a>: So there's a lot to think about and consider in the planning stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5688.897s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I appreciate everything that everybody's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5691.559s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's really a tremendous amount of work everybody's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5693.801s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5694.871s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5695.231s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5696.192s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5720.194s">[Kreatz]</a>: last couple of years we've been going back to school three days in August and this year we're not and I was just wondering if that's going to be the start of a new trend if we're gonna you know kind of we're not going to go back in August anymore or did that just happen with the calendar this year I wasn't sure so it's just I just happen to notice so I just thought I would ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5894.554s">[Kreatz]</a>: to all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5895.495s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean especially like 36 seniors and you know it's senior year and it's just so unfortunate with the coronavirus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5903.94s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I understand it's very disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5907.641s">[Kreatz]</a>: And at the same time, I'm torn because I just want to make sure that the students, their safety and well-being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5914.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's a really tough situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5917.444s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I really feel for you and all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5920.705s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I hope that there's something that maybe another way or an event that we can do here to celebrate maybe not going to France, but just doing a nice cultural event here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5933.413s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean, it wouldn't really make it better, but just something that we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5939.014s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to express how this is very sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5942.635s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I did hear from some parents, it's very disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5945.836s">[Kreatz]</a>: But they understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5947.316s">[Kreatz]</a>: And they understand that it's a risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5949.896s">[Kreatz]</a>: And they don't want to kind of put their student, their child in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5953.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's a really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5955.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm sorry that we have to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5961.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=646.624s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=676.203s">[Kreatz]</a>: The parent is just concerned that it's going to be counted as a not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=682.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just want to get that on the record that it's not a requirement and if they don't want to go on the Zoom call, it's not going to hurt their grade for pass or fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=694.255s">[Kreatz]</a>: So could somebody please clarify that for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=696.636s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=724.498s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=725.182s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=726.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and I just wanted to share, um, or, you know, my concern regarding, and I know you don't have the numbers just yet, but, um, in terms of how many families haven't been connected with, and, um, last week I had a conversation with, uh, Dr. Cushing, um, and I shared an idea that I had, um, that maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=748.772s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we're still having trouble reaching out to these families, we could have the school resource officer, or maybe the police department, do a wellness check with these families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=759.978s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because you know, how do we know they even have any of the communication that we're giving to everybody I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=766.181s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, I'm a little concerned and worried for those families because if we haven't heard from them, we don't know what they know and what they don't know regarding the distance learning and what we're doing regarding the pass or fail or just any of the communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=779.649s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, you know, I just wanted to just share my idea and, you know, just put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=784.672s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1205.911s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to say a couple of words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.633s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.874s">[Kreatz]</a>: Patterson, I want to say thank you very much for your service over the last couple of years in such a short amount of time you have accomplished so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1218.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: You were a great help to me when I was signing the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1221.98s">[Kreatz]</a>: In fact, you came down and met me at city hall and showed me what to do and answered any questions I had about the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1230.805s">[Kreatz]</a>: You've just done an incredible job balancing the budget and beginning the process to change the scheduling of the budget, which we started last year, which was extremely efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1244.769s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we were able to have the meetings more regularly to discuss them in smaller group sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1250.47s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just really appreciate everything you've done and I wish you well in your new endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1254.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5601.768s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, sorry, I couldn't get to it, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6320.984s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6321.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm also going to summarize my meeting minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6324.706s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I've condensed them to just about two pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6328.048s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll be brief, as can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6329.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: We had a building and grounds meeting on March 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6333.411s">[Kreatz]</a>: One of the topics we discussed was the high school generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6336.013s">[Kreatz]</a>: I shared the specs with everybody via email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6339.055s">[Kreatz]</a>: We received the specs from Gone Green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6341.256s">[Kreatz]</a>: The total estimate is 186,925.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6345.586s">[Kreatz]</a>: John McLaughlin informed the committee, it's very important to replace the generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6349.508s">[Kreatz]</a>: There were two generators at Medford High School, one in the front and one in the back of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6353.451s">[Kreatz]</a>: The one on the vocational side is the one that failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6357.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we had a power event in the winter, we could have problems with the pipes freezing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6361.856s">[Kreatz]</a>: We got an update from John McLaughlin after the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6364.497s">[Kreatz]</a>: He shared an email with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6365.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: He spoke to the contractor about the life expectancy of the spec that we got for the new generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6372.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's going to be 20 years with proper maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6375.544s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Murphy informed us he met with procurement officials last week regarding the need to go through bidding process for the repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6381.469s">[Kreatz]</a>: The generator is a capital expense and not an operating cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6384.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6385.812s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot expressed, while we have to struggle with priorities, we don't want to be in a situation where the pipes could burst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6391.376s">[Kreatz]</a>: We want to avoid the huge emergency costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6394.478s">[Kreatz]</a>: There was a vote taken on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6396.1s">[Kreatz]</a>: I motioned to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming Committee of the Whole meeting on March 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6404.226s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was seconded by Paulette Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6406.308s">[Kreatz]</a>: All in favor in the motion passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6409.691s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor, I just wanted to know, do we need to take that motion on the floor this evening or will that be okay for the Committee of the Whole meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6420.879s">[Kreatz]</a>: You can take the vote on the floor, just to confirm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6425.862s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I motion to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming committee of the whole meeting on March 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6434.226s">[Kreatz]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6466.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6467.633s">[Kreatz]</a>: After we revisited the discussion about the high school entrance there with three separate projects we talked about ramp at the front of the high school sign in beautification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6477.081s">[Kreatz]</a>: We had a well thought discussion about the high school ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6479.904s">[Kreatz]</a>: Everyone in attendance shared feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6481.866s">[Kreatz]</a>: The project is a capital project and it will require structural engineer to do the drawings to get an idea of the scope of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6488.832s">[Kreatz]</a>: to make the ramp ADA compliant is very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6492.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Cles Andreessen, who is an architect and parent, let us know legally we either leave it as is or do the whole project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6500.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Murphy stated it would be best if we brought forth a suite of recommendations, including the front entrance, the generator, and more to the committee to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6509.89s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also, this may need authorization from the city on some improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6514.033s">[Kreatz]</a>: Next, we discussed a sign for the Merritt High School entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6517.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: Last year, Chris Donovan, parent, shared an idea of a picture idea we had for a sign of the 50th birthday celebration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6525.583s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mentioned it would be a great idea if the vocational students could assist with the sign in either one of the shops, metal fabrication or robotic shop, with their laser plasma cutter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6537.014s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Cushing shared another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6539.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: With Groton-Dunstable, they have a mesh banner that would be cost-effective for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6544.96s">[Kreatz]</a>: It would beautify the building in the short term and allow us to continue with the improvement of the front entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6550.303s">[Kreatz]</a>: Dr. Edouard-Maurice remarked, with so much concrete, there are opportunities to add enhancements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6556.388s">[Kreatz]</a>: She pointed out it's difficult to know where the front of the school is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6559.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: Whatever the wording could be, we could work with the vocational students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6563.914s">[Kreatz]</a>: The picture that was shared does show a true front entrance and official main entrance, even if it would be the short time, a new sign landscaping would be the superintendent's recommended priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6576.187s">[Kreatz]</a>: Dr. Edward Maurice did a check-in with Mr. Fallon while we were in the meeting, and the vocational student shops do have a machine that would make the sign doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6587.811s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Fallon will figure out a cost and give us an estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6591.332s">[Kreatz]</a>: There was another vote taken on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6593.433s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Van der Kloot motioned to contact Mr. Fallon to get a price on these improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6599.715s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also, she would like to get the cost estimate of the banner for the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6604.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: exploring the front entranceway banner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6607.517s">[Kreatz]</a>: On the side building, it's behind the theater where that concrete section expands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6614.599s">[Kreatz]</a>: At this time, I am making that motion on the floor this evening so that we can put those estimates forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6626.121s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can you please restate the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6627.842s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6628.563s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6628.943s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6630.604s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6630.864s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot motioned to contact principal Chad Fallon to get a price estimate on the improvements for the lettering on the front of the front entrance of the school and also to get a cost estimate on the banner for the front of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6646.635s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we're thinking, you know, the banner, if we could get an estimate on the banner for the cement and a banner for the front entrance, just so that we can do a cost comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6778.035s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6778.936s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, some point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6780.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I don't know if I read it clearly, but so the first part of the motion was to contact Principal Fallon to ask if he could get an estimate on the lettering that was in the picture that I shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6798.728s">[Kreatz]</a>: It wouldn't be like, we haven't decided on the lettering and what's gonna go on the lettering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6804.011s">[Kreatz]</a>: whether it be Medford High School or Mustang Pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6808.254s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was just an idea that was shared with me because I'm the chairperson of the Building and Ground Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6815.979s">[Kreatz]</a>: That particular picture had lettering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6818.58s">[Kreatz]</a>: It looked like it was made out of sheet metal and the equipment that the two shops that I had mentioned, which was the robotics and automation and the metal fabrication shops,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6831.689s">[Kreatz]</a>: They do have a laser and a plasma cutter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6834.892s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so those two machines, I believe, it might be possible for the vocational shops and or teachers and students possibly to create that lettering sign which would go on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6852.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: front of the front entrance high school where you go up on the ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6857.137s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then the idea that Mr. Cushing was sharing with us had to do with the large concrete section that is behind the Caron Theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6868.245s">[Kreatz]</a>: So all that concrete to brighten up that area<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6874.509s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Cushing shared an idea of having a banner that might look nice, you know, to cover up the concrete and it might have, you know, we just talked about ideas like having Mustangs running or maybe Mustang Pride could go there with some Mustangs and then the lettering would be on the front of the school with maybe Medford High School so that there's a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6897.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: front entrance and um I did I did ask about this um the lettering you know would be I believe would be able to take him down if we were to you know have either the vocational students do it or an outside company and that lettering could be then put on you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6916.753s">[Kreatz]</a>: a renovation in another area, if at some time, maybe five to 10 years from now, there is a full renovation, but the structure of the building itself is sound, so they might keep the original structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6933.086s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do think that the estimates are for getting prices on those so that at our next meeting, we can talk about the next part of the plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10599.594s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, did you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10600.735s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10602.216s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you to all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10603.657s">[Kreatz]</a>: All the poems were beautifully written and inspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10606.66s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're all talented poets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10608.361s">[Kreatz]</a>: Incredible job to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10610.002s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13245.464s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry, my dog was barking, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15552.728s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I was just trying to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15554.789s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so, you know, I would like to ask my colleagues, you know, if they would consider, respectfully consider, you know, in advance of the meeting, reviewing the timeline that has been put forth in both resolutions and consider expanding the dates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15576.135s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean, I just went back and I read the original resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15580.241s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the, the, the original resolution states, be it resolved that the Christopher Columbus elementary school be renamed effective July one 2021 in advisory committee shall be created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15594.179s">[Kreatz]</a>: with a term of six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15596.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the advisory committee was supposed to have six months beginning no later than October 1st and provide a recommendation to the committee no later than February 1st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15609.748s">[Kreatz]</a>: So in that original resolution, it was given ample time to come up with a new name, have that committee formed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15621.354s">[Kreatz]</a>: have a new name discussed, thoroughly vetted, and that the school committee would reconvene the Committee of the Whole before September 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15630.811s">[Kreatz]</a>: Now, I'm just pointing out the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15634.049s">[Kreatz]</a>: all of those dates have already been passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15637.43s">[Kreatz]</a>: We missed all those deadline dates and we missed all those deadline dates because we're in a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15644.012s">[Kreatz]</a>: And as we've seen in the pandemic, all the dates had to slide for everything we were doing, everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15651.653s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just all the dates had to slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15654.734s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I am just respectfully asking if my colleagues could think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15662.196s">[Kreatz]</a>: In preparation of Wednesday's meeting, you know if we can maybe try to come up with a different timeline, so that there can be a thoughtful respective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15673.489s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry not respective reflective discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15677.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: for that advisory committee once they're formed to thoroughly research a new name, have public meetings, listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15689.943s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I feel like we're rushing this to make that deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15695.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: and we're still in a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15698.646s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just feel that it's such an enormous, you know, task and it just, it requires time, thoughtful time consideration in hearing from all community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15921.631s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just had one more, because I've been hearing, you know, over the last couple of days, and I did not read it in the original resolution, but I've been hearing that if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15935.569s">[Kreatz]</a>: The deadline wasn't met by July 1 2021 that the Columbus school would would then be renamed the no name school, but I'm not seeing that in the original resolution so I'm just, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, is that something that I'm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15956.417s">[Kreatz]</a>: missing or overlooking if um one of the committee members who wrote that resolution if you could let us know because I have been hearing a lot about that and I just want to you know kind of get an answer on that because I don't know and I didn't know anything about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15985.925s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so that just might have been something that got kind of overheard somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15989.766s">[Kreatz]</a>: Somewhere, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15990.986s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, all right, I just wanted to confirm that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=258.037s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=259.718s">[Kreatz]</a>: Stone for sharing that history with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=261.978s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I concur with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.119s">[Kreatz]</a>: Vanderkoot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.879s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I'm not ready to make a decision, and I do feel that this process should be a public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=273.402s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, from many of the community members that I've heard, you know, since June of 2020,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=280.342s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, we, we've been waiting for this meeting, so that we could have the public engage and, you know, ask questions and share their opinions, but I do think that that name is, you know, would be is a good suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=296.992s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, once we come up with the plans for choosing the names process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=302.015s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, so I just wanted to share that information and I just want to ask the mayor a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=306.598s">[Kreatz]</a>: So mayor, I just had a question because I had a motion, you know, in regards to the two resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=313.763s">[Kreatz]</a>: Should I hold off and wait till we get to that part of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=345.498s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have a motion that is in regards to the entire timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=351.645s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm wondering if I should just read that now and if it could be considered, you know, as a, you know, in a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=364.208s">[Kreatz]</a>: It should probably take me about two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=367.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, in my opinion, the deadlines in the meeting dates that were outlined in both resolutions are too tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=375.244s">[Kreatz]</a>: The original resolution on June 15 stated specific dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=379.69s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know July 121 was when the school was going to be renamed, and then there was supposed to be a committee of the whole on September 1, and that's where we are right now we're, we're at the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=392.859s">[Kreatz]</a>: And after that, October 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=397.142s">[Kreatz]</a>: the advisory committee was supposed to be formed, and then they would have been meeting October, November, December, January, and they would have submitted a new name to us by January 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=410.907s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because we're in the global pandemic, three of the four deadlines were missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=416.089s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I think we should take a step back today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=418.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: Today marks one year into the coronavirus pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=423.032s">[Kreatz]</a>: And the Commissioner of Education has stated that the schools must be open for full-time in-person learning on April 5, while middle school will be required to do so on April 28.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=434.207s">[Kreatz]</a>: Our paramount focus should be planning to get the children, teachers, and staff back to school safely to receive the best education, having a budget to accommodate those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=444.234s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think that this should be our priority right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=447.996s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also, due to the magnitude of the change, I have recommended a slightly different timeline because in the original resolution, it was stated that the advisory committee should have a term of six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=464.307s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if I go back to the original timeline, the dates were September 1st, October 1st, November, December, January, February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=474.636s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that was the six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=476.698s">[Kreatz]</a>: So here we are today on April, I'm sorry, not April, March 10th, and we are meeting for the rescheduled September 1st meeting, which was the committee of the whole to plan the structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=489.52s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we're still in the global pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=491.782s">[Kreatz]</a>: So then the next meeting, which would be the advisory committee would have been formed would be in April this coming April, which was, you know, according to the original resolution was exactly one month after the committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=507.659s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that would bring us to April 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=510.001s">[Kreatz]</a>: But I happen to think that April 10th is a little too soon to form the advisory committee, so I was thinking like April 30th would be a good time to form the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=521.644s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then that would give the advisory committee April, then May, June, July and August are summer months, so we have to exclude those months, September,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=532.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: October happens to be Italian American Heritage Month, and we celebrate, you know, Columbus Day, which is a federal holiday, so I'm not sure if we want to include that month for the research or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=546.457s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then that would put our timeline up to November 2021, where the advisory committee would have the full six months, not including the summer months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=556.966s">[Kreatz]</a>: It could be shorter if the committee wanted to meet during the summer months of July and August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=562.871s">[Kreatz]</a>: It all depends on whether or not they would meet, which would mean the advisory committee would be coming to us either if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=570.797s">[Kreatz]</a>: include the summer months they would be coming to us September to bring the new research name or November to bring the new research name and this would give ample time and you know for the advisory committee to have a thoughtful reflective discussions to thoroughly research a new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=590.824s">[Kreatz]</a>: So this is the motion that I'm making to extend the timeline that was detailed in the in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=598.789s">[Kreatz]</a>: The plan that we're working on right now is still working off of the dates that were in the original resolution, but the three dates have already been missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=611.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's my resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=613.992s">[Kreatz]</a>: My motion is to extend the timeline detailed in forming the advisory committee and pushing out the dates a little further so that the advisory committee can have six months as detailed in the original resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1165.603s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor, I just wanted to... Mayor, I just heard from iPhone X, and I guess he was trying to unmute, but he couldn't unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1175.046s">[Kreatz]</a>: Would you be able to try him again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3170.874s">[Kreatz]</a>: member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3171.995s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.036s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.956s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wanted to amend that date because I know that the superintendent we are meeting tonight and the superintendent does her weekly updates every Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3185.184s">[Kreatz]</a>: So and she's meeting this week in particular, um, with Jesse, you know, to gather the information, um, you know, and provide updates to the community on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3195.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, what's going to be, you know, details for reopening schools and getting the children back into school safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3204.278s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I feel as though two days from now is a little too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3208.922s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wanted to amend that date to at the earliest if possible, like Monday or the following Friday, so that that's my amendment, either Monday the 15th, I believe, or Friday the 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6429.054s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can we just go back up a little bit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6430.755s">[Kreatz]</a>: I can't see some of the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6438.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, if you could maybe just try to increase it up to 125 maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6443.49s">[Kreatz]</a>: Perfect, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6448.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just taking a few more moments to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6450.327s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry, I'll be right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6452.031s">[Kreatz]</a>: Take your time, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6521.125s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6524.907s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor, I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6526.688s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6527.928s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I know I'm looking at Paulette's, you know, her, her resolution, and she does have the application form and suggestion will be posted and communicated out to usual mechanisms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6542.805s">[Kreatz]</a>: including translations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.106s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, that's number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just reading the wrong paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6546.828s">[Kreatz]</a>: The application will clearly state that interpretation services will be available to any community member who so requests and technology, laptop, camera, microphone will also be provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6559.758s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6562.139s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so there, okay, there it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6563.781s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7718.249s">[Kreatz]</a>: respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7718.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7720.67s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I completely agree with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7724.491s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot and I strongly believe that all the names must go to the advisory committee and that committee will thoroughly research those names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7738.416s">[Kreatz]</a>: They're going to have to Google, maybe go to the library, break up into groups,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7745.399s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's what I believe the committee is being formed to do, to research all the names, to come up with the best name for our community, and it should be the community which is formed via the committee that's researching these names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7764.46s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I motioned to accept the resolution the way it was put forth by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7771.242s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot, where the advisory committee will be formed and will receive all the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7776.944s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, maybe we could get a copy of the names so that we can also just review them and be familiar with the names that were submitted as suggested names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7786.307s">[Kreatz]</a>: But the process of researching and thoroughly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7791.969s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, reflecting on these names and taking into consideration, you know, everything that's going on in our community, um, just from what we heard this evening, it's, it's very, very important that the community, which is comprised of the advisory committee is part of the process and doing the selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7813.345s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, the entire, if we get 300 names, I believe, yes, they should get all of those names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7879.244s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I did motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7880.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: I didn't hear a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7882.725s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was a second by member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7885.466s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7886.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7886.467s">[Kreatz]</a>: I didn't hear it either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7887.567s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7922.001s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, I'm just hold on one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13474.979s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, can you hear me because it is work I can hear it on my test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13479.915s">[Kreatz]</a>: We can hear you now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13480.876s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13482.837s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13484.118s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I had, when Paulette had shared her resolution, I reached out to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13490.002s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot to just let her know that I felt the same way, that I don't think it should be exclusive to the CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13496.767s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it should be open to high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13500.229s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I felt the same way, and possibly maybe a backup student, whereas we do have two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13509.535s">[Kreatz]</a>: high school students that serve on our committee and they take turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13515.101s">[Kreatz]</a>: So what if, because where it is high school and it's the end of the year and there's finals and things like that, it might be busy with the schedules that they might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13526.893s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I feel like it might, even if we picked two students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13531.957s">[Kreatz]</a>: they might not be able to make all the meetings, but they might, you know, one of them might be able to make a meeting and they could, you know, kind of like go back and forth or come up with a schedule that works for both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13797.054s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13799.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13800.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I, I actually think that, you know, we should really amend this to be more of like number two specifically, and we're at the end, you know, having a lottery selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13814.577s">[Kreatz]</a>: I feel that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13817.719s">[Kreatz]</a>: we shouldn't be involved in selecting the applicants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13822.2s">[Kreatz]</a>: It should those applicants in that section there with the other section at the end should be done via the lottery system where when the applications are sent in there would be a box where somebody could check off<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13839.286s">[Kreatz]</a>: the Racial Equity Task Force, South Medford Community, Medford Historian or Historical Society, CPAC, Italian Alliance, Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13851.6s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13854.005s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, the lottery is the most equitable process where it's not going to be a human, you know, looking at that application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13864.97s">[Kreatz]</a>: There could be room for bias making those selections, you know, to that advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13871.012s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just, I felt as though there needs to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13875.134s">[Kreatz]</a>: a larger number for the lottery selection and in order to do that we would you know have to remove the school committee making a selection for the applicants similar to what we do for the middle school lottery selection where um where the students are put into a lottery and it's it's selected you know via the lottery selection process i think that's worth um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14505.799s">[Kreatz]</a>: I would just like to make a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14508.301s">[Kreatz]</a>: There is still potential room for some bias in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14514.925s">[Kreatz]</a>: In order to make it equitable, I feel as though removing the school committee from the process is the most equitable way to ensure it's a diverse committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14526.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if it's not going to be done via the lottery, there has to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14531.576s">[Kreatz]</a>: Somebody that's overseeing or ensuring that it's a diverse committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14536.44s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll just give an example um, we just recently in september disbanded the vision committee because it wasn't a diverse committee, so That's something that could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14549.272s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're all going to be going through these applications and We have all the same applications and you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14558.712s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, there's room for human error, making that selection, you know, there's room for emotion, making that selection, you know, choosing that candidate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14571.581s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just think, you know, it should be, if it's not gonna be done via the lottery, then I agree with the mayor, it would be part of the administration team, you know, to review the applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14915.02s">[Kreatz]</a>: I would be okay with that resolution, what's proposed by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14919.022s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just really think that there is too much room for bias in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14925.926s">[Kreatz]</a>: It would be okay if we went through and we gave our top 10 and then the final decision would come from the administration so that, you know, I didn't handpick, you know, X, Y, Z, you know, to fit my, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14940.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, what I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14941.855s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just, you know, I just really, and I want to have a diverse committee because we recently just disbanded the visionary committee and we haven't begun that process to start the application process for that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14955.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just feel it's really important that we get a diverse group of candidates, equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17987.947s">[Kreatz]</a>: Well, I wanted to get some clarification, because I thought Mr. Russo said that we couldn't do a lottery as per our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17995.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was going to ask, I thought we couldn't do a lottery, but then I'm seeing the lottery is still in the application process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18004.919s">[Kreatz]</a>: Well, we can take it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18047.757s">[Kreatz]</a>: I agree to the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18049.859s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think that maybe one member, one, the school committee would select one applicant each and then the additional applicants would then go into the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18063.771s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that might be maybe a total of six lottery and each school committee member picking an applicant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18105.146s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it's going to be closer to 20 because we are giving them such a big task to do all the research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18117.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: And based on the current timeline, I've already put my resolution out there for extending the timeline so that they can do the thoughtful discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18130.911s">[Kreatz]</a>: The way that it's detailed now in such a short amount of time, I think that there would need to be additional members to do the additional research with, you know, to thoroughly, you know, pick those names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19724.315s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor Kathy Kreatz is trying to remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19728.738s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19730.119s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I do like the idea of having even a survey for the community so that they can give us some feedback once we have the three final names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19745.035s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it's really important that we involve the community somehow in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19752.08s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19753.341s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think I like the idea of the students at the same time, I just wanna make sure that we're involving the entire community, you know, and including the students in the community in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19765.529s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just something that it's just such a, you know, big responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19771.873s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just getting exhausted, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20595.534s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I'm just really uncomfortable and I wouldn't be able to approve the date, the May 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20610.481s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just feel that it's too rushed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20613.148s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I mentioned that at the beginning of the meeting when I, you know, detailed the timeline, this advisory committee in the resolution that was originally stated was supposed to have a term of six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20629.297s">[Kreatz]</a>: So now we're condensing the six months into about eight weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20634.12s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I'm just, I mean, I would ask my committee members if they would consider changing that date<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20662.398s">[Kreatz]</a>: I still think it's too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20665.689s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I mean, I read the original resolutions that were presented in June, and it clearly stated the advisory committee will have a six-month term so that, you know, in my opinion, that would be ample time for the committee to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20688.871s">[Kreatz]</a>: to have thoughtful, reflective discussions, get the survey results, read the survey results, thoroughly research for the new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20700.444s">[Kreatz]</a>: this is, you know, we're rushing to get the new name on May 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20704.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, we're not, in this particular meeting, we're not changing the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20711.506s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20713.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just, you know, I just think it's too short of a timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20717.928s">[Kreatz]</a>: That that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20788.015s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20791.329s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not in favor of a temporary name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20794.11s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're forming this advisory committee so that they can come up with a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20797.432s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just don't understand some of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20803.174s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's not in the resolution that I went back to the original resolution and it didn't state that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20812.287s">[Kreatz]</a>: The name would have to take on a temporary name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20816.67s">[Kreatz]</a>: If a name wasn't decided by July 1 in keeping in mind that this is a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20825.786s">[Kreatz]</a>: And all the deadlines that occurred all year everywhere, everything changed and got slid and extended and delayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20837.111s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm just, you know, I wouldn't be happy with the way that the resolution in this section is written with the strict timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20847.636s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21254.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: I agree with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21255.933s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21256.453s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've already stated that I think the timeline, you know, the date, all the other dates were missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21264.176s">[Kreatz]</a>: And they were missed because we're in a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21267.277s">[Kreatz]</a>: In the original resolution, it does say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21271.383s">[Kreatz]</a>: that the advisory committee will have six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21275.344s">[Kreatz]</a>: So this time here, May 24th, that's not six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21279.845s">[Kreatz]</a>: So we're gonna keep to the July 1st deadline, but we're gonna just remove the six months that was originally in the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21290.368s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I know that was in the resolution and so was the July 1st date, but we're gonna skip the six months and we're just gonna keep the July 1st<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21300.291s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just not, I mean, it's just not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21302.912s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not fair, it's not equitable, it's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21305.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's how I feel like a strong no for me on May 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21312.777s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's my strong no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21314.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I've already provided my timeline and that wasn't second, so that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21320.621s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm moving on from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21322.322s">[Kreatz]</a>: But I really think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21327.401s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, having this decision on July 1 is rushed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21334.287s">[Kreatz]</a>: I even suggested in the timeline that I put forth at the beginning of the meeting that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21341.494s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we don't count the summer dates, and if the advisory committee were to meet in summer, brings us to September 1st, they would be coming to us with a recommended new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21354.843s">[Kreatz]</a>: Even if they have a couple, like have one meeting in July, one meeting in August, but they still have April, May, June, July, August, and they could come to us with a new name in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21368.069s">[Kreatz]</a>: The way that I read the resolution, it didn't make sense to me that the name had to, you know, transition over immediately on July 1st, where we didn't even follow all the other dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21380.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: We didn't, we missed all those other dates and that didn't matter to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21384.678s">[Kreatz]</a>: It didn't matter that we missed all those dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21387.639s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2356.093s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2357.314s">[Kreatz]</a>: So my question might be similar to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2359.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham's question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2359.876s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had a very, I mean, I think it might be the same exact question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2364.96s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2366.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: How will the costs associated with some of the repairs that we discussed in the building and ground subcommittee last Wednesday, you know, we talked about the generator at the high school, the hot water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2380.473s">[Kreatz]</a>: I see the transformer is listed in this budget and the Curtis Tufts hot water system or boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2391.467s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think you mentioned at the beginning, I was just trying to type everything down really fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2395.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: How will those costs be paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2465.802s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2466.423s">[Kreatz]</a>: And when do you think we'll get the appropriation from the municipal government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2471.266s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess in the past,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2473.416s">[Kreatz]</a>: And maybe I'm wrong, but I think in the past, we typically had the appropriation, like when we went into the final budget meeting, like we knew what we got for a number, but I could be just not remembering it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2521.468s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2658.752s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2659.232s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I said one follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2660.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: So do you think it would be two weeks, three weeks, like where, you know, I'm just curious, like, I mean, you know, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2668.656s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I guess we'll just be waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2740.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9.086s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2894.373s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2894.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2895.853s">[Kreatz]</a>: We had a Building and Grounds Subcommittee on May 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2898.654s">[Kreatz]</a>: All the documents I shared with everybody with the Building and Grounds Subcommittee folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2902.996s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm gonna just summarize the meeting minutes very briefly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2906.417s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then at the end, I'm gonna read all the motions at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2910.478s">[Kreatz]</a>: So we can take one roll call, there were five motions at the meeting, and I'm going to include the minutes of the meeting when I do the motion so that I don't forget because I forgot the last time, unless anybody wants to sever one of the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2923.067s">[Kreatz]</a>: So here's the summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2924.128s">[Kreatz]</a>: First we heard from Mr. Chad Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2954.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's difficult to know where the front entrance is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2956.53s">[Kreatz]</a>: We need an official sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2958.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: We did two polls at the meeting and we narrowed it down to a total of the top three signs, number six, seven, and two that were in the presentation for the poll slideshow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12733.194s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to say I've been watching some of the meetings on YouTube, and they are working really hard on trying to get the slideshow ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12741.579s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just think we need to give them the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12745.401s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean, there's many slides that they were going through one by one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12750.338s">[Kreatz]</a>: and they were making decisions on the slides and making the amendments similar to the process that we went through when we had to come up with the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12757.703s">[Kreatz]</a>: I really would appreciate that we can give them the time that they're spending to put this presentation together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12766.168s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't wanna just cut them off in the middle of the work that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12769.83s">[Kreatz]</a>: They're taking it very seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12785.619s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we could, please give them the additional time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12788.0s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do think that they're going to be ready if they pick the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12792.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't wanna just jump the gun and cut them off in the middle of all the work they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12985.876s">[Kreatz]</a>: we're going to take the vote the same night, or are we going to add another meeting on, because I know that we do have to do one more meeting for the final budget, you know, to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12998.505s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess I'm looking for some clarification on- That's what we're debating right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4490.907s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do have a question or just something I wanted to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4493.908s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was, over the weekend, somebody shared with me that one of the names is Mr. Duck, and I guess there's a proposed bill that is, you know, coming out where the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4509.894s">[Kreatz]</a>: is going to promulgate regulations to ensure that no public school uses athletic name, logo, or mascot, which names refer to or associated with Native Americans, including Native American cultures and specific Native American tribes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4528.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not sure where this bill is right now, but I just wanted to mention it where if this is gonna be coming a regulation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4539.315s">[Kreatz]</a>: that you know possibly in the near future if we were to choose a name like that we might have to have another renaming committee in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4549.238s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4551.538s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11867.15s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11868.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to thank everybody who came out tonight and spoke at the podium or on Zoom and the emails that were sent in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11876.333s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I, you know, first off, all of the choices were excellent and deserving of being the name on a school building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11883.926s">[Kreatz]</a>: I am in favor of Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11887.75s">[Kreatz]</a>: She served as an educator over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11890.712s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm one of eight myself, and I had the privilege to have her as one of my teachers at the Waite School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11896.517s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was a neighborhood school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11897.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: She was a genuine, dedicated teacher, truly outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11901.361s">[Kreatz]</a>: My siblings and friends, we would go by to visit her after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11905.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: She lived in the neighborhood, and we always wanted to go see Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11908.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: Barry, and she's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11909.206s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, be planting outside or taking care of our grass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11912.068s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we'd always say, hi, Miss Barry, and, you know, wave along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11916.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: She would stay after school and help with anything that we were struggling with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11920.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had difficulty with reading and she would stay after with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11923.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, when she did pass away, I'm part of the Waite School Facebook group, and so many stories were shared about her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11933.144s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, you know, everything that was said tonight is all factual, historical,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11939.5s">[Kreatz]</a>: I still remember going to the Wade School, walking with the neighborhood friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11944.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: We just all walked together down the Wade School path to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11949.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, the Medford School is in a better place because of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11951.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11952.486s">[Kreatz]</a>: We have a unique opportunity to honor an educator and pay respect, especially to a person who walked and led in the school that we're renaming right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11965.046s">[Kreatz]</a>: She was a great leader, honoring Jean would also honor all the educators that rose to the many challenges of the unknown during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11973.513s">[Kreatz]</a>: And there's no one more deserving of renaming the school after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11977.817s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's my thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11979.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11982.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11982.781s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I don't want to clap either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11984.222s">[Kreatz]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11985.523s">[Kreatz]</a>: So please, no claps or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11987.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11988.225s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12682.388s">[Kreatz]</a>: Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12768.045s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13813.622s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I've had the light on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13815.204s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have questions about each of the policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13819.648s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I'm going to start with the calendar policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13824.573s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did watch the meeting on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13827.516s">[Kreatz]</a>: I watched it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13829.841s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, I tried to follow it the best I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13832.882s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just have concerns about adding three additional no school days to the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13840.184s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, last week we had, you know, the high heat temperature days and I was getting messages from parents saying that I'm not sending my child to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13850.588s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's too hot to be in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13852.869s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, this is going to be, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13856.75s">[Kreatz]</a>: happening if we're going to having the kids go to school to June 28 June 30th it they're going to be going in the hot hot temperatures adding three more no school days onto the calendar and with all the snow days I mean we don't know in New England it's unpredictable with what the snow days are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13876.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do recall one year that my son went to school until June 29th because there were so many snow days and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13884.18s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was really difficult for the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13886.522s">[Kreatz]</a>: And in fact, the students were done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13889.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: They didn't wanna go and some families just went off on their vacations and didn't finish the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13897.428s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like to have an opportunity to see what other school districts in the greater Boston area are doing or in our neighboring area to know what the implication is of adding the three additional no school days to the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13910.115s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like that information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13912.157s">[Kreatz]</a>: before I was going to make a vote on adding those calendar days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13917.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's what, you know, that's what I have for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13920.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't know if you want me to go on with the public comment and then I have for the agenda, I have some questions or thoughts for the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13927.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do you have an answer to that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13929.354s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14115.913s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll think about that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14117.794s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then in regards to the public comment, so- Mayor, excuse me, could we just discuss one policy at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15330.994s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes I have my light on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15333.236s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep so I am you know I was just I guess I'm just having trouble like I feel like the public comment part and the agenda kind of go together and you know I'm just and I I tried watching the meeting I'm just I'm just a little bit confused because if I look at our current agenda we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15356.855s">[Kreatz]</a>: On our current agenda, currently what we have in this part of the policy, we have community participation, where it does say any citizen may be given permission to speak at the school committee meetings on any agenda item up to three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15372.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's always been on our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15375.684s">[Kreatz]</a>: Then we have the public participation emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15379.405s">[Kreatz]</a>: So is this new policy public comment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15386.008s">[Kreatz]</a>: is that replacing community participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15391.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: You just changed the name of the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15392.93s">[Kreatz]</a>: Instead of saying community participation, it's now gonna be called public comment, but it's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15401.472s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's where I'm just unsure about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15535.893s">[Kreatz]</a>: It does, like it sounds like you're separating it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15538.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I guess I just want some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15542.416s">[Kreatz]</a>: So can a resident,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15545.711s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, come, you know, before the podium at any point and just speak about something that's not on the agenda or... That's against the law, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15554.693s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15555.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that... Because that... It doesn't... In the new policy, it doesn't state any item... Okay, it does state any item on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15564.795s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right, the only other concern I had was... And I heard this before, a couple of meetings back, was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15573.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: We asked for the full Medford Street address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15577.757s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so the concern is that what if a community member is displaced for whatever reason, whether they're homeless or in foster care, and they don't have a Medford resident address, you know, we specifically, you know, states that it must be a Medford Street address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15598.488s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that was something that was brought to my attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15602.591s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, a while back and I know you were working on these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15750.73s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, I would appreciate that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15991.032s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.529s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.809s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot and myself, we have a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15998.591s">[Kreatz]</a>: We haven't got to that point yet on the agenda to have the meeting start at a scheduled time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16007.138s">[Kreatz]</a>: We heard from community members, all of us, that they would like a designated time to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16015.345s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I know that what I've heard from the discussion was that you, during your subcommittee meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16025.029s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, kind of talking about, you know, having the possibility of having a meeting start, you know, maybe five, six flexible with the superintendent, and I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16035.875s">[Kreatz]</a>: However, what we've heard from the community is that, you know, I know that some of the reports that are presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16045.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: might be for us, but some of the community, you know, enjoys, you know, being part of that, you know, discussion and hearing it and, you know, has kind of asked us to have the meeting start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16058.419s">[Kreatz]</a>: At seven, which, you know, I tried to kind of go somewhere in the middle between six and seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16063.142s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, I just kind of came up with the middle time of 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16067.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: We've started a couple of our meetings at 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16070.705s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I do the goal of all of our meetings is to not have them go, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16078.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: hours and hours, you know, that's definitely a goal and I know that that's what this plan is, you know, trying to do is trying to, you know, reduce the amount of time that our meetings are going by having a, you know, a consolidated agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16095.051s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16097.751s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just concerned where now, you know, we're going to have, which, and I'm totally in support of not having the presentations for the public until at, you know, after 7pm or after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16111.603s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do agree with that so that people who are in work can go home, eat, you know, eat their dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16117.708s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then if they want to either join on Zoom or they're going to come down to the chamber, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16124.193s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's where I am with that because where I didn't, you know, I heard about your, um, I read, I'm sorry, not read, watched on YouTube after I had already done my resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16138.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16139.642s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it just was like, you know, the timing was like a coincidence, you know, I'm doing the resolution, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16144.745s">[Kreatz]</a>: Bandicoot, and then you were having a discussion, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16148.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, um, so, you know, I'm just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16152.469s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I am definitely I start work very early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16155.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know the administration does I know the teachers do and, you know, this is like my I don't know like 20th hour right now I'm losing my voice I can't think I'm, I have no voice you know it's just going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16167.687s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16169.349s">[Kreatz]</a>: and definitely in support of having earlier meetings but at the same time you know it's our duty to serve the public and and that's what has been pointed out to me by you know some of the public that you know we used to do our meetings at seven we every meeting started at seven and then once we had the pandemic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16190.984s">[Kreatz]</a>: we did kind of cut the, I mean, we started our meetings earlier because we were meeting earlier, but we went just as late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16201.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like we started, some of our meetings started last year at four, but we still met until 11 o'clock at night, you know, even though we, so we, we, we started to trend towards an earlier hour, you know, so I'm wondering if, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16217.955s">[Kreatz]</a>: if maybe, like, if we could come up with a set time so that the community knows that we're going to be starting our meetings at a set time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16225.181s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not gonna, you know, my resolution hasn't come up yet, so that's, you know, coming up in the future time, but we are talking about the gender at this time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16235.048s">[Kreatz]</a>: So from reading this, I'm not sure, like, what time are the meetings gonna start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16240.152s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just curious myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16241.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are they, you know, it doesn't seem like it's going to be set here for a specific time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16822.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: and try it and see how the public feels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm gonna have to abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.983s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just not ready to do the vote right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17486.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17487.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent, for the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17491.123s">[Kreatz]</a>: I make a motion to go ahead with signed option two for the front entrance of Medford High School to be put up for September 1st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17500.25s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is the same sign option that was preferred choice at the subcommittee meeting that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17505.293s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just labeled number six during the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17508.235s">[Kreatz]</a>: We just had more choices, but that was the preferred choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18403.458s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19106.737s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I would like to get the funding to find out what the cost would be before I make the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19113.822s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can we table this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6020.484s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6021.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to thank both students for coming out this evening and speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6025.927s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6026.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had a question because I've been seeing some chatter on Facebook about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6032.97s">[Kreatz]</a>: whether or not we still have a school resource officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6035.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to maybe clear up some confusion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6041.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: Would you be able to help answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=230.231s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=310.639s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, Paul Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=672.749s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor, I just wanted to say that for the good of the order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=676.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: I thought that the orientation that the superintendent put on and I think it was Dorothy from the MSC she had come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=685.275s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was very informative and a refresher for all of us as we're, you know, getting back into a new term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=693.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, because sometimes we can, we know what we're doing, but sometimes we can forget and get away from what we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=700.96s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I think it would be great and, you know, look forward to doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4102.584s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4103.285s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4104.125s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4106.167s">[Kreatz]</a>: Miss Hines Mr. Murphy and everybody for the report, and, you know, all the nurses for everything you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4113.392s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4116.534s">[Kreatz]</a>: Currently on our website, we do have the Medford School COVID exposure guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4122.897s">[Kreatz]</a>: So will that be updated for next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4126.759s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because it still has some of the information, you know, tested positive for COVID-19, must isolate for 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4134.382s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think that will have to be updated, you know, if we could, you know, in preparation for next week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7209.101s">[Kreatz]</a>: I spoke first, sorry, but I'll- It doesn't, you can go first, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7213.663s">[Kreatz]</a>: McLaughlin, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7307.526s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7309.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I thank you for bringing this to us, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7312.968s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7313.548s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have, I was reading number three and I just need some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7318.97s">[Kreatz]</a>: So do you mean that like, so for example, you know, I've been the chair for the building and grounds subcommittee and I have, you know, kind of developed the agenda with the assistance of Mr. Murphy, the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7334.875s">[Kreatz]</a>: the Director of Building and Grounds, and then community member input, what they're interested in hearing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7340.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: So for example, the Merritt High School sign was part of my agenda last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7346.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: This year, something that might be of interest would be bike racks for middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7353.649s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think I'm just confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7354.81s">[Kreatz]</a>: So are you saying that the chair would no longer create the agenda<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7362.939s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I would have to, or the person who's the chair would have to wait for something to get referred to the committee and how will that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7373.323s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess, you know, I had a lot of questions about number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7376.585s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was confused about number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7468.452s">[Kreatz]</a>: Just some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7471.394s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess I'm not following what you're saying I'm not talking about spending money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7475.618s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm simply talking about, you know, when I've been the chair of the building and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7482.965s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've received updates with exciting news from the vocational school, you know, different things the students are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7492.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not following what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7494.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean, I'm not talking about spending money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7498.239s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, sometimes the meetings would be informational where I would be receiving information about updates or where we are with statuses of, you know, like let's say the walkie talkies or, you know, where we are with like last year, for example, where we were with the sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7517.886s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not following and I'm sorry, maybe if there's somebody else that would be able to explain it to me a little bit easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7524.276s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just not following like, how would items get referred to like, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7532.87s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are you saying that the only way to have something referred to the subcommittee is what, what you've been doing all along which is like putting your resolution on the agenda so like if I wanted to have something on the, on my like let's say I was the chair of the building and grounds and I wanted to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7553.061s">[Kreatz]</a>: a discussion on bike racks and what do we think we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7557.044s">[Kreatz]</a>: What do we think we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7558.845s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're not talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7560.826s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're just talking about having a community discussion, which I did get some emails on earlier in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7568.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we wanted to do something with that meeting, but we were held off because it was the election time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7575.456s">[Kreatz]</a>: So we couldn't have subcommittee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7577.197s">[Kreatz]</a>: So at some point that might've been an agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7582.848s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess that I'm talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7585.109s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm still, I don't know what number three means in terms of how does an item get, if I'm the chair of a committee, how does the item get on that agenda for the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7598.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: Cause I used to be, or the chair would be the person who would build that agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7604.774s">[Kreatz]</a>: Does that help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7767.956s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have another follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7772.799s">[Kreatz]</a>: So for example, I'm just thinking back to other agendas I've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7778.421s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if I had four or five, six or seven things that I was going to put on the agenda, are you saying I would do seven resolutions or seven separate resolutions that I would be putting on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7796.556s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just something new and, you know, I'm just, I'm not sure where the mayor is going to be forming our subcommittees, you know, I don't know what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7806.434s">[Kreatz]</a>: What, what is my responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7808.135s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just, you know, I've been doing it the other way, building the agenda with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7814.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've been working with the superintendent, the finance director, director of, you know, building and grounds and sometimes even city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7822.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, you know, I, I haven't been, let's say bypassing the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7827.448s">[Kreatz]</a>: We would only vote for things to move it out to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7832.391s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then the full committee would take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7835.153s">[Kreatz]</a>: We never,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7836.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: voted on anything without the full support of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7843.262s">[Kreatz]</a>: The only thing that I'm seeing here differently is that in order for a chair to build their agenda, they first would have to add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7857.369s">[Kreatz]</a>: The agenda items to the regular school committee as a resolution, get approval before they, the person could go and then schedule their subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7868.801s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like I guess you know like I guess I was just looking for more instructions, you know, because if I take this vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7878.429s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have to know what I'm doing as a chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7882.691s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do you see what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7886.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: With instructions, because I've been doing it one way the whole time, this is just a new way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7891.916s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have to know it all the way through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7894.297s">[Kreatz]</a>: How am I going to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7897.659s">[Kreatz]</a>: The way that I described it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7900.402s">[Kreatz]</a>: how it's going to be so like if I have four items that I don't have any items right now in fact but if I had four items I would put four resolutions you know that I would like this to be resolved that it would go on the building ground subcommittee because we would have to take a vote on each separate resolution which would be separate agenda item<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7999.471s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=8000.412s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the way I understand it is to add a resolution and then it would get voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=8006.556s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then if it was approved, then I could go ahead and build the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3480.449s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3481.35s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3483.351s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3483.792s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3484.392s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3485.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, um, I have a question and you might've mentioned it and I just might've missed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3490.037s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, you did say that students will need to opt in to get the rapid test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3493.719s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wanted to know, um, are these, are they, is there going to be a distribution of the test kits and you know, they're going to be sent home every week or every two weeks, or is this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3505.201s">[Kreatz]</a>: they're still going to be doing the rapid tests in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3507.944s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just, I wasn't sure what that meant because I've been hearing some communications on the news where if schools opt in, they're going to be sending home the kits to the families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3517.775s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is that what we're doing or we're not doing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3627.084s">[Kreatz]</a>: And is there a new consent form in the works right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5230.136s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5234.26s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say, you know, this sounds so exciting and there's so many offerings and it's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5240.766s">[Kreatz]</a>: The staff that you mentioned, the 20 to 28 staff members who have already, you know, their willingness to participate in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5247.792s">[Kreatz]</a>: It just sounds incredible and it's very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9778.989s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9780.77s">[Kreatz]</a>: Before we, I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9784.313s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I was a little confused when I read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9788.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are you taking out, like this is, the way I read this is that you're removing residents may also submit their comments by writing the superintendent prior to the meeting or by emailing and provide the school, you know, school committee email prior to or during the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9804.756s">[Kreatz]</a>: item on the agenda, written comments must be kept to a length, which will allow them to be read into the record for less than three minutes, so forth, that whole sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9815.003s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then it picks up a welcome inclusive community, which it picks up down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9819.666s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it does, the way that the new section that you want us to add in, the way I read it, is that we're removing that you can email the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9833.569s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's how I read it too, and I'm not okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9844.294s">[Kreatz]</a>: Voted to use, to remove the school committee email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9848.756s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't remember doing that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10022.018s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had a follow up question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10023.439s">[Kreatz]</a>: So since the community can still write to that email address, you know, is there anywhere in this policy where we can state that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10035.397s">[Kreatz]</a>: you can continue to send your emails to this email, because like right now we're just removing that entire, you know, that piece about writing to the email and that the email will be received by all school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10048.24s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, they will be copied on all, you know, all those emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10052.421s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is there any way we can incorporate that here, you know, just a statement, you know, for transparency reasons that, you know, you can still continue to write this email address?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10065.175s">[Kreatz]</a>: because I really honestly, you know, I just remembered us, the situation happening differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10072.14s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do remember that Mr. Russo wasn't going to read all the statements or make a determination on whether some could be read or some could not be read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10081.726s">[Kreatz]</a>: But I do think that we should, you know, continue to keep the email address, you know, for transparency reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10102.213s">[Kreatz]</a>: In the policy, but not in this language that's going to go on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10121.292s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think even just a little asterisk with the footnote, I think would be helpful for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10127.916s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just gonna be one little, you know, italicized footnote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10798.112s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10799.307s">[Kreatz]</a>: I would like to motion that we move this to a committee of the whole meeting so that all members can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10805.733s">[Kreatz]</a>: I read through the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10808.556s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to first thank member Ruseau for putting this together in the time and effort that he must have spent putting this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10814.502s">[Kreatz]</a>: And as he mentioned in the email, he spent three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10818.145s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I don't think it's appropriate for us tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10821.008s">[Kreatz]</a>: to go through a document that he spent three years working on, and we're not gonna be able to provide our input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10828.451s">[Kreatz]</a>: We need to be able to provide some input and feedback and possible amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10834.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I think the only way we can do this is with a committee of the whole and going through line by line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10841.537s">[Kreatz]</a>: Now, I don't think some of the numbers necessarily, I don't have an issue with all the numbers, but I do have many questions on many numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10851.055s">[Kreatz]</a>: and I think we could go through it and go through like a set of 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10855.777s">[Kreatz]</a>: One to 10, approve, yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10857.817s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, what number do we wanna discuss?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10860.158s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't think we have to go through every single solitary number, but we need to do this as a group and not through a rule subcommittee, then come back here, and then we have more questions, and then it's just gonna go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10871.601s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I think the only way we could do this is with the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10873.942s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then we can have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11226.508s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11226.789s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11227.129s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11228.07s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11327.855s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11329.035s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I think I was confused about what this meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11333.518s">[Kreatz]</a>: So what you're saying is that you want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11339.197s">[Kreatz]</a>: You understand, and I understand, that four members of the committee constitute a quorum, and that a smaller group, which would be three, mean they could meet and adjourn from day to day, but that could be a violation of the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11355.091s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11355.892s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because that's a subcommittee, and a subcommittee would have to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11360.957s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess that, I was looking for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11414.088s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11414.568s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's what this, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11415.929s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I understand now this was just cleaning up the policy and you know, I, the way I read it, I thought you wanted to, you know, you know, appeal that members could meet and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11429.373s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I said, I was confused and I started reading open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11432.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11432.654s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11433.094s">[Kreatz]</a>: So you didn't need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11434.095s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11434.275s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12470.874s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted, I had a question and just maybe need some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12476.257s">[Kreatz]</a>: So is this flagship committee doing the research and making the recommendation whether it's going to be a new school, a refurbished high school, or is this committee deciding on the educational direction that we're taking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12492.749s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wasn't sure because of the MSBA information that was in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12497.532s">[Kreatz]</a>: a lot of the other goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12499.033s">[Kreatz]</a>: If somebody could clarify that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12600.006s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12600.387s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the committee will receive like the MSBA statement of interest that was submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12605.348s">[Kreatz]</a>: So they'll know what they're looking at and it's still going to take us probably another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12610.84s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, till the end of the year for us to hear back on whether we're going to get the MSDA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12614.903s">[Kreatz]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12615.504s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12616.105s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12616.465s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=185.799s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm in favor of doing that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=529.896s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, so I was actually going to bring up number nine, because last year, Paulette and I we put forth a resolution to change the start times of the meetings to 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=543.59s">[Kreatz]</a>: And because we had received feedback from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=548.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: last school year um that they preferred to start at 7 p.m and we had gotten we we had started at just different times like we were starting at 5 sometimes 6 sometimes 6 30 so we as a group um accepted the resolution and chose 6 30 you know as a happy medium for the public administrators etc um so i mean if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=575.896s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I guess like, how does everybody else feel about that start time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=580.921s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, could we try it at six and we might have to change this rule if it's not working out for the community, you know, to make it to the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=730.632s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1183.925s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep, so I'm not ready to vote on this yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1186.287s">[Kreatz]</a>: I didn't get to speak on it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1188.008s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did have concerns about the meeting in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1193.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not in favor of having a meeting in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1196.315s">[Kreatz]</a>: We haven't had meeting in August and I've been on school committee for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1201.099s">[Kreatz]</a>: Last year and the year before during COVID, we got an email from the superintendent with an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1209.386s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that went very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1212.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I would like to make a friendly amendment to have an email communication from the superintendent with an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1222.709s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if members have questions or concerns, they could speak directly with the superintendent during the summer over the phone if they have any questions or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1236.249s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm making a motion to amend this to, there will be, the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to the committee members in August, maybe the first Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1253.679s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I think what she was doing actually, I'm sorry, she was sending out updates every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1260.774s">[Kreatz]</a>: So let me just get back to what I was saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1263.755s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm making a motion to amend this to say the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to all members, a brief broadcast memo to all members each week in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1279.701s">[Kreatz]</a>: It doesn't have to be on a Monday, maybe on the Friday at the end of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2011.716s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, so I I'm, I'm not in favor of having a summer meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2015.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, you know, I still want to keep my motion on the floor to having, um, communication brought, you know, updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2024.773s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I think at any point, an emergency meeting can be called, you know, if we had to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2032.379s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm still gonna keep my amendment as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2035.442s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2163.15s">[Kreatz]</a>: I felt the same way, Mayor, and I actually had the same feedback written down that you just mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2169.653s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wanted to hear from the rest of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2241.852s">[Kreatz]</a>: I motion to change it to the following Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2415.411s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, um, yeah, so I was, I just want to get back to a kind of loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2420.776s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, here it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2421.296s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2422.357s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2422.617s">[Kreatz]</a>: So when I was reading this rule, I was just thinking back to earlier this month, the January 3 meeting was postponed until the 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2431.484s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, I just found out, you know, just by getting the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2436.488s">[Kreatz]</a>: the change date, zoom, um, you know, meeting request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2440.372s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, so I I'm not familiar with the current process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2444.216s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, you know, how was it handled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2446.458s">[Kreatz]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2447.66s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I don't think, you know, we've officially had a process to postpone it and it's been at the discretion of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2457.61s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2460.686s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm wondering if somebody could just maybe help answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2463.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because we haven't had a process or a rule on canceling or postponing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2470.216s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's typically been at the discretion of the superintendent or the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2564.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I was reading ahead and there's another number that connects with this number, I think, number 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2573.111s">[Kreatz]</a>: In the event of an emergency due to extraordinary circumstances, the requirement that notification of cancellation is provided in writing may be waived and members may notify the superintendent of their desire to cancel the meeting, email or in person, any verbal requests must be followed with a written request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2592.771s">[Kreatz]</a>: The two rules are in two different sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2596.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I think it should just be consolidated into one rule, you know, that goes, you know, into both of these situations, because we're talking about canceling a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2609.659s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, it should include in the event of an emergency, you know, in a situation like this, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2617.862s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's at the discretion of the superintendent to cancel the meeting by telephone, email, or in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2624.248s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, we did have, you know, if there is a snow storm the day of the meeting, you know, we would have to cancel the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2631.233s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, something like that could happen, especially in the winter months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2711.635s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I'm just trying to think of something I was gonna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2716.979s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, cause I know Mr. Russo wants the exact word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2722.003s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm trying to think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2724.045s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm making a motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2727.987s">[Kreatz]</a>: to amend number 14 to say no meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2733.489s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry, let me just catch my train of thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2742.853s">[Kreatz]</a>: The superintendent and or mayor have the discretion to cancel a meeting and notify all committee members via email as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3124.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3124.707s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I had similar questions, because, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3130.228s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think we first have to, you know, reach out to city council to ask if they are interested in having a joint meeting with us and work out the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3139.375s">[Kreatz]</a>: Uh, what, what is the meeting about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3141.196s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, uh, are we discussing goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3144.678s">[Kreatz]</a>: The pre budget goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3146.059s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are we discussing, you know, the, the budget information that we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3152.004s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was, I was just a little bit confused about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3155.266s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, this rule, the way it's presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3159.722s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm unclear about it myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3299.27s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3301.207s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, yes, I'm member Ruseau, would you be willing to amended to say something like the chair will schedule to optional annual joint meetings with the city council, a budget meeting will be held in the spring of the, you know, of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3320.515s">[Kreatz]</a>: a general meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3321.475s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I guess I'm confused about the general meeting in March on goals, because I'm thinking spring is typically March, April, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3469.089s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3469.709s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I'm amenable to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3471.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I motion to change the word wording to say the chair will schedule one annual joint meeting with the city council and everything else that was previously stated will remain the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3560.178s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I was reading through, I'm just going all the way to 30, just let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3568.523s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so let me just get back up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3575.327s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just reading my notes that I wrote about one of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3577.929s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm on number 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3583.339s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, in number 21, in number 22, I noticed something, but I wasn't sure why it wasn't in number 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3594.542s">[Kreatz]</a>: So in the rule 22, it states the meeting will not be broadcast or recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3601.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: However, being a public meeting, the meeting will allow members of the public to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3606.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: The public will not be offered an opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3610.546s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3612.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, that was in rule 22, it wasn't in rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3615.609s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wasn't sure, you know, the workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3625.216s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're not gonna have the public come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3628.018s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not gonna be broadcasted because we're getting training on something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3632.562s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what is the difference between that and the retreat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3637.706s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think I was getting the two, the workshop and the retreat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3640.749s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was just thinking about when the MASC was here and I think we called it a retreat and Dorothy came in and we didn't invite members of the public to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3652.378s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we had a discussion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3655.14s">[Kreatz]</a>: on our own, where we could talk and, you know, converse, ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3660.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: We didn't, it wasn't recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3664.242s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we didn't invite members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3666.503s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm not sure if how everybody feels about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3673.844s">[Kreatz]</a>: If somebody members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3797.6s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I motion to accept that friendly suggestion to strike 21 and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3805.942s">[Kreatz]</a>: change, well, combine it and just make it one, you know, one rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3811.345s">[Kreatz]</a>: Workshops and or retreats may be scheduled on an as-needed basis and everything else would be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3864.158s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, on number 23, I'm just not really sure I follow this rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3872.742s">[Kreatz]</a>: It says the chair or vice chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting and help focus on the agenda and superintendent on the goals of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3890.729s">[Kreatz]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3894.363s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I, we, we haven't been doing something like that, um, where the vice chair has been collaborating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3903.17s">[Kreatz]</a>: With the superintendent and the mayor about the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3907.573s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I, I was making a motion to, to, you know, to strike just the word, the vice chair, the chair, or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3919.056s">[Kreatz]</a>: The chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop, or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting to help focus both the agenda of the school committee and the superintendent on goals of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3936.551s">[Kreatz]</a>: Such standing meetings will be held with agreement between the superintendent and the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3943.417s">[Kreatz]</a>: And the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3944.918s">[Kreatz]</a>: It would also just be me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4089.763s">[Kreatz]</a>: How do you feel about the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4093.072s">[Kreatz]</a>: the way it's proposed and superintendent, I would just like to hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4202.745s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4207.089s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm going to amend it to say the chair of the school committee, and when unavailable, will delegate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4221.582s">[Kreatz]</a>: To the vice chair, when needed, have a standing meeting and continue, everything else is gonna be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4229.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: And at the end, the last sentence will say, such standing meetings will be held by agreement between the superintendent and the chair or vice chair if delegated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4338.721s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm going to get it ready right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4793.677s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry, I was emailing Mr. Russo at the same time, and I missed what number we're talking about right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4830.97s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have a question about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4832.091s">[Kreatz]</a>: So are we gonna, does this mean the school committee we're going to evaluate each other's performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4842.119s">[Kreatz]</a>: May I know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4942.282s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I actually had that written down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4944.943s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was gonna make a motion that we, and I know Mr. Russo wants the exact wording, so I'm just gonna read what it says right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4957.512s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so agenda for all regular meetings by the school committee will be available to the public and press copies of the agenda will be filed with the office and clerk and posted on the website of the school committee, no later than Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4972.025s">[Kreatz]</a>: Prior to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4973.326s">[Kreatz]</a>: Prior to the scheduled meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4977.699s">[Kreatz]</a>: copies of the agenda will be made available at the Medford Public Library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4982.46s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is that something that we currently do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4985.621s">[Kreatz]</a>: Copies at the Medford Public Library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4991.843s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4992.503s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wanna strike that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4997.545s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so copies made available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4999.725s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so let me just go back one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5002.646s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm gonna delete that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5008.49s">[Kreatz]</a>: just as you just deleted copies of the agenda will be posted on line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5013.331s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because that is what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5017.652s">[Kreatz]</a>: We post the agenda online, and it's it's broadcasting of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5128.196s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5128.977s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5488.37s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, right, that was gonna get removed, yes, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5538.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to change it to 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5575.85s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor, I had a question on, sorry, I'm just trying to, it was an earlier number, I didn't get to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5583.657s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was in the 40s, I'm getting there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5588.061s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, it was number 40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5591.282s">[Kreatz]</a>: The agenda will include a listing of all recommendations being brought forward such as listing with a formatted format in accordance with the be dB agenda creation and format regular meetings the agenda will also include a listing of all motions reports and other communications and reports to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5609.947s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that is currently what we're doing, but it doesn't right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5616.148s">[Kreatz]</a>: The agenda does not contain a listing of all the motions that we've taken at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5625.551s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm just motioning to remove that word<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5632.546s">[Kreatz]</a>: because right now the agenda doesn't list all the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5641.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5642.409s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, so motion to change the word to resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5717.052s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5724.042s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, okay, sorry, because when I minimize and maximize, I get back, sorry, I'm going there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5729.527s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so number 52, I am not in favor of the way that this is, the way that the rule is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5739.495s">[Kreatz]</a>: The rule states public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda that I'm fine with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5750.959s">[Kreatz]</a>: Members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form provided for said purpose by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5761.308s">[Kreatz]</a>: That I would like to remove that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5765.892s">[Kreatz]</a>: The chair may limit the comment to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5768.174s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm fine with that on the number of individuals signed up to speak, but okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5774.179s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the chair may limit the comments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5779.551s">[Kreatz]</a>: for public participation to two minutes as needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5783.474s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if it was a busy night, the chair will announce the time limit prior to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5791.241s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, at every regular meeting, the public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing via email or by emailing the superintendent that we're currently doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5801.43s">[Kreatz]</a>: Written comments will be forwarded to all members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5804.452s">[Kreatz]</a>: That is what Mr. Russo is doing currently right now with the auto forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5809.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we had discussion about this at our last meeting, and we are going to, I think, be moving away from submitting the comments via email, or we're not going to be reading them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5827.743s">[Kreatz]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5830.144s">[Kreatz]</a>: I definitely want to remove<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5835.239s">[Kreatz]</a>: The part where it says members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5842.726s">[Kreatz]</a>: That is an inconvenience for the public to register and what their comments are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5848.812s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm not in favor of the way that this is currently written and I'm proposing to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5855.239s">[Kreatz]</a>: removing that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6201.724s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, yeah, that's, I motion second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6206.546s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6540.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6541.87s">[Kreatz]</a>: What group of numbers are we going to talk about next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6544.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to just get through, look at my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6571.327s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't have any questions on any of those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6591.141s">[Kreatz]</a>: I can wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6592.582s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have a question on 77, so I can hold off for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7102.691s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I was going to ask for some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7105.153s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so, so this rule essentially is giving us the permission to suspend the rules, to move an agenda item out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7116.923s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's, that's what you're saying, Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7118.545s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7118.765s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7186.544s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I forgot to lower my hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6737.727s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, the data will tell a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6738.848s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6741.379s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6742.599s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you for the report, and I think it's great, the proposal that you have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6746.442s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had a question, because you're going to preclude the four-day week option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6753.045s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do we currently have families that are enrolled in that right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6785.941s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, I'm just curious like if we're gonna reach out to those families to just let them know that, you know, in advance, these are gonna be some changes and you can either drop down to three or increase to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6797.826s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then there's also the tuition, you know, application for a discount if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6803.288s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6804.289s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6805.729s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5997.241s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to thank you for your speech and for the presentation and also I wanted to mention and say thank you to all the teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6007.558s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6238.894s">[Kreatz]</a>: Attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=546.99s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I'll make a macro statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=550.412s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wanna thank Dr. Edward-Vincent for her leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=554.495s">[Kreatz]</a>: She supports all students, teachers, reading her goals and evaluation that her pre-evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=562.481s">[Kreatz]</a>: She's been to school events, community events, many, many meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=569.966s">[Kreatz]</a>: She's, you know, she provides the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=574.229s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, the weekly bulletin update every week, sharing the news, and, you know, just piggyback on what the mayor said and what Melanie said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=584.24s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's, you know, she spends all of her time dedicated to the Medford Public Schools, the needs of the students, the community, the families,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=594.712s">[Kreatz]</a>: And she's responsive to the school committee members and our requests and our needs and at all hours of the day and she just she works tirelessly and so I just wanted to, you know, share that and I've, you know, was on the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=610.733s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was on the superintendent search as well, you know, as a school committee member, and we, you know, got to meet superintendent Dr. Robinson at that time and just got to know her very, very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=623.118s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's like we're a close family, everybody, the committee, the administration, the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=629.52s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to thank her for her dedication and her leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1400.196s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1401.157s">[Kreatz]</a>: Maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1406.742s">[Kreatz]</a>: The score was 3.77.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1407.542s">[Kreatz]</a>: There has been some progress and we have much work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1412.387s">[Kreatz]</a>: Equity is perhaps our biggest need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1415.189s">[Kreatz]</a>: Creating a strategic plan or goal around just this issue would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1419.753s">[Kreatz]</a>: Defining equity would be a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2418.768s">[Kreatz]</a>: I can take standard two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2648.326s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2648.746s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so I'll start on standard two, management and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2656.313s">[Kreatz]</a>: The score was 3.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2658.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: There is feedback under several of the sections under standard two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2663.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'll read the feedback for standard two, and then I'll, you know, continue on with the score for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2671.764s">[Kreatz]</a>: subset and read the comments for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2674.004s">[Kreatz]</a>: So standard two management operations 3.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2677.805s">[Kreatz]</a>: The changes to the budget this year were effective and efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2681.446s">[Kreatz]</a>: The committee was able to get a comprehensive view of the priorities and discuss in a positive and productive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2687.807s">[Kreatz]</a>: The state of the district system is poor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2690.087s">[Kreatz]</a>: By systems, I'm referring to processes, technology, and people that comprise the foundation and infrastructure on which the district runs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2698.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: There needs to be people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2700.789s">[Kreatz]</a>: There needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2701.59s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry I'm just missing my spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2704.474s">[Kreatz]</a>: There needs to be considerable focus, moving forward and prioritize a well run set of administrative functions without improvements on the administrative side of the house, the districts continued improvement in curriculum,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2716.708s">[Kreatz]</a>: and instruction will be limited compliance with school committee policy is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2721.31s">[Kreatz]</a>: And in the case of out of out of school suspension policy inadequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2725.392s">[Kreatz]</a>: The committee proactively provided an extensive amount of planning time as the administration to come back to us with any changes that they felt would be needed to operate operationalize the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2736.598s">[Kreatz]</a>: and to articulate what financial supports are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2739.78s">[Kreatz]</a>: None of this occurred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2741.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: Students appear to be regularly suspended this year, which is complete conflict with the policy set forward by the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2748.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: As another example, the committee also adopted policy that outlines regular reports, and went throughout the school year, we expect to receive them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2756.628s">[Kreatz]</a>: There has been no acknowledgement of or accounting for those reports this academic year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2763.444s">[Kreatz]</a>: 2.1 environment the score was 2.97.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2767.086s">[Kreatz]</a>: We are beginning to evaluate operational systems in a district that has long been without.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2773.072s">[Kreatz]</a>: The next one was 2.2 2.2 human resources management and development score was 3.24 a standard report of other school committee committees receives is the personnel report continuing hires termination leaves of absence workers conversation and other positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2792.541s">[Kreatz]</a>: This report is invaluable for understanding the state of the organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2797.203s">[Kreatz]</a>: This report is received monthly, or more often other districts, while it is understood that due to disconnected software systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2805.268s">[Kreatz]</a>: This report cannot be generated without substantial work effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2809.191s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's we have not pressed for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2811.672s">[Kreatz]</a>: There does not seem to be a plan to replace this disconnect software system, so that the administration can begin providing this critical report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2819.677s">[Kreatz]</a>: This report is more than nice to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2821.998s">[Kreatz]</a>: It is considered mandatory and members of other school committees are shocked we don't get this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2827.419s">[Kreatz]</a>: Identifying a path forward to replace the software systems or connect them or merely to fund some kind of a project to make these reports easily generated is something we would like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2837.582s">[Kreatz]</a>: So this is critical report can be generated and supplied to the committee is something we hope we can start in the coming year or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2846.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: Then we have 2.3 scheduling and management information systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2851.293s">[Kreatz]</a>: The score was 2.84.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2853.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: There are still multiple calendars throughout the member public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2857.53s">[Kreatz]</a>: These multiple calendaring systems, which do not speak to each other result in predictable failures, such as double booking of spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2865.276s">[Kreatz]</a>: This issue has risen to the forefront numerous times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2868.658s">[Kreatz]</a>: The committee has made clear our desire for a single calendaring system, or at least some of the operationalized method to ensure the problems of the multiple sources of truth is resolved and to improve transparency about who was using our space<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2883.441s">[Kreatz]</a>: and for non-NPS affiliated groups, what they are paying for the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2889.183s">[Kreatz]</a>: And law ethics, 2.4, law ethics and policies, the score was 3.11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2895.225s">[Kreatz]</a>: 2.5 fiscal systems, the score was 3.56.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2901.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: And the overall score overall was 3.15 for standard two management and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=3.067s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=84.377s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=251.785s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to accept the revisions from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=255.466s">[Kreatz]</a>: McLaughlin for the superintendent's evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=459.077s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I was going to say the same thing that I didn't have any revisions to my end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=464.278s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Russo, before he went on vacation, he already updated my comments and the mayor's comments and shared it with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=472.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: Everything else was fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=473.5s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do think this year it was a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=477.981s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know that we're not allowed to see each other's evaluations, but this time we weren't given the opportunity to even see our own evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=489.204s">[Kreatz]</a>: in the final version so I think you know maybe in the future if we can be shared okay this is what I have for your evaluation can you review it and let me know if it's okay whoever's doing it or everything could be sent in maybe to the superintendent secretary and she could review it you know everybody's individually so that we're not looking at them so that there's another set of eyes on them because I was reading some of the instructions and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=518.712s">[Kreatz]</a>: When you look at the instructions for one, two, three, and four, in order for somebody to get a one or a two or a three, something has to be, so to speak, like broken in the prior evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=534.378s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was thinking there has to be a cross-examination between the prior evaluation and the current evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=543.938s">[Kreatz]</a>: for individual evaluations to ensure that the numbers are recorded correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=550.706s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=553.409s">[Kreatz]</a>: I find the whole process to be very complicated and confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=556.293s">[Kreatz]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=556.954s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I really wish it was easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=559.337s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just, I don't like the current process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=562.26s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know that Mr. Russo said some of us didn't follow the instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=566.741s">[Kreatz]</a>: I tried my best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=568.502s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's a confusing form, so I just did it myself on Excel and sent it in that way because I didn't like the Google Sheets, the way that I don't like how they're filled in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=578.624s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I did it the alternative way and sent it in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=583.572s">[Kreatz]</a>: but I'm just sharing my thoughts, but I don't have any changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=586.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm just, I thought the meeting was just to hear the, receive the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=591.897s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then once Mr. Russo gets back, the averages can be redone and then it can be sent off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=909.369s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=953.24s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1323.593s">[Kreatz]</a>: I motion with the reward, the way it was rewarded by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1144.09s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, yes, I want to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1146.256s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1146.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: And last year I got to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1149.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: go to the live open house and see some of the updated programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1152.597s">[Kreatz]</a>: They look fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1154.038s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if you would briefly be able to describe what the mass core framework is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1161.243s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know I got it described in an email and I just thought it was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1165.106s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if you were able to share it, if you could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1168.788s">[Kreatz]</a>: So mass core?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1169.809s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1181.25s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1229.651s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1231.653s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know when the fall advisory meeting is going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1236.237s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, is there going to be, like, in the fall advisory meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1242.823s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1244.084s">[Kreatz]</a>: And one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1246.146s">[Kreatz]</a>: When my son was at the vocational as a student,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1249.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, there was some limitations with the scheduling, um, with extracurriculars in world language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1255.919s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I was just wondering, um, if, if that's going to be something that might be worked on into the schedules where, um, those opportunities might be more available for the students, for the CTE students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1266.721s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we can get a new master schedule, that's the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1269.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1269.522s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1270.762s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had received some information in an email, but I just wanted to kind of just put that out there that that's something that I believe the district, the administration's working on to try and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1279.847s">[Kreatz]</a>: get the schedule and get that in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1483.637s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1484.237s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2296.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2300.491s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2300.832s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2301.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I had a similar question that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2304.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham had, was how do interested community members<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2307.674s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, find out about opportunities and you've already answered it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2310.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2311.436s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2313.217s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=100.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=102.451s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=104.492s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=106.753s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1255.442s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had just chosen one, but I had chosen data-informed decision-making, but the instruction makes perfect sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1486.131s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had A also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1488.692s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had A and I also had, because I felt like we do the budget, I had fiscal systems develops a budget that supports the district's vision, but I don't know if that's gonna come in another section or if it's just not really part of the evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1964.644s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1968.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I definitely think managing conflict, definite on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1973.61s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's tough with the A and the B, like, I think I would choose A over B. It's tough because then we're going to get into too many indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1987.54s">[Kreatz]</a>: But they're both important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1989.401s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very, it's very tricky to narrow it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1999.633s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what does the superintendent think so far of, um, of what we've, um, so far approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2077.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2436.299s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2437.299s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to use those words, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2458.469s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2461.991s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, the words are exemplary for standard, sorry Democrats, we don't get to decide the words directly in the required just to clarify what they were I thought you wanted to know what they were as part of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2482.166s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just was clarifying what the motion was, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2485.048s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was gonna read it out in full if you want me to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2487.429s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2488.349s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2773.681s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2775.502s">[Kreatz]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2775.942s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just think that it's a complicated process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2778.784s">[Kreatz]</a>: And having this special, or the subcommittee, I think would be necessary each year, unless it's determined it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=2984.7s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Sharon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=762.444s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=763.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz, then Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=766.688s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=767.288s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=767.788s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, so I, you know, I just jotted down a few goals and a lot of them are similar to what some of my colleagues have talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=774.43s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, one of the goals that I thought was important, which we are working on is, you know, improving the superintendent rating process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=783.052s">[Kreatz]</a>: We just met about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=784.612s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I think that could be one of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=786.693s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's something that we could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=788.207s">[Kreatz]</a>: accomplished like within the next six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=790.768s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was thinking that might be, you know, one of the goals that we could do, cause we are working towards that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=795.41s">[Kreatz]</a>: It is something that smart goal it's attainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=798.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: We could do it within the six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=800.652s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, another, um, piece would be the communication, which is also being addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=806.974s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's on everybody's minds and it's on everybody's goal list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=810.595s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, it's being addressed with the superintendent, you know, improving the communication as part of that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=815.775s">[Kreatz]</a>: would be something that we did make a motion about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=818.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't know if it's something we could accomplish, would be looking into improving the internet service at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=824.82s">[Kreatz]</a>: We already have a motion in for this, but it's something that's important to all of us during the communication process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=831.643s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't know for sure if it's obtainable within six months, but it's something that, you know, we made a motion, we're looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=838.427s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, there's no promises, but we are looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=841.709s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and then along with that would be like improving the climate at Medford high school, which is also being worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=847.593s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just something that's on everybody's minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=849.814s">[Kreatz]</a>: But, um, at the same time, you know, considering all the schools, K to 12, not just Medford high school, but all the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=857.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, cause I know we, in some of the messages we got, um, you know, some questions were, Oh, is this going to be done for all the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=864.233s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, you know, that's something that, you know, could be done maybe not within the six months, but you know, within the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=870.936s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and, and then my question would be for tonight is, you know, are we, are we making a decision on how many goals, like whether it's going to be one, two, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=882.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think if I was to look at the superintendent's goals, you know, she has the three, you know, high level goals and then the actions that fall underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=891.612s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was, you know, I just, I wasn't sure exactly what we were doing at tonight's meeting, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=899.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5096.277s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5097.338s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, my name is Kathy Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5099.822s">[Kreatz]</a>: I live at 391 Fulton Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5103.387s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sorry, I can't be there tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5105.029s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had something going on here at the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5108.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep, so I just wanted to, you know, kind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5111.277s">[Kreatz]</a>: to set something clear is, you know, the first time as a school committee member that I heard about this raise was by reading it on the city council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5123.303s">[Kreatz]</a>: This was not something that the school committee discussed or even received any communications from the city council on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5133.289s">[Kreatz]</a>: We were, you know, in my own personal opinion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5137.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're not even thinking about a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5140.013s">[Kreatz]</a>: This wasn't even something we were discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5143.516s">[Kreatz]</a>: In eight years that I've been on school committee, at one point, there was a raise discussed years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5150.562s">[Kreatz]</a>: This was before COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5152.704s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we declined, voted it down, because we wanted to make sure that if there was any additional funds, it went to the school budget, to the teachers, to the students, and the needs of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5166.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if there's any additional money, which there isn't, it should go directly to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5173.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: It should go to the needs of the students and the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5177.763s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I've heard from, you know, a lot of the members that have spoken tonight and the community has come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5184.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, I totally agree that if there's extra money, this extra money for salaries should go to the parents to raise their salaries, not the school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5196.555s">[Kreatz]</a>: Our job is a volunteer job, and I've been doing it for eight years, not expecting any pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5205.904s">[Kreatz]</a>: It requires dedication, love, commitment, just being there to hear and understand and listen to the needs of everybody in the community, the teachers, the students, the families, caregivers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5221.278s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's not about the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5222.619s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was confused about the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5225.622s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where did they come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5227.304s">[Kreatz]</a>: Who did they speak to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5229.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5231.488s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to set it clear that the school committee did not have any meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5236.473s">[Kreatz]</a>: We were not talking about raising our salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5239.096s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm talking from my own personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5241.017s">[Kreatz]</a>: Nobody's reached out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5242.839s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was not a thought in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5244.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was surprised and confused and disheartened by the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5250.042s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just something that we're not expecting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5253.884s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I did hear, I got into the meeting late, but I did hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5259.326s">[Kreatz]</a>: Rick Caraviello, Councilor Caraviello mentioned that a pay cut in their salaries to make the salaries equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5267.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I think that would be the best way to make the salaries equal across the two different, you know, boards between the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5278.517s">[Kreatz]</a>: If there's going to be any changes, then maybe a decrease in the salary to bring the councilor salary back down to the school committee salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5287.822s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so I got my point across and I wasn't prepared and ready to speak, but I just hope that I made it clear that I object to this resolution and I hope and I pray that it does not pass tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5304.907s">[Kreatz]</a>: And thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5306.488s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>
