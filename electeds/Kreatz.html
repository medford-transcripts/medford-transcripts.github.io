    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.061s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.962s">[Kreatz]</a>: We'd like it read, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: Pretz has some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=471.665s">[Kreatz]</a>: Superintendent, I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=493.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: But what I found out through e-mail communication was that's something that's not possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=499.92s">[Kreatz]</a>: Currently there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=505.842s">[Kreatz]</a>: or add an additional document, or attach a separate page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=510.484s">[Kreatz]</a>: So what they can do is the guidance Councilor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance Councilor write the personal accomplishments about the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=532.012s">[Kreatz]</a>: but you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=551.151s">[Kreatz]</a>: I thought it was going to be something different than what we motioned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=756.86s">[Kreatz]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=763.235s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's not an emergency matter but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=775.721s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just something really interesting but it's not an emergency report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=780.163s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like to make a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=810.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=811.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wanted to inquire about one shop in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=816.608s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was the robotics engineering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=818.508s">[Kreatz]</a>: Originally, the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=827.972s">[Kreatz]</a>: And just recently, there's been a development where there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=835.234s">[Kreatz]</a>: there is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=852.518s">[Kreatz]</a>: going out doing the college tours, and what we saw was at Wentworth, they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop, and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines, and in fact, we have newer machines than they have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=871.167s">[Kreatz]</a>: know, they have like a five access and we have a three access, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford vocational school has that equipment that's college ready and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops and they're starting out at $15 an hour<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=892.927s">[Kreatz]</a>: and that's what our vocational students are doing in that particular field, so I really think it's an important, you know, to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as, you know, the A week, B week program, and this was a new development that just came about, you know, recently for an opportunity for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=916.076s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to have that revisited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2179.562s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2184.644s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was great hearing from all of you It was just wonderful, and you know what great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2189.246s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're doing at the school and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2199.37s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2206.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2217.479s">[Kreatz]</a>: helped organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school, and it was just fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2222.385s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2226.29s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just love it there, and it's just a great school, and thank you all for what you do every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2230.835s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3605.587s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3605.767s">[Kreatz]</a>: Katz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3606.367s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi Dr. Rodelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3607.407s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say I really love this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3609.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it's absolutely fantastic and it's just gonna teach the students a very valuable life lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3615.209s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was just so interested and I really love Monopoly and it reminds me of the real life Monopoly game and I just love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3622.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: It just sounds like so much fun and some of the articles online that the students were faced with unexpected circumstances where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3629.952s">[Kreatz]</a>: their car breaks down and they have to make a decision on what are they going to do or their vet has to go to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3636.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry, their pet has to go to the vet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3639.138s">[Kreatz]</a>: But it just, it just sounds like so much fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3642.841s">[Kreatz]</a>: It really does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3643.821s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, it's going to be a valuable life lesson to learn how to balance a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3648.825s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I know a lot of, you know, students, my son's just learning how to do a checkbook and it's just so important to learn how to spend your money and manage it and pay bills and know what you have to take priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3660.052s">[Kreatz]</a>: But it's wonderful, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3661.973s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, you're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4298.766s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's good seeing you and I'm running into you everywhere with the signature board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4302.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I'm so happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4305.187s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was kind of brainstorming and I had some ideas and I just, I'm gonna share them, but I was thinking for beautifying some of the schools, maybe planting some perennials, like the plants that are low maintenance will come back every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4319.39s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, basically when you kind of go up to the community school entrance, there's like this cement block and it's like maybe weeds now, but like if we could put some perennials there and maybe dress up some of the greens and just because that's like such an open space and everybody's going in there to access the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4343.286s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and then talk at one point that, you know, doing space, turning it into an outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4359.93s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, peaceful place, you know, for the seniors to go at lunch and, you know, kind of just dressing it up a little bit with some benches and, you know, it would be like senior privilege where they could go out to that open space and, you know, it'd look really pretty when you're walking through to go into the other building and I had that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4377.168s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then the parks, I had the parks right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4379.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was like, oh, the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4380.371s">[Kreatz]</a>: We could take care of the parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6586.737s">[Kreatz]</a>: I can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6588.618s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have training at my work, and then I'm on the advisory committee, so I can't go that week either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=429.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=430.221s">[Kreatz]</a>: We'd like it read, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6551.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have training at my work, and then I'm on the advisory committee, so I can't go that week either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7152.887s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, I know, we're a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7155.61s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7494.491s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh my gosh, what do you do? Do you have.... yes, well that's just... well look at this. And I'm listening a bit and I'm like, it's right here. I'm trying to salvage the note. I'll have to rewrite it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7527.0s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know what I'll do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7528.193s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's not much here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7529.614s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll turn this, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7530.634s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7531.054s">[Kreatz]</a>: Right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7639.49s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7641.713s">[Kreatz]</a>: Could we, I just wasn't sure, are we meeting this Wednesday with the McGlynn teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8049.392s">[Kreatz]</a>: Miss Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8050.033s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, um, Superintendent Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8051.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to follow up with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8053.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, I was in touch with Miss Simonides and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the M.I.A.A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8060.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: regarding the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8062.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: If you've had a chance to file that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8148.902s">[Kreatz]</a>: did you communicate that information to the parent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8164.934s">[Kreatz]</a>: So you got the name and the person is not certified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8169.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13680.833s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13681.013s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13684.117s">[Kreatz]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13684.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13686.599s">[Kreatz]</a>: It does mention, I was going to ask about the cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13689.122s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13693.986s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall where a lot of parents were very concerned because a lot of cameras were out and they weren't operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13703.775s">[Kreatz]</a>: So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15312.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: The wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15992.13s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15992.31s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15994.411s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had a similar question about the forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15996.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to know, are the forms going to be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents where they can go in and add their information and move it along?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16007.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16428.877s">[Kreatz]</a>: Does the motion that this meeting be adjourned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16431.078s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have one very quick announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16435.098s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just want to make one quick announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16438.919s">[Kreatz]</a>: There are several Medford High School students who created a new educational series.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16444.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: The name of the series is The Chronicles of Modern Military History.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16484.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: All of the students that are involved in this program are writing, editing, they're doing the music, the narrating, and they're coming in after school hours and just working on this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16500.998s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's been a wonderful episode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16502.98s">[Kreatz]</a>: We've been sharing it on Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16504.922s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm gonna get a message over to Lisa Evangelista to ask her to share the link on the blog if anybody gets a chance to tune in and it's just a great new show that's been created by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16518.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: several students, a combination of high school and vocational students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16523.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to give a couple of mentions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16526.699s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's been Flood, Matt Adaletto, Justin Garland, Angel Barozo, Ian Agudo, Gavin Bibbins, and Trip Hill, and narrated by Noah Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16541.091s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if everybody gets a chance, if they want to tune into the station, it's just a great educational episode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16547.797s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=489.832s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=490.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: Nice to meet you, Dr. Strait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=491.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=491.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: You too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=492.353s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=493.034s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, as you know, we have 18 approved vocational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=497.215s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=497.555s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=500.396s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=505.279s">[Kreatz]</a>: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=508.341s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=514.285s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I can repeat that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=515.446s">[Kreatz]</a>: Please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=517.167s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=517.787s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the first part is, how would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=526.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=535.109s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=535.889s">[Kreatz]</a>: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=765.588s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=766.168s">[Kreatz]</a>: That answers the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=767.208s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=770.85s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, we'll go around again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=771.55s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=771.81s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=772.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Trevena.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2024.275s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have kind of part two on my vocational question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2028.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you work with the school administration to continue to promote career and technical education in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2037.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2038.364s">[Kreatz]</a>: There wasn't any other questions to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2039.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2149.853s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2150.773s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6193.33s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll have to find you to get more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6264.047s">[Kreatz]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6871.676s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6872.036s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, Dr. Perla.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6873.637s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, so I have a question, some vocational questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6878.239s">[Kreatz]</a>: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6883.28s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6886.342s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6890.303s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7010.399s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8456.309s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8943.464s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8944.805s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have another question regarding the vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8948.687s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you work with the current administration to continue to promote career in technical education in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9023.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just have one follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9025.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you allocate money to support the programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9029.21s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know a lot of the programs, some of them have a higher number of enrollment versus others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9036.356s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what would you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9038.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do you have any experience writing grants to request money to support some of the programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9115.73s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=69.618s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1159.941s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1160.321s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, Dr. Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1161.882s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1162.423s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1162.923s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I have this one question has three parts, if you want to write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1167.747s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1168.567s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know the other night it was a long question, so they wrote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1171.43s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'll read it slowly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1173.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational CTE programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1184.772s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1190.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1197.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1458.526s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4310.483s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4311.983s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4313.804s">[Kreatz]</a>: So as you know, this is another vocational question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4317.425s">[Kreatz]</a>: So how would you work with the school administration to continue to promote the career technical education in Medford, increase the enrollment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4328.032s">[Kreatz]</a>: and keeping the kids coming to Medford vocational schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7410.737s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hello, hi Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7413.044s">[Kreatz]</a>: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational CTE programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7418.95s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you enhance the programs already in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7422.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7427.719s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7432.724s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I can repeat that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7440.673s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, already in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7442.974s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then secondly, what is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7454.279s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7777.998s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7778.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: That answers the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7779.659s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11153.35s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11153.87s">[Kreatz]</a>: How you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11154.431s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11158.973s">[Kreatz]</a>: How would you work with the school administration to continue to promote career and technical education, increase the enrollment numbers, and keep the students here at Medford High School participating in career and technical education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11351.684s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=41.525s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=42.926s">[Kreatz]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=44.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. Kierkegaard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=45.468s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=45.768s">[Kreatz]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=48.189s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Ricciaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=48.83s">[Kreatz]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=51.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=51.852s">[Kreatz]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=53.453s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=54.293s">[Kreatz]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=55.014s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=55.554s">[Kreatz]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5577.089s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think it's something that was mentioned earlier,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5587.771s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just the communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5590.572s">[Kreatz]</a>: A lot of parents often say they want to hear a lot of communication and what's happening in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5600.176s">[Kreatz]</a>: Very good response between the superintendent and I guess community involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5607.48s">[Kreatz]</a>: So those are some things that are important for the superintendent as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1786.152s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1787.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was thinking, I heard from Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1790.415s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot, and so I was wondering, I was thinking that in the future, if we knew early enough, could we plan like a civic field trip where maybe one of the teachers could go along with the students and go into town with parent permission<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1807.03s">[Kreatz]</a>: to go into the strike or, you know, the protest with adult supervision and as long as they had their parental permissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1890.578s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know how many students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1893.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: do we know if any students attended the strike that day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1896.962s">[Kreatz]</a>: Another parent had asked me, she said, do you know how many students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1900.383s">[Kreatz]</a>: Or we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1921.693s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know if during the day were there discussions maybe at, you know, at civic class or history class to just talk about the climate strike with the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1933.041s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was just, I also received that question from parents, like did they actually engage in discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2025.396s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had one more, because I know, I think it was last year, where there was a walk-in, where the students didn't actually walk out, but they were allowed to walk into the gymnasium or the cafeteria for about 10 to 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2038.642s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was like a safe walk, where they could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2041.723s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was another idea that we could do if the students still wanted to have a strike, they could do it within the school at a certain time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2050.847s">[Kreatz]</a>: But that was just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2054.069s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3243.993s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I would be happy to chair the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3255.762s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3256.042s">[Kreatz]</a>: So yes, I did talk with Mayor about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3259.764s">[Kreatz]</a>: And even Mr. Brown, he is interested on serving as a volunteer on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3266.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: And he can bring his expertise to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3269.732s">[Kreatz]</a>: We also want to have some ideas, just brainstorming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3273.895s">[Kreatz]</a>: doing some tours, walking around the school, and just putting together a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3280.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: We know that we're waiting for the MSBA interest statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3283.405s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're hoping to get that, but I think what a lot of people want to do is just have a discussion, start talking about things, and putting together a plan, and then prioritizing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3295.197s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I do know that currently some of the CTE programs are currently reconfiguring to their new spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3302.92s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it would be nice to even, you know, share some of those stories and we can bring it back to the regular committee and just tell everybody what's going on in those, you know, those areas that are reconfiguring and what the status is in progress and maybe something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3319.107s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we could have like a Google document where we could, you know, have a timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3323.969s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3325.302s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, this is where we want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3327.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is when we get the MSBA statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3329.924s">[Kreatz]</a>: Here's the five-year capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3331.305s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's like a lot of planning involved, so it would be a lot of like mini-meetings to just track the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3336.247s">[Kreatz]</a>: But yeah, so that's about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3338.028s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6028.274s">[Kreatz]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6030.256s">[Kreatz]</a>: So the questions I had, you had already answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6032.518s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was the copy paper and the textbooks and the supplies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6037.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had all the same questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6039.106s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did have one more, and I know we talked about this last year, and I know it's really early on, but I think, Michael, you might have mentioned this, that we wanted to go for an observation day, and maybe sit, I know it's very early on, it's just they're still getting set up and established, but I would really love to go and be invited to the class, and just for the day, without interrupting the instruction, but just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6061.479s">[Kreatz]</a>: participate with the students, if that's something that would be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5805.445s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5806.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5808.087s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have one question, and I think Paulette maybe touched on some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5812.269s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I just wanted to know, so can the LexiaCore be used for the upper grades if somebody's struggling or develops dyslexia in middle school or high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5823.077s">[Kreatz]</a>: And will they get the intervention that they need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5826.099s">[Kreatz]</a>: Just checking on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5826.899s">[Kreatz]</a>: So LexiaCore 5 does go beyond second grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5829.621s">[Kreatz]</a>: So yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5830.461s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5831.322s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I know that a parent, I received a message who mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5834.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: we think that the Dibles 8 did cover the upper grades, Lexia Core will cover those students as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=374.501s">[Kreatz]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=375.382s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have a question, and I'm familiar with the report and the reimbursement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=382.824s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to explain to the new committee members, and maybe, Christine, if you could explain, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=388.186s">[Kreatz]</a>: Patterson, how a teacher or administrator submits a reimbursement, like what's required in order for them to get reimbursed, and do they get full reimbursement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=946.338s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1527.589s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I have to disclose that my sister works as an assistant group leader in the after school program and I already completed a disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest form and I submitted it with the city clerk's office last Thursday so I could speak this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1546.741s">[Kreatz]</a>: After learning, immediately after the school committee meeting in November, I heard from some students and they had told me that they were still making the minimum wage, which was the $11 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1559.827s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was a little confused because I thought that everybody was making above that, which was between the 12 and then going up to the 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1567.77s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I had sent a message off to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1570.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: assistant superintendent's office, and she was, sorry, assistant superintendent of finance, and she was going to look into, let's see, look into an option and explore a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1584.741s">[Kreatz]</a>: that we can increase it in the budget level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1588.103s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to say that I really appreciate everything that you do in the after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1593.828s">[Kreatz]</a>: I volunteered at the Brooks, the Roberts, and I've been to the McGlynn after school programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1598.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I've observed and participated and helped out in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1602.674s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's very well structured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1604.135s">[Kreatz]</a>: There's a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1605.476s">[Kreatz]</a>: It starts off with physical education, either inside or outside, then everybody goes back indoors and they're doing either story time in the younger groups, arts and crafts activities, then there's homework time, and then there's some free time, and I've spent the afternoon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1624.415s">[Kreatz]</a>: until it's pickup time with the classrooms that I've been in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1629.1s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just been a wonderful experience for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1631.723s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I've seen and see exactly what you do on the floor and in the schools working with the students and how they look up to you as role models and how they really appreciate everything that you're doing and just that you're a student working with another student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1647.259s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's just wonderful seeing everything that you're doing in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1651.526s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you and I am very proud of everything that you do in the program and for coming out here tonight and advocating for the after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1660.419s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4013.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4015.07s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4016.572s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to report out an update about the community fund grant checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4022.797s">[Kreatz]</a>: This morning I received an email from Aleesha Nunley, Finance Director Auditor, and the Chief of Staff in the Mayor's Office, Dave Rodriguez, is working on a communications to update everybody about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4036.035s">[Kreatz]</a>: grant checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4037.836s">[Kreatz]</a>: Under the guidance of the Department of Revenue, they're working on a mechanism to fund the awards from the casino to the individual recipients.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4047.44s">[Kreatz]</a>: Since the casino just opened last summer, this is the first time the city has made awards based on the surrounding community agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4056.085s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we want to do this in a legal and in transparent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4061.547s">[Kreatz]</a>: So if everybody, we really appreciate your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4065.814s">[Kreatz]</a>: your continued patience and hopefully we'll see an update either on the website or maybe by email sometime this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4074.616s">[Kreatz]</a>: Just wanted to share that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4077.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4236.209s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to say, you know, thank you for bringing this report and thank you for coming out and explaining that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4242.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did, and the superintendent answered already, I did have a question like who was going to be competing and she explained it was like the various different programs, the automotive and the, I forget where my list went, but so that answered my other question and I just want to wish the students good luck and I hope to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4262.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: and hear back from you after the competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4265.665s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4266.105s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4268.327s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4268.867s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've never been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4463.615s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4464.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4465.696s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know, so the state-of-the-art fire alarm control panel, so does that, like, are the students going to be learning, like, you know, where they can detect where a fire might be or, yeah, that's what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4477.7s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, like, it will, like, identify, like, where, like, the location of the fire and then pin it off to the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4525.219s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep, and that's just, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4527.68s">[Kreatz]</a>: And thank you very much to the Nadon electrical support and for their support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4533.043s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, it is incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4534.904s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just thought it was incredible myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4537.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: And what does the data rack do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4540.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, is that like a, like I'm not sure what that is either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4609.78s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4610.543s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4611.305s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4617.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, I just I really didn't know and I didn't Google because I thought I would ask and find out from the experts Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4728.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4729.937s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to know now, can this award be used for anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4734.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are there any plans for the award, what they're going to use it for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4738.339s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did look through it, and I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4740.02s">[Kreatz]</a>: It says something in math and science for higher education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4744.581s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I wasn't sure if it was going to a certain department, or was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4918.512s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4919.312s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just had a quick question because I know this question comes up a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4923.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: What is the difference between a long-term substitute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4926.661s">[Kreatz]</a>: a daily sub and a per diem sub.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4929.262s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm just curious, even at my own work where I work at MTRS, it comes up a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4934.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: And each school district has a different definition for what it is in their school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4940.267s">[Kreatz]</a>: Some require DESE certification for long-term subs, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4945.69s">[Kreatz]</a>: The same for per diem and daily subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4948.211s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was just wondering what Medford's definition was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4952.453s">[Kreatz]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5011.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I just had one question, because some of the locations were listed as male, like for example, like M-A-I-L for the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5021.578s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I was just wondering, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5023.499s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was really just miscellaneous throughout the spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6096.361s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6097.482s">[Kreatz]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6097.902s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Vicazelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6099.083s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6099.824s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say, you know, I noticed last year the feedback we got was we didn't communicate, you know, timely, early, and I'm happy to see that we're getting this information out, all the dates out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6110.825s">[Kreatz]</a>: so early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6111.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's only beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6113.306s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6114.686s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6117.647s">[Kreatz]</a>: I have just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6119.188s">[Kreatz]</a>: Two are really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6120.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are the open houses going to have the student-led tours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6123.81s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know they had them last year where the students also participated in the tours along with the teachers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6131.472s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that was something that I think a lot of the students really appreciated seeing and meeting other students that are in the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6190.234s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6192.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then these are kind of fun questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6194.979s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to know, last year we had the middle school barbecue in the summer and it was a great, I thought it was a great success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6202.886s">[Kreatz]</a>: I went, I helped serve, and Peter, he did a lot of burgers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6208.311s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if that was maybe in the plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6210.914s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know it's early, but if we were planning to do something like that again this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6236.172s">[Kreatz]</a>: Great, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6237.413s">[Kreatz]</a>: And keep us up to date, because I know a lot of us want to help out and volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6255.097s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are you all set, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6256.118s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6257.498s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if the auditing company was going to be doing anything differently to ensure the equitable number of students from each elementary school assigned to the two middle schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6273.708s">[Kreatz]</a>: I've heard that one school didn't have a lot of students in that middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6278.271s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that was still a little bit fuzzy last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6282.313s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I was just wondering if there was any plan to do anything a little bit differently to balance it out a little bit better or... So the plan is to do the process similar to what we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1594.593s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1596.414s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I want to say thank you to the committee for putting these instructions together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1600.496s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did have just a couple of really simple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1604.678s">[Kreatz]</a>: So do we follow these same procedures to add subcommittee meeting minutes to the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1610.401s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because I know quite often we have to send a request to add our meeting minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1614.803s">[Kreatz]</a>: Would we follow the same procedure, I'm assuming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1617.865s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1946.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1947.265s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I just had just a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1950.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I just wanted to know, when we send it in the subject, should we put specifically, please add to agenda, you know, something that will stand out that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1960.595s">[Kreatz]</a>: will be unique for people adding to the agenda so that the superintendent and the mayor know that, oh, this is an item for the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1969.36s">[Kreatz]</a>: I should make that a priority over some other emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1972.041s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1973.402s">[Kreatz]</a>: That was just my thought at my work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1974.682s">[Kreatz]</a>: We have certain subject procedures when emailing, but that was just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1979.725s">[Kreatz]</a>: And also, I wanted to know, who is the designee while we wait for a replacement for the executive assistant, which is just recently developed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1990.394s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1991.534s">[Kreatz]</a>: McLaughlin has mentioned this a couple of times with some other procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1995.295s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are we going to put these procedures on the websites once they're approved so that we can easily access them for reference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2001.757s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, because like, I mean, I think we come across one of the documents which is functions of the school committee and I had the final version, but you know how like there's multiple versions everywhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2011.579s">[Kreatz]</a>: Where is the final one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2012.859s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, so I was just wondering where will this be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2015.5s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2086.424s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess I did want to know, you know, who, like, who should we be, like, just to, you know, to start the process, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2093.51s">[Kreatz]</a>: Going forward, we have to schedule some meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2095.89s">[Kreatz]</a>: So am I going to send it to the mayor, the superintendent, and who else while we wait for a replacement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2101.891s">[Kreatz]</a>: Is it going to go to Pete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2108.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, so the mayor and superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2110.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: Mayor and superintendent, chair and superintendent, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2112.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2112.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2115.454s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it doesn't matter, just put anything in the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2118.474s">[Kreatz]</a>: Agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2119.715s">[Kreatz]</a>: OK, agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2121.395s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2437.426s">[Kreatz]</a>: To extend it to three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3379.676s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3380.798s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for your years of service, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3383.161s">[Kreatz]</a>: Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3383.982s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's very much appreciated and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3386.947s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5620.47s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I wanted to say thank you Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5622.391s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ray and Dr. Sabe for being here and thank you for the frequently asked questions to the mayor's office and last Friday's bulletin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5630.339s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was excellent and I found it so useful and some of my questions were answered and I really appreciate it and I know there's a lot of people out there that are, you know, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5640.669s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, concerned, anxious, worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5643.87s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can they get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5644.911s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, it's just there's a lot to think about every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5648.792s">[Kreatz]</a>: We're getting the reports and just it's updating all day long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5652.793s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's all we hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5654.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it can be a little nerve wracking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5656.094s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I really appreciate everything that everybody's doing to keep us updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5660.276s">[Kreatz]</a>: Also something that we want to think about is the methods of communicating if we have to cancel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5666.258s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if schools have to dismiss, I did hear of some schools that had to dismiss at the last minute because a parent had come into the school and was tested positive and they had to get in touch with everybody to send the students home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5681.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I don't think we've ever had to do that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5684.193s">[Kreatz]</a>: So there's a lot to think about and consider in the planning stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5688.897s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I appreciate everything that everybody's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5691.559s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's really a tremendous amount of work everybody's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5693.801s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5694.871s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5695.231s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5696.192s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5720.194s">[Kreatz]</a>: last couple of years we've been going back to school three days in August and this year we're not and I was just wondering if that's going to be the start of a new trend if we're gonna you know kind of we're not going to go back in August anymore or did that just happen with the calendar this year I wasn't sure so it's just I just happen to notice so I just thought I would ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5894.554s">[Kreatz]</a>: to all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5895.495s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean especially like 36 seniors and you know it's senior year and it's just so unfortunate with the coronavirus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5903.94s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I understand it's very disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5907.641s">[Kreatz]</a>: And at the same time, I'm torn because I just want to make sure that the students, their safety and well-being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5914.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's a really tough situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5917.444s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I really feel for you and all the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5920.705s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I hope that there's something that maybe another way or an event that we can do here to celebrate maybe not going to France, but just doing a nice cultural event here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5933.413s">[Kreatz]</a>: I mean, it wouldn't really make it better, but just something that we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5939.014s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to express how this is very sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5942.635s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I did hear from some parents, it's very disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5945.836s">[Kreatz]</a>: But they understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5947.316s">[Kreatz]</a>: And they understand that it's a risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5949.896s">[Kreatz]</a>: And they don't want to kind of put their student, their child in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5953.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's a really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5955.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I'm sorry that we have to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5961.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=646.624s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=676.203s">[Kreatz]</a>: The parent is just concerned that it's going to be counted as a not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=682.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just want to get that on the record that it's not a requirement and if they don't want to go on the Zoom call, it's not going to hurt their grade for pass or fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=694.255s">[Kreatz]</a>: So could somebody please clarify that for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=696.636s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=724.498s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=725.182s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=726.343s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, and I just wanted to share, um, or, you know, my concern regarding, and I know you don't have the numbers just yet, but, um, in terms of how many families haven't been connected with, and, um, last week I had a conversation with, uh, Dr. Cushing, um, and I shared an idea that I had, um, that maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=748.772s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we're still having trouble reaching out to these families, we could have the school resource officer, or maybe the police department, do a wellness check with these families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=759.978s">[Kreatz]</a>: Because you know, how do we know they even have any of the communication that we're giving to everybody I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=766.181s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, I'm a little concerned and worried for those families because if we haven't heard from them, we don't know what they know and what they don't know regarding the distance learning and what we're doing regarding the pass or fail or just any of the communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=779.649s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, you know, I just wanted to just share my idea and, you know, just put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=784.672s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1205.911s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to say a couple of words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.633s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1210.874s">[Kreatz]</a>: Patterson, I want to say thank you very much for your service over the last couple of years in such a short amount of time you have accomplished so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1218.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: You were a great help to me when I was signing the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1221.98s">[Kreatz]</a>: In fact, you came down and met me at city hall and showed me what to do and answered any questions I had about the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1230.805s">[Kreatz]</a>: You've just done an incredible job balancing the budget and beginning the process to change the scheduling of the budget, which we started last year, which was extremely efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1244.769s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we were able to have the meetings more regularly to discuss them in smaller group sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1250.47s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just really appreciate everything you've done and I wish you well in your new endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1254.531s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2356.093s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2357.314s">[Kreatz]</a>: So my question might be similar to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2359.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham's question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2359.876s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had a very, I mean, I think it might be the same exact question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2364.96s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2366.519s">[Kreatz]</a>: How will the costs associated with some of the repairs that we discussed in the building and ground subcommittee last Wednesday, you know, we talked about the generator at the high school, the hot water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2380.473s">[Kreatz]</a>: I see the transformer is listed in this budget and the Curtis Tufts hot water system or boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2391.467s">[Kreatz]</a>: I think you mentioned at the beginning, I was just trying to type everything down really fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2395.91s">[Kreatz]</a>: How will those costs be paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2465.802s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2466.423s">[Kreatz]</a>: And when do you think we'll get the appropriation from the municipal government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2471.266s">[Kreatz]</a>: I guess in the past,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2473.416s">[Kreatz]</a>: And maybe I'm wrong, but I think in the past, we typically had the appropriation, like when we went into the final budget meeting, like we knew what we got for a number, but I could be just not remembering it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2521.468s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2658.752s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2659.232s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I said one follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2660.253s">[Kreatz]</a>: So do you think it would be two weeks, three weeks, like where, you know, I'm just curious, like, I mean, you know, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2668.656s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I guess we'll just be waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2740.857s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1159.869s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1160.33s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1165.431s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you so much for everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1167.532s">[Kreatz]</a>: You've been so wonderful to all the students, the staff, the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1172.854s">[Kreatz]</a>: You're just a wonderful, amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1174.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wish you the very best in retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1176.255s">[Kreatz]</a>: The very best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1177.356s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4475.188s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4476.008s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4477.068s">[Kreatz]</a>: I wanted to thank personally thank the advisory committee for all their hard work in volunteerism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4483.552s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, you spend, you know, hours just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4486.246s">[Kreatz]</a>: sorting through all the information and we really appreciate everything you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4490.907s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do have a question or just something I wanted to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4493.908s">[Kreatz]</a>: I was, over the weekend, somebody shared with me that one of the names is Mr. Duck, and I guess there's a proposed bill that is, you know, coming out where the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4509.894s">[Kreatz]</a>: is going to promulgate regulations to ensure that no public school uses athletic name, logo, or mascot, which names refer to or associated with Native Americans, including Native American cultures and specific Native American tribes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4528.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not sure where this bill is right now, but I just wanted to mention it where if this is gonna be coming a regulation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4539.315s">[Kreatz]</a>: that you know possibly in the near future if we were to choose a name like that we might have to have another renaming committee in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4549.238s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4551.538s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11867.15s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11868.19s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just want to thank everybody who came out tonight and spoke at the podium or on Zoom and the emails that were sent in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11876.333s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I, you know, first off, all of the choices were excellent and deserving of being the name on a school building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11883.926s">[Kreatz]</a>: I am in favor of Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11887.75s">[Kreatz]</a>: She served as an educator over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11890.712s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm one of eight myself, and I had the privilege to have her as one of my teachers at the Waite School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11896.517s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was a neighborhood school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11897.958s">[Kreatz]</a>: She was a genuine, dedicated teacher, truly outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11901.361s">[Kreatz]</a>: My siblings and friends, we would go by to visit her after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11905.205s">[Kreatz]</a>: She lived in the neighborhood, and we always wanted to go see Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11908.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: Barry, and she's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11909.206s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, be planting outside or taking care of our grass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11912.068s">[Kreatz]</a>: And we'd always say, hi, Miss Barry, and, you know, wave along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11916.171s">[Kreatz]</a>: She would stay after school and help with anything that we were struggling with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11920.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had difficulty with reading and she would stay after with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11923.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, when she did pass away, I'm part of the Waite School Facebook group, and so many stories were shared about her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11933.144s">[Kreatz]</a>: And it's just, you know, everything that was said tonight is all factual, historical,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11939.5s">[Kreatz]</a>: I still remember going to the Wade School, walking with the neighborhood friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11944.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: We just all walked together down the Wade School path to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11949.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, the Medford School is in a better place because of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11951.365s">[Kreatz]</a>: Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11952.486s">[Kreatz]</a>: We have a unique opportunity to honor an educator and pay respect, especially to a person who walked and led in the school that we're renaming right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11965.046s">[Kreatz]</a>: She was a great leader, honoring Jean would also honor all the educators that rose to the many challenges of the unknown during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11973.513s">[Kreatz]</a>: And there's no one more deserving of renaming the school after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11977.817s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's my thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11979.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just wanted to share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11982.32s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11982.781s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I don't want to clap either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11984.222s">[Kreatz]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11985.523s">[Kreatz]</a>: So please, no claps or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11987.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11988.225s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12682.388s">[Kreatz]</a>: Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12768.045s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13813.622s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I've had the light on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13815.204s">[Kreatz]</a>: I just have questions about each of the policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13819.648s">[Kreatz]</a>: First, I'm going to start with the calendar policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13824.573s">[Kreatz]</a>: I did watch the meeting on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13827.516s">[Kreatz]</a>: I watched it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13829.841s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, I tried to follow it the best I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13832.882s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just have concerns about adding three additional no school days to the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13840.184s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, last week we had, you know, the high heat temperature days and I was getting messages from parents saying that I'm not sending my child to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13850.588s">[Kreatz]</a>: It's too hot to be in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13852.869s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, this is going to be, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13856.75s">[Kreatz]</a>: happening if we're going to having the kids go to school to June 28 June 30th it they're going to be going in the hot hot temperatures adding three more no school days onto the calendar and with all the snow days I mean we don't know in New England it's unpredictable with what the snow days are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13876.917s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do recall one year that my son went to school until June 29th because there were so many snow days and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13884.18s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was really difficult for the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13886.522s">[Kreatz]</a>: And in fact, the students were done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13889.223s">[Kreatz]</a>: They didn't wanna go and some families just went off on their vacations and didn't finish the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13897.428s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like to have an opportunity to see what other school districts in the greater Boston area are doing or in our neighboring area to know what the implication is of adding the three additional no school days to the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13910.115s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I would like that information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13912.157s">[Kreatz]</a>: before I was going to make a vote on adding those calendar days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13917.147s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's what, you know, that's what I have for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13920.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: I don't know if you want me to go on with the public comment and then I have for the agenda, I have some questions or thoughts for the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13927.533s">[Kreatz]</a>: Do you have an answer to that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13929.354s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14115.913s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'll think about that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14117.794s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then in regards to the public comment, so- Mayor, excuse me, could we just discuss one policy at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15330.994s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes I have my light on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15333.236s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yep so I am you know I was just I guess I'm just having trouble like I feel like the public comment part and the agenda kind of go together and you know I'm just and I I tried watching the meeting I'm just I'm just a little bit confused because if I look at our current agenda we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15356.855s">[Kreatz]</a>: On our current agenda, currently what we have in this part of the policy, we have community participation, where it does say any citizen may be given permission to speak at the school committee meetings on any agenda item up to three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15372.162s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's always been on our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15375.684s">[Kreatz]</a>: Then we have the public participation emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15379.405s">[Kreatz]</a>: So is this new policy public comment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15386.008s">[Kreatz]</a>: is that replacing community participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15391.169s">[Kreatz]</a>: You just changed the name of the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15392.93s">[Kreatz]</a>: Instead of saying community participation, it's now gonna be called public comment, but it's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15401.472s">[Kreatz]</a>: That's where I'm just unsure about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15535.893s">[Kreatz]</a>: It does, like it sounds like you're separating it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15538.334s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so I guess I just want some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15542.416s">[Kreatz]</a>: So can a resident,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15545.711s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, come, you know, before the podium at any point and just speak about something that's not on the agenda or... That's against the law, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15554.693s">[Kreatz]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15555.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that... Because that... It doesn't... In the new policy, it doesn't state any item... Okay, it does state any item on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15564.795s">[Kreatz]</a>: All right, the only other concern I had was... And I heard this before, a couple of meetings back, was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15573.675s">[Kreatz]</a>: We asked for the full Medford Street address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15577.757s">[Kreatz]</a>: And so the concern is that what if a community member is displaced for whatever reason, whether they're homeless or in foster care, and they don't have a Medford resident address, you know, we specifically, you know, states that it must be a Medford Street address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15598.488s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that was something that was brought to my attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15602.591s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, a while back and I know you were working on these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15750.73s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, I would appreciate that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15991.032s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.529s">[Kreatz]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.809s">[Kreatz]</a>: Van der Kloot and myself, we have a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15998.591s">[Kreatz]</a>: We haven't got to that point yet on the agenda to have the meeting start at a scheduled time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16007.138s">[Kreatz]</a>: We heard from community members, all of us, that they would like a designated time to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16015.345s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I know that what I've heard from the discussion was that you, during your subcommittee meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16025.029s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, kind of talking about, you know, having the possibility of having a meeting start, you know, maybe five, six flexible with the superintendent, and I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16035.875s">[Kreatz]</a>: However, what we've heard from the community is that, you know, I know that some of the reports that are presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16045.931s">[Kreatz]</a>: might be for us, but some of the community, you know, enjoys, you know, being part of that, you know, discussion and hearing it and, you know, has kind of asked us to have the meeting start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16058.419s">[Kreatz]</a>: At seven, which, you know, I tried to kind of go somewhere in the middle between six and seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16063.142s">[Kreatz]</a>: And, you know, I just kind of came up with the middle time of 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16067.064s">[Kreatz]</a>: We've started a couple of our meetings at 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16070.705s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I do the goal of all of our meetings is to not have them go, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16078.393s">[Kreatz]</a>: hours and hours, you know, that's definitely a goal and I know that that's what this plan is, you know, trying to do is trying to, you know, reduce the amount of time that our meetings are going by having a, you know, a consolidated agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16095.051s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16097.751s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just concerned where now, you know, we're going to have, which, and I'm totally in support of not having the presentations for the public until at, you know, after 7pm or after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16111.603s">[Kreatz]</a>: I do agree with that so that people who are in work can go home, eat, you know, eat their dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16117.708s">[Kreatz]</a>: And then if they want to either join on Zoom or they're going to come down to the chamber, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16124.193s">[Kreatz]</a>: So that's where I am with that because where I didn't, you know, I heard about your, um, I read, I'm sorry, not read, watched on YouTube after I had already done my resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16138.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16139.642s">[Kreatz]</a>: So it just was like, you know, the timing was like a coincidence, you know, I'm doing the resolution, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16144.745s">[Kreatz]</a>: Bandicoot, and then you were having a discussion, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16148.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, um, so, you know, I'm just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16152.469s">[Kreatz]</a>: You know, I am definitely I start work very early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16155.493s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know the administration does I know the teachers do and, you know, this is like my I don't know like 20th hour right now I'm losing my voice I can't think I'm, I have no voice you know it's just going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16167.687s">[Kreatz]</a>: So, I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16169.349s">[Kreatz]</a>: and definitely in support of having earlier meetings but at the same time you know it's our duty to serve the public and and that's what has been pointed out to me by you know some of the public that you know we used to do our meetings at seven we every meeting started at seven and then once we had the pandemic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16190.984s">[Kreatz]</a>: we did kind of cut the, I mean, we started our meetings earlier because we were meeting earlier, but we went just as late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16201.066s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like we started, some of our meetings started last year at four, but we still met until 11 o'clock at night, you know, even though we, so we, we, we started to trend towards an earlier hour, you know, so I'm wondering if, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16217.955s">[Kreatz]</a>: if maybe, like, if we could come up with a set time so that the community knows that we're going to be starting our meetings at a set time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16225.181s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm not gonna, you know, my resolution hasn't come up yet, so that's, you know, coming up in the future time, but we are talking about the gender at this time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16235.048s">[Kreatz]</a>: So from reading this, I'm not sure, like, what time are the meetings gonna start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16240.152s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm just curious myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16241.273s">[Kreatz]</a>: Are they, you know, it doesn't seem like it's going to be set here for a specific time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16822.898s">[Kreatz]</a>: and try it and see how the public feels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.063s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm gonna have to abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.983s">[Kreatz]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just not ready to do the vote right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17486.284s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17487.861s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent, for the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17491.123s">[Kreatz]</a>: I make a motion to go ahead with signed option two for the front entrance of Medford High School to be put up for September 1st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17500.25s">[Kreatz]</a>: This is the same sign option that was preferred choice at the subcommittee meeting that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17505.293s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was just labeled number six during the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17508.235s">[Kreatz]</a>: We just had more choices, but that was the preferred choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18403.458s">[Kreatz]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19106.737s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, I would like to get the funding to find out what the cost would be before I make the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19113.822s">[Kreatz]</a>: Can we table this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6020.484s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6021.605s">[Kreatz]</a>: I want to thank both students for coming out this evening and speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6025.927s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6026.988s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I just had a question because I've been seeing some chatter on Facebook about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6032.97s">[Kreatz]</a>: whether or not we still have a school resource officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6035.851s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to maybe clear up some confusion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6041.113s">[Kreatz]</a>: Would you be able to help answer that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1144.09s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes, yes, I want to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1146.256s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1146.878s">[Kreatz]</a>: And last year I got to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1149.154s">[Kreatz]</a>: go to the live open house and see some of the updated programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1152.597s">[Kreatz]</a>: They look fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1154.038s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I just wanted to know if you would briefly be able to describe what the mass core framework is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1161.243s">[Kreatz]</a>: I know I got it described in an email and I just thought it was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1165.106s">[Kreatz]</a>: And if you were able to share it, if you could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1168.788s">[Kreatz]</a>: So mass core?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1169.809s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1181.25s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1229.651s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1231.653s">[Kreatz]</a>: And do you know when the fall advisory meeting is going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1236.237s">[Kreatz]</a>: Like, is there going to be, like, in the fall advisory meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1242.823s">[Kreatz]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1244.084s">[Kreatz]</a>: And one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1246.146s">[Kreatz]</a>: When my son was at the vocational as a student,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1249.697s">[Kreatz]</a>: Um, there was some limitations with the scheduling, um, with extracurriculars in world language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1255.919s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I was just wondering, um, if, if that's going to be something that might be worked on into the schedules where, um, those opportunities might be more available for the students, for the CTE students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1266.721s">[Kreatz]</a>: If we can get a new master schedule, that's the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1269.202s">[Kreatz]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1269.522s">[Kreatz]</a>: And that's what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1270.762s">[Kreatz]</a>: I had received some information in an email, but I just wanted to kind of just put that out there that that's something that I believe the district, the administration's working on to try and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1279.847s">[Kreatz]</a>: get the schedule and get that in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1483.637s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1484.237s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2296.227s">[Kreatz]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2300.491s">[Kreatz]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2300.832s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2301.953s">[Kreatz]</a>: And I had a similar question that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2304.075s">[Kreatz]</a>: Graham had, was how do interested community members<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2307.674s">[Kreatz]</a>: you know, find out about opportunities and you've already answered it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2310.336s">[Kreatz]</a>: So I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2311.436s">[Kreatz]</a>: It was easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2313.217s">[Kreatz]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
