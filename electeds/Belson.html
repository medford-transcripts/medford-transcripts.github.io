    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=282.612s">[Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=283.713s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=287.476s">[Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=296.364s">[Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=307.756s">[Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=326.922s">[Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=333.386s">[Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=342.453s">[Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=346.656s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=349.718s">[Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=351.84s">[Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=354.522s">[Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=361.0s">[Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=375.523s">[Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=379.743s">[Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=385.865s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=389.462s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=407.105s">[Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=417.583s">[Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=421.364s">[Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=426.426s">[Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=428.846s">[Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=439.282s">[Belson]</a>: The pertinent questions are these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=441.484s">[Belson]</a>: Is it true that we're in a deficit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=444.327s">[Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=448.351s">[Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives available to meet our needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=453.275s">[Belson]</a>: Is this a one-time request or will there be another one, a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=458.641s">[Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=461.143s">[Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=464.925s">[Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=469.048s">[Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=475.411s">[Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=480.294s">[Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=487.098s">[Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=490.661s">[Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=501.566s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=508.629s">[Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=511.211s">[Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=519.264s">[Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=529.65s">[Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=532.472s">[Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=539.336s">[Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=547.372s">[Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=555.777s">[Belson]</a>: The school administration, by law, is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=567.505s">[Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=570.066s">[Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=577.699s">[Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=582.52s">[Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=585.601s">[Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=594.262s">[Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=603.624s">[Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=607.899s">[Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=613.901s">[Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=616.862s">[Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, did they fail to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=628.505s">[Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=630.625s">[Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=636.987s">[Belson]</a>: a need for an override, because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=650.471s">[Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=653.532s">[Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=657.253s">[Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office, and the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=666.367s">[Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=670.109s">[Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=672.29s">[Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=675.752s">[Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=679.054s">[Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=681.915s">[Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=684.456s">[Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=691.555s">[Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=699.622s">[Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=716.396s">[Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=719.837s">[Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=730.519s">[Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=736.041s">[Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=740.202s">[Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=743.037s">[Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=744.938s">[Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=749.439s">[Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=750.499s">[Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=756.661s">[Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=762.723s">[Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=771.63s">[Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=779.235s">[Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=781.797s">[Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=783.118s">[Belson]</a>: They're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=785.14s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=791.484s">[Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're going to reassess it and the taxes are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=797.668s">[Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably going to pay a little bit more for water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=801.897s">[Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=808.981s">[Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=823.449s">[Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=826.01s">[Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=829.392s">[Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=832.377s">[Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=838.761s">[Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=841.222s">[Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=847.225s">[Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=851.928s">[Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=855.029s">[Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=859.172s">[Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=861.998s">[Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=863.659s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=871.201s">[Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=876.803s">[Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=880.745s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=883.466s">[Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=888.868s">[Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=895.27s">[Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in a planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=909.073s">[Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=912.594s">[Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=921.137s">[Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=924.223s">[Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=931.405s">[Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=936.307s">[Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=937.887s">[Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=941.649s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=953.59s">[Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=959.114s">[Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=960.454s">[Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=974.183s">[Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=979.127s">[Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=983.07s">[Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=985.071s">[Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=994.398s">[Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1004.286s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1009.601s">[Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1015.144s">[Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1018.386s">[Belson]</a>: You're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1020.307s">[Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1022.969s">[Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1031.054s">[Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1037.822s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them, and we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1046.565s">[Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want, and no school system is able to do that, and no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1053.387s">[Belson]</a>: Well, let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1057.268s">[Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1063.243s">[Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1065.745s">[Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1067.706s">[Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1068.407s">[Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1071.049s">[Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1089.605s">[Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996, and I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1095.851s">[Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1105.039s">[Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville 23958, we just built a building so you can see where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1117.277s">[Belson]</a>: that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1118.237s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you want to chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1121.418s">[Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1128.841s">[Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1130.521s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1141.867s">[Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1153.233s">[Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1155.594s">[Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1159.476s">[Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1161.877s">[Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1169.025s">[Belson]</a>: So, then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.008s">[Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.809s">[Belson]</a>: Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1173.329s">[Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1178.534s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1180.095s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, you know, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1188.863s">[Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1189.704s">[Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1194.743s">[Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're going to make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1205.067s">[Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1207.668s">[Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1208.829s">[Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.469s">[Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.97s">[Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1210.41s">[Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1211.31s">[Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, the charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1212.751s">[Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1214.612s">[Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1234.497s">[Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1243.9s">[Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1247.302s">[Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1249.282s">[Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1255.545s">[Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1260.467s">[Belson]</a>: Because our benefits are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1262.848s">[Belson]</a>: They're very good, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1264.951s">[Belson]</a>: and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1268.554s">[Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1271.957s">[Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1277.541s">[Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1280.864s">[Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1287.609s">[Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1291.272s">[Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1294.546s">[Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1299.851s">[Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1308.519s">[Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1311.822s">[Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1316.286s">[Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1317.707s">[Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1319.794s">[Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1327.776s">[Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1330.537s">[Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1333.138s">[Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1342.641s">[Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1344.181s">[Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1346.562s">[Belson]</a>: are voting against it, need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1351.063s">[Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1359.125s">[Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1362.465s">[Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1366.526s">[Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting or are going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1372.627s">[Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, so the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1377.037s">[Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1381.341s">[Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1384.484s">[Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election for the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1396.034s">[Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1402.62s">[Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1405.463s">[Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1406.844s">[Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1411.348s">[Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1419.782s">[Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1437.034s">[Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1442.317s">[Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1450.399s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1455.32s">[Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1458.961s">[Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1463.782s">[Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1473.164s">[Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1479.157s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1483.4s">[Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1487.303s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1488.504s">[Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1499.272s">[Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1501.533s">[Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1505.135s">[Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1506.456s">[Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1509.939s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1521.367s">[Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1526.847s">[Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1528.127s">[Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1533.67s">[Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1539.992s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1548.515s">[Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1552.417s">[Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1557.808s">[Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1559.949s">[Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1566.531s">[Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1580.615s">[Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1584.376s">[Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1586.321s">[Belson]</a>: the big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1588.963s">[Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1590.024s">[Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1593.706s">[Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1596.068s">[Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1600.711s">[Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1604.774s">[Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1607.715s">[Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1609.816s">[Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1613.497s">[Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1617.978s">[Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1621.559s">[Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1626.121s">[Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1629.542s">[Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1631.403s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=139.648s">[Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=140.709s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=144.473s">[Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=153.361s">[Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=164.764s">[Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=183.921s">[Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=190.39s">[Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=199.456s">[Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=203.659s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=206.541s">[Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=208.843s">[Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=211.525s">[Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=218.007s">[Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=232.533s">[Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=236.755s">[Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=242.858s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=246.465s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=264.116s">[Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=274.585s">[Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=278.367s">[Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=283.43s">[Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=285.851s">[Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=296.438s">[Belson]</a>: Pertinent questions are these is it true that it's we're in a deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=301.323s">[Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=305.367s">[Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=307.95s">[Belson]</a>: available to meet our needs Is this a one-time request or will there be another one a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=315.637s">[Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=318.154s">[Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=321.916s">[Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=326.059s">[Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=332.402s">[Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=337.305s">[Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=344.089s">[Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=347.659s">[Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=358.566s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=365.631s">[Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=368.213s">[Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=376.28s">[Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=386.666s">[Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=389.488s">[Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=396.332s">[Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=404.38s">[Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=412.783s">[Belson]</a>: The school administration by law is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=424.508s">[Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=427.049s">[Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=434.704s">[Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=439.526s">[Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=442.607s">[Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=451.27s">[Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=460.613s">[Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=464.897s">[Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=470.899s">[Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=473.88s">[Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, that they failed to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=485.524s">[Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=487.625s">[Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=493.993s">[Belson]</a>: a need for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=496.354s">[Belson]</a>: Because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=507.476s">[Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=510.536s">[Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=514.257s">[Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=517.278s">[Belson]</a>: And the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=523.359s">[Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=527.122s">[Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=529.284s">[Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=532.747s">[Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=536.07s">[Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=538.912s">[Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=541.474s">[Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=548.541s">[Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=558.846s">[Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=573.392s">[Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=576.837s">[Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=587.52s">[Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=593.042s">[Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=597.204s">[Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=600.043s">[Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=601.945s">[Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=606.448s">[Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=607.509s">[Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=613.674s">[Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=619.739s">[Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=628.635s">[Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=636.238s">[Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=638.779s">[Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now, they're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=642.14s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=648.483s">[Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're gonna reassess it and the taxes are gonna go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=654.666s">[Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably gonna pay a little bit more for water and sewer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=658.902s">[Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=665.966s">[Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=680.454s">[Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=683.015s">[Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=686.397s">[Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=689.38s">[Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=695.762s">[Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=698.223s">[Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=704.225s">[Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=708.926s">[Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=712.027s">[Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=716.168s">[Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=719.011s">[Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=720.651s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=728.213s">[Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=733.594s">[Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=737.755s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=740.455s">[Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=745.856s">[Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=752.264s">[Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in the planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=766.092s">[Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=769.614s">[Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=778.159s">[Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=781.215s">[Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=788.401s">[Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=793.305s">[Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=794.886s">[Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=798.669s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=810.592s">[Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=816.113s">[Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=817.453s">[Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=831.176s">[Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=836.117s">[Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=840.08s">[Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=842.061s">[Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment, over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=856.052s">[Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=861.296s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=866.601s">[Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=872.144s">[Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up, you're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=877.327s">[Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=879.968s">[Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=888.053s">[Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=894.815s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=901.037s">[Belson]</a>: And we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=903.558s">[Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=906.178s">[Belson]</a>: And no school system is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=908.059s">[Belson]</a>: And no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=910.38s">[Belson]</a>: But let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=914.281s">[Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=920.242s">[Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.552s">[Belson]</a>: is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.732s">[Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=924.712s">[Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=925.413s">[Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=927.273s">[Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=928.373s">[Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=929.013s">[Belson]</a>: And I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=952.85s">[Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=964.499s">[Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville, 23,958, we just built a building so you can see where that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=975.248s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you wanna chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=981.033s">[Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=985.836s">[Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=987.517s">[Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=996.141s">[Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1008.436s">[Belson]</a>: of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1010.237s">[Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1012.578s">[Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1016.479s">[Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1018.86s">[Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1026.023s">[Belson]</a>: So then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.024s">[Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.825s">[Belson]</a>: Charlene, the room boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1031.265s">[Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1035.527s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1037.085s">[Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1045.854s">[Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1046.694s">[Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1047.595s">[Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're gonna make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1062.065s">[Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1064.685s">[Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1065.786s">[Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.166s">[Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.866s">[Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1067.406s">[Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1068.326s">[Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, their charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1069.746s">[Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1071.447s">[Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1091.502s">[Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1100.887s">[Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1104.309s">[Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1106.29s">[Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1112.553s">[Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us, because our benefits are good,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1120.069s">[Belson]</a>: very good, by the way, and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1125.551s">[Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1129.652s">[Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1134.534s">[Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1137.855s">[Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1144.617s">[Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1148.254s">[Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1151.515s">[Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1156.836s">[Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1165.518s">[Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1168.799s">[Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1173.28s">[Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1174.7s">[Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1176.806s">[Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1184.77s">[Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1187.532s">[Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1190.153s">[Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1199.658s">[Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1201.199s">[Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1203.579s">[Belson]</a>: are voting against it need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1208.063s">[Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1216.129s">[Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1219.471s">[Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1223.535s">[Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1227.037s">[Belson]</a>: They're going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1229.639s">[Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, of the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1234.042s">[Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1238.345s">[Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1241.468s">[Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election, or the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1253.036s">[Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out, because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1259.642s">[Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1262.463s">[Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1263.844s">[Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1268.346s">[Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1276.792s">[Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1294.02s">[Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1299.322s">[Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1307.389s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1312.312s">[Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1315.975s">[Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1320.778s">[Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1330.184s">[Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1336.149s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1340.411s">[Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1344.312s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1345.512s">[Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1356.276s">[Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1358.537s">[Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1362.13s">[Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1363.471s">[Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1366.934s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1378.382s">[Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1383.848s">[Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1385.129s">[Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1390.692s">[Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1396.995s">[Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1405.52s">[Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1409.422s">[Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1414.798s">[Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1416.96s">[Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1423.544s">[Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1437.634s">[Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1441.377s">[Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1443.325s">[Belson]</a>: The big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1445.966s">[Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1447.006s">[Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1450.707s">[Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1453.048s">[Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1457.709s">[Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1461.75s">[Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1464.724s">[Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1466.825s">[Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department, you don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1474.989s">[Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1478.551s">[Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1483.114s">[Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1486.536s">[Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1488.416s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=860.446s">[Belson]</a>: language instruction of the elementary grades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=862.888s">[Belson]</a>: It's a tremendous program, and they've involved the Italian Consulate, and as you know, there's been many more activities besides just the language instruction that they brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=871.476s">[Belson]</a>: The only thing I'm disappointed in tonight, Chikandra, is the fact that I thought you were gonna give me a Ferrari tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=877.981s">[Belson]</a>: I thought that was part of the deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=879.542s">[Belson]</a>: But, having not received that, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=882.965s">[Belson]</a>: Sorry, but you know they did bring...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=900.277s">[Belson]</a>: So now watch what happens with this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=902.759s">[Belson]</a>: Christine, come on up and get it before I spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1058.952s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1060.453s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1061.353s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1062.434s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1063.735s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1064.956s">[Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1183.603s">[Belson]</a>: Let me go over them real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1186.802s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1190.044s">[Belson]</a>: Pursuant to our budget hearings that we had last Thursday, we reviewed some of the items that you brought up and tried to make some adjustments based on available funding that occurred during the few days that came after that meeting, and also based on what we perceived to be errors in the budget, at least in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1214.181s">[Belson]</a>: So in front of you, you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1217.078s">[Belson]</a>: a budget document follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1218.499s">[Belson]</a>: I'm just going to go through it for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1223.363s">[Belson]</a>: Two resignations from the vocational school, faculty yielded $17,116 in savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1230.047s">[Belson]</a>: One was in the auto shop and the other was part of the engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1234.75s">[Belson]</a>: Salaries would allow some gapping between what they would have made if they had stayed and what we will replace them at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1242.135s">[Belson]</a>: So that gives us back $17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1246.672s">[Belson]</a>: There was a few resignations from the special ed faculty, and that will yield another $3,339.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1252.694s">[Belson]</a>: And these total areas, the two of them, give us $20,455 in available funding to be reapplied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1263.857s">[Belson]</a>: So one area that you actually voted the other evening was the banned travel account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1271.177s">[Belson]</a>: Is that applause or is that just a... The band travel account got $3,000 that you actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1279.824s">[Belson]</a>: Now, just so we understand, we have not changed the lines in your budget because until we make all the agreements tonight, we're not going to change things internally because once we change one page, we have to change five or six pages at least, minimum, because they all play off each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1295.477s">[Belson]</a>: So, we're putting $3,000 into the band account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1299.592s">[Belson]</a>: The elementary textbook account is going to be increased by $1,500 per school for a total of $6,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1305.255s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we put it in textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1307.276s">[Belson]</a>: It can be used for educational materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1308.817s">[Belson]</a>: It can be used for supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1310.338s">[Belson]</a>: Whatever the principal feels is important, but that gives them a little bit more back based on some of the discussion that was had the other evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1321.524s">[Belson]</a>: The crew athletic program is expanding rapidly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1324.545s">[Belson]</a>: We've had several meetings outside of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1326.907s">[Belson]</a>: The mayor has hosted several meetings, and there's several things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1330.375s">[Belson]</a>: They have two seasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1331.856s">[Belson]</a>: In order to supply the coaches, we are $8,400 short, so we added that to the athletic budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1338.48s">[Belson]</a>: So we would cover that situation going forward this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1343.523s">[Belson]</a>: And then there were two corrections to the principalships of the Andrews and the McGlynn Elementary that needed to be brought up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1351.687s">[Belson]</a>: They were using older numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1354.867s">[Belson]</a>: That required $1,463 to go to the Andrews and $1,692 to the McGlynn Elementary Principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1363.514s">[Belson]</a>: So the total additions of recaptured funds evens out at $20,455.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1369.539s">[Belson]</a>: The above adjustments and corrections will be made tonight if they're approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1374.684s">[Belson]</a>: And as we progress toward the school budget, the end of the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1381.123s">[Belson]</a>: There will be multiple changes based on personnel matters and non-salary costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1387.409s">[Belson]</a>: So there will be people that come and go, just like there are all year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1391.493s">[Belson]</a>: And we will bring you up to date periodically in order to free up some funds, either to fill an account that might need a boost because of cost, or maybe to add something back that we couldn't add back in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1407.458s">[Belson]</a>: So as I said, we're not changing budget lines because it would affect too many page changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1412.059s">[Belson]</a>: We'll make the line adjustments once all decisions are made regarding the budget and provide copies to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1418.94s">[Belson]</a>: Additionally, the second page of what you've been handed has a report on union settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1424.641s">[Belson]</a>: And as I reported the other evening, the only union settlement at this point in time is a union settlement with the administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1433.815s">[Belson]</a>: We're going to recommend later on this evening to look at the unit building principles and other units are still being negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1442.158s">[Belson]</a>: We have some discussion tonight about the teacher's contract and we're meeting with the teachers tomorrow as well as the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1448.381s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll give you information in that executive session as part of negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1454.603s">[Belson]</a>: In addition, today we met extensively with Safe Havens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1459.568s">[Belson]</a>: That's the group that is doing the comprehensive study of our security procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1464.991s">[Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1467.513s">[Belson]</a>: Another visit will be coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1469.834s">[Belson]</a>: They've already had two visits now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1473.056s">[Belson]</a>: And when that is ready, we will come back with them with some recommendations regarding security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1479.94s">[Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have kept the security line in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1484.21s">[Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean that that will be the way we expend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1488.032s">[Belson]</a>: It will be tied to the recommendations of Safe Havens and the wishes of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1493.874s">[Belson]</a>: So let's see what that report tells us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1496.896s">[Belson]</a>: There are a number of things we talked about today that are non-cost items that we think could be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1503.879s">[Belson]</a>: There's some repositioning things that could also be helpful, no-cost items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1507.841s">[Belson]</a>: And there are some things that are low-cost items that they think would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1513.185s">[Belson]</a>: Let's let that report come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1514.966s">[Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have the line item in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1518.148s">[Belson]</a>: We're not going to spend against it until that report comes out, but we'll prepare ourselves to go in several directions and provide information to the committee so that we're ready to move once we see that report and once we reach some agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1532.676s">[Belson]</a>: So that is that piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1536.11s">[Belson]</a>: Again, one other item that came up the other evening that I think deserves some sort of mention tonight, and that's the Buildings and Grounds budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1546.554s">[Belson]</a>: We believe that the projects that will be most consistent with what the community is asking for and what we've seen must come from capital funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1556.278s">[Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget will not meet those needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1561.11s">[Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget reflects our savings in telephone, reflects our savings in various forms of energy, reflects our savings in other areas, in cleaning, that we believe we can absorb at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1579.282s">[Belson]</a>: And that allows the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1582.17s">[Belson]</a>: to consider our capital requests, which I've given you some suggestions, but certainly others may be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1589.977s">[Belson]</a>: And as a committee and the mayor, you can sit and decide what you think is most appropriate as opposed to anything that I might think is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1599.286s">[Belson]</a>: And certainly Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent will weigh in as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1603.747s">[Belson]</a>: I should tell you this evening that she would be here except the fact that her son Elijah had his wisdom teeth pulled and she's home giving him some comfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1612.199s">[Belson]</a>: But I spoke to her and I've gone over the materials and I know that she's in support of what I'm giving him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1618.535s">[Belson]</a>: So I feel comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1620.456s">[Belson]</a>: But that's what we've done so far since Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1623.859s">[Belson]</a>: And I would hope that the committee would support the budget as we've presented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1627.121s">[Belson]</a>: A lot of work has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1629.763s">[Belson]</a>: Staff has worked very hard to make things fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1632.325s">[Belson]</a>: Budgets have contingencies in them, as we've talked about the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1635.187s">[Belson]</a>: You never know when something new is going to pop up, and you never know when we're going to save something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1639.27s">[Belson]</a>: But that's the process of managing a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1642.172s">[Belson]</a>: And that's what we do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2256.556s">[Belson]</a>: Let me try and answer some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2258.157s">[Belson]</a>: First of all, there's only one reduction in the vocational faculty, and that's for a program that only had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2264.859s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, you can't sustain a program with one student, and the demand statewide has gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2270.701s">[Belson]</a>: We just have to be realistic when a program is not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2273.558s">[Belson]</a>: going to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2275.378s">[Belson]</a>: We can't fund it just simply because we've always had it or had it for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2280.1s">[Belson]</a>: Programs will come and go a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2281.64s">[Belson]</a>: New programs will emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2283.42s">[Belson]</a>: And there may be that coming forward a year from now, there might be a plumbing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2287.621s">[Belson]</a>: There might be some other program that is more likely to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2292.022s">[Belson]</a>: You talked about landscaping the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2293.723s">[Belson]</a>: It might be something that's more attractive than the program that has one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2298.844s">[Belson]</a>: So the only reduction is the one teacher from the program that had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2304.47s">[Belson]</a>: As far as the dollars and cents go, I don't want to get into individuals right now, but I know that some of them moved closer to home and also got more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2313.677s">[Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2314.858s">[Belson]</a>: And that's usually an attraction for people in the trades when they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2320.163s">[Belson]</a>: We just simply need to pay attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2322.364s">[Belson]</a>: The money we have, we're not moving any money away from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2324.966s">[Belson]</a>: We're just simply saying that at this point in time, in order to cover the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2328.554s">[Belson]</a>: variances or the different adjustments that you want, this is a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2333.296s">[Belson]</a>: But if a person costs more money, we'd go to undistributed to take that money from that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2337.637s">[Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2338.758s">[Belson]</a>: So there's ways to make that up, but we have to begin someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2343.879s">[Belson]</a>: You take it where it exists initially, and then you move to cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2391.568s">[Belson]</a>: Um, so, so recruitment is underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2394.209s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, we're certainly going to recruit people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2395.81s">[Belson]</a>: We're going to make every effort to bring people in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2398.372s">[Belson]</a>: Can I absolutely give you a, you know, a guarantee that we'll have the person we want by September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2403.375s">[Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2404.607s">[Belson]</a>: But it's highly likely we'll be aggressive out there to get people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2407.709s">[Belson]</a>: And there are people out there who want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2410.09s">[Belson]</a>: And if a person has got good skills and ability, it may require getting a waiver from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in order to help them bridge the gap between their trade and also their teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2422.117s">[Belson]</a>: But we certainly have no intention of diminishing the faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2427.401s">[Belson]</a>: These things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2428.201s">[Belson]</a>: English teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2429.102s">[Belson]</a>: Social studies teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2430.302s">[Belson]</a>: People come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2432.023s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll be at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2434.437s">[Belson]</a>: We'll be on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2691.36s">[Belson]</a>: I think, you know, the mayor has got many projects in front of her, you know, and I'll let her answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2695.541s">[Belson]</a>: But I mean, obviously the schools were important, and I think she recognizes that has been generous over a period of time as as a predecessor has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2704.944s">[Belson]</a>: And I just think we need to put a list together and see where we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2708.565s">[Belson]</a>: But I think we, you know, need to give ourselves a multi year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2712.186s">[Belson]</a>: You can't promise everybody everything all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2714.729s">[Belson]</a>: But if people see progress, I think they'll be encouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2717.971s">[Belson]</a>: And I think we can work from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2837.757s">[Belson]</a>: I'm just going to suggest to you, you might be more productive to refer it to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2843.44s">[Belson]</a>: Because it's clearly not a legal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2846.261s">[Belson]</a>: It's clearly a way that the legislature funds these things statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2852.744s">[Belson]</a>: And there are reasons why they place people in different homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2855.766s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes there may be housing available in some communities, sometimes not in others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2860.028s">[Belson]</a>: But maybe there could be an option that the legislature could put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2863.57s">[Belson]</a>: But I don't think that the solicitor can tell you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2866.823s">[Belson]</a>: that the legislature must do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2868.964s">[Belson]</a>: I think the solicitor can tell you that, you know, the possibility exists if they choose to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2881.112s">[Belson]</a>: They technically are, but it's always subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2883.874s">[Belson]</a>: The famous last words of subject to appropriation, which means if they don't appropriate the money, they don't have to reimburse us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3494.615s">[Belson]</a>: I've been around a long time, as most of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3497.276s">[Belson]</a>: And some people think too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3498.657s">[Belson]</a>: But nevertheless, I've seen a lot of budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3502.399s">[Belson]</a>: If you get hung up on any one item,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3506.352s">[Belson]</a>: You're not helping because the budget is much bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3509.934s">[Belson]</a>: We've got to be able to look at the budget in its totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3513.277s">[Belson]</a>: You can express your displeasure or your concern about an item or a particular thing, but you don't want to not vote for the things that you do care about, supplies for the kids, teachers, materials, all the kinds of things, services that kids need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3530.869s">[Belson]</a>: I think, you know, if you have an objection to a particular item, express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3536.17s">[Belson]</a>: But don't not vote for the whole budget, because the budget probably has many things in it that you do want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3542.655s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that's really something to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3544.936s">[Belson]</a>: You can come out and say what you don't like, but you certainly want to support all the resources, $60 million worth of resources going to young people and families in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3558.366s">[Belson]</a>: That's the way you've got to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3559.347s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, that's the way I have to look at it every year, because there are many things that I would like to put in the budget that I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3565.853s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, if I had, you know, an unlimited checkbook, you'd be a lot more things in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3570.335s">[Belson]</a>: But no one ever does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3572.015s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, today, you should know that the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled against the Fair Share Amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3578.317s">[Belson]</a>: That's the million dollars tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3580.958s">[Belson]</a>: That's 1.9 to 2 billion dollars worth of lost revenue that the Commonwealth will not... And the legislature is going to have to struggle, and the governor is going to have to struggle with how they are going to fund things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3594.541s">[Belson]</a>: The discussion of the foundation budget is rife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3597.422s">[Belson]</a>: Some of the offsets are rife, circuit breaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3599.483s">[Belson]</a>: We've talked about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3601.623s">[Belson]</a>: Where are the resources going to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3603.284s">[Belson]</a>: So no one, whether it's the state level or our level, gets to fund everything they believe should be in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3612.327s">[Belson]</a>: So I would just suggest that if there's a particular item that you feel needs more attention going forward, you express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3622.115s">[Belson]</a>: But don't withhold your support for a whole budget, because you're basically saying the other things aren't worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3628.837s">[Belson]</a>: Of course they're worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3630.217s">[Belson]</a>: A lot of things are worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4418.444s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna share this with our assistant superintendent for finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4422.967s">[Belson]</a>: Come on up, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4424.627s">[Belson]</a>: She did all the work in getting it together and out to, with Schaub and working together to get the stuff in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4431.891s">[Belson]</a>: And we got back exactly what we expected to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4437.193s">[Belson]</a>: because that's what we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4439.294s">[Belson]</a>: But I think what's really significant beyond the work in here is the kinds of things that Lesley College is willing to do with us, and this is only the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4450.5s">[Belson]</a>: We've had some really productive discussions, they'll continue, and you know, Maurice has been involved and will continue to get more people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=110.386s">[Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=112.307s">[Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.007s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.667s">[Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=120.31s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=122.553s">[Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=125.614s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=141.34s">[Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.041s">[Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.921s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=149.843s">[Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=152.506s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=153.327s">[Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=154.347s">[Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=158.53s">[Belson]</a>: Probably, what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=160.011s">[Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=165.195s">[Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=169.317s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1890.439s">[Belson]</a>: So there is none?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1891.719s">[Belson]</a>: So we don't have a full minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1895.641s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1934.03s">[Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5176.12s">[Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5188.21s">[Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5192.353s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5194.354s">[Belson]</a>: And we hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5209.168s">[Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5212.549s">[Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5229.273s">[Belson]</a>: I can't tie her up every day so I mean so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5235.7s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5236.5s">[Belson]</a>: She'll give me a feedback as well and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6620.28s">[Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6623.442s">[Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6627.404s">[Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6629.385s">[Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6632.467s">[Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6634.713s">[Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6637.234s">[Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6641.437s">[Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6647.34s">[Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6648.48s">[Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6652.062s">[Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6655.744s">[Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6664.515s">[Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6668.696s">[Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.157s">[Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.858s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6675.278s">[Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6677.338s">[Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6682.14s">[Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6685.441s">[Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6687.321s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6695.457s">[Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6698.938s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6701.319s">[Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of tradeoffs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6702.92s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6708.502s">[Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6709.982s">[Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6753.907s">[Belson]</a>: Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6761.711s">[Belson]</a>: But things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6917.98s">[Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6921.881s">[Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6933.763s">[Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6937.359s">[Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6940.58s">[Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6941.54s">[Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6942.54s">[Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6944.681s">[Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6953.602s">[Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6961.924s">[Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6967.317s">[Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6971.64s">[Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6974.642s">[Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7120.91s">[Belson]</a>: Well, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7123.651s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7125.391s">[Belson]</a>: Do you have a sense of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7624.287s">[Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7627.528s">[Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of the plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7641.651s">[Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7644.928s">[Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7647.91s">[Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7664.12s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7669.524s">[Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7675.085s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7680.007s">[Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7695.192s">[Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7702.935s">[Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7706.598s">[Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7708.82s">[Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week posting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7711.843s">[Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7722.052s">[Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7731.302s">[Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7740.769s">[Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7751.037s">[Belson]</a>: In other words, saying they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7757.262s">[Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7758.96s">[Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7764.343s">[Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7769.565s">[Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7779.13s">[Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7784.818s">[Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7791.703s">[Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7801.23s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7804.112s">[Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7812.422s">[Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7821.727s">[Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7843.103s">[Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.043s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.344s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.744s">[Belson]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7845.324s">[Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7849.748s">[Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7865.692s">[Belson]</a>: Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7871.213s">[Belson]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7885.657s">[Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7888.351s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, that like all these universities would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7931.672s">[Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work, based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7940.156s">[Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7945.319s">[Belson]</a>: It probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7958.406s">[Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7961.733s">[Belson]</a>: So many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7963.714s">[Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7969.036s">[Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7978.259s">[Belson]</a>: I just don't see us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7979.48s">[Belson]</a>: The benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8002.367s">[Belson]</a>: Because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8013.011s">[Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8016.392s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8018.548s">[Belson]</a>: because essentially they can work on it and we can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8026.653s">[Belson]</a>: Oh yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8028.074s">[Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8029.415s">[Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8049.618s">[Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8059.282s">[Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8061.623s">[Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8062.384s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8067.786s">[Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8072.269s">[Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8075.815s">[Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8086.657s">[Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8087.777s">[Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8090.878s">[Belson]</a>: We have to go over very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8092.918s">[Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8097.859s">[Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8111.934s">[Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, that's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8117.819s">[Belson]</a>: We may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8118.78s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8152.87s">[Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.331s">[Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.551s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8155.412s">[Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8161.338s">[Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8165.583s">[Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards, okay, which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8172.712s">[Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8174.535s">[Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8222.887s">[Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8223.548s">[Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8225.449s">[Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8233.775s">[Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8237.153s">[Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8242.538s">[Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9073.955s">[Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9075.997s">[Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9080.078s">[Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9085.56s">[Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9091.341s">[Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9095.102s">[Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9103.418s">[Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9105.179s">[Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9107.579s">[Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9115.662s">[Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9118.723s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people, perhaps, to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9128.887s">[Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9132.652s">[Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9137.196s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9142.079s">[Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9143.12s">[Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9145.282s">[Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9150.046s">[Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9154.169s">[Belson]</a>: During the course of the year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9156.891s">[Belson]</a>: We have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other, and because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9165.895s">[Belson]</a>: Now, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9168.376s">[Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9170.116s">[Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9171.677s">[Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9177.299s">[Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one, because they go with their friends, because that's one of the biggest reasons why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9186.227s">[Belson]</a>: people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9189.988s">[Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9193.43s">[Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9198.792s">[Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9208.176s">[Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9212.397s">[Belson]</a>: and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send them might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9223.383s">[Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9227.485s">[Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9229.887s">[Belson]</a>: So we just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9231.788s">[Belson]</a>: We just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9234.009s">[Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9236.09s">[Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9238.551s">[Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9242.275s">[Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9250.299s">[Belson]</a>: But we're gonna make a decision because we gotta get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9252.9s">[Belson]</a>: Because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9294.043s">[Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9297.664s">[Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9304.078s">[Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9306.859s">[Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.001s">[Belson]</a>: That's going to happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.741s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9423.383s">[Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9426.605s">[Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9429.567s">[Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9431.748s">[Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9439.912s">[Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9444.336s">[Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that this won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9450.761s">[Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9453.002s">[Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9464.812s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9468.147s">[Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9545.186s">[Belson]</a>: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9547.847s">[Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9548.567s">[Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9550.868s">[Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9552.768s">[Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9554.609s">[Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9556.769s">[Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9560.63s">[Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9565.952s">[Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9571.653s">[Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9577.069s">[Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10224.948s">[Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10234.393s">[Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10237.255s">[Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10241.778s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10244.28s">[Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10256.568s">[Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10265.35s">[Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10273.552s">[Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10275.633s">[Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10279.534s">[Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10286.676s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10331.998s">[Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10335.22s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins, and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10338.582s">[Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10340.023s">[Belson]</a>: It's not going to change the balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10341.564s">[Belson]</a>: But you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10342.985s">[Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10344.866s">[Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10636.261s">[Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10638.021s">[Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10642.003s">[Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10649.985s">[Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10652.526s">[Belson]</a>: And then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10656.057s">[Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10660.658s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11574.531s">[Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11589.743s">[Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11591.244s">[Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11593.257s">[Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11595.398s">[Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11596.638s">[Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11597.698s">[Belson]</a>: You're going to want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11602.159s">[Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.681s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.941s">[Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for effects to the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11613.303s">[Belson]</a>: It's not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11615.483s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11622.528s">[Belson]</a>: They can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11623.829s">[Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11735.074s">[Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can, under community participation, provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11742.696s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11746.737s">[Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11752.797s">[Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=110.429s">[Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.29s">[Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.99s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=113.65s">[Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical Chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=120.293s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=122.539s">[Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=125.6s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=141.368s">[Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.029s">[Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.889s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=149.812s">[Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=152.472s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=153.312s">[Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=154.333s">[Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=158.494s">[Belson]</a>: Probably what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=159.974s">[Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=163.415s">[Belson]</a>: Six or seven at minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=165.175s">[Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=169.297s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1885.616s">[Belson]</a>: We haven't approved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1889.918s">[Belson]</a>: That's the report you put in the wrong place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1892.8s">[Belson]</a>: It's really not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1893.86s">[Belson]</a>: The only question is, is he?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1897.902s">[Belson]</a>: There's none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1898.483s">[Belson]</a>: That's an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.423s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.523s">[Belson]</a>: The only question was they passed on a 7-0 for just a vote, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1934.302s">[Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5176.1s">[Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5188.19s">[Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5192.334s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5195.492s">[Belson]</a>: We hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5209.142s">[Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5212.545s">[Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5219.41s">[Belson]</a>: Give us feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5228.677s">[Belson]</a>: Schedule, I can't tie her up every day, so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with, we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.682s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.882s">[Belson]</a>: And then she'll give me her feedback as well, and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6620.263s">[Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6623.405s">[Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6627.388s">[Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6629.349s">[Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6632.451s">[Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6634.696s">[Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6637.198s">[Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6639.959s">[Belson]</a>: And that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6641.4s">[Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6647.323s">[Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6648.464s">[Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6652.046s">[Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6655.728s">[Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6664.481s">[Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6668.663s">[Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.144s">[Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.845s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6675.245s">[Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6677.326s">[Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6682.128s">[Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6685.429s">[Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6687.31s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6695.423s">[Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6698.886s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6701.308s">[Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of trade-offs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6702.889s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6708.474s">[Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6709.955s">[Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6754.021s">[Belson]</a>: So if- Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood, but things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6917.952s">[Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6921.875s">[Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6933.765s">[Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6937.342s">[Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6940.563s">[Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6941.523s">[Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6942.523s">[Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6944.243s">[Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6953.565s">[Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6961.907s">[Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6967.28s">[Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6971.622s">[Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6974.604s">[Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7120.896s">[Belson]</a>: Paul, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7123.637s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7624.273s">[Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7627.494s">[Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of your plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7641.637s">[Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7644.911s">[Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7647.893s">[Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7664.105s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7669.509s">[Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7675.068s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm going to go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7679.99s">[Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals, for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7695.175s">[Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7702.898s">[Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7706.559s">[Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7708.78s">[Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week hosting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7711.8s">[Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7722.023s">[Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7731.265s">[Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7740.747s">[Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7751.229s">[Belson]</a>: I would say they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7757.23s">[Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7758.943s">[Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7764.326s">[Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7769.549s">[Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7779.115s">[Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7784.785s">[Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7791.67s">[Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7801.218s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7804.1s">[Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7812.385s">[Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7821.709s">[Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7843.086s">[Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7845.307s">[Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7849.71s">[Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7863.134s">[Belson]</a>: Or... Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use... Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7885.643s">[Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7888.574s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, like all these universities, they seem to think they have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7931.646s">[Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7934.392s">[Belson]</a>: based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7940.134s">[Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7945.296s">[Belson]</a>: And probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7958.14s">[Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of so many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7963.444s">[Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7969.012s">[Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7977.156s">[Belson]</a>: I just don't see us, the benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8002.106s">[Belson]</a>: because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of, you know, bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8012.972s">[Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8016.394s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better because essentially they can work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8020.436s">[Belson]</a>: We can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8026.639s">[Belson]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8028.06s">[Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8029.381s">[Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8049.602s">[Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8059.229s">[Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8061.61s">[Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8062.371s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8067.755s">[Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8072.258s">[Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8075.802s">[Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8086.65s">[Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8087.771s">[Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8091.014s">[Belson]</a>: We have to go over it very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8092.915s">[Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8098.48s">[Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8111.913s">[Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, let's be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8117.515s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, we may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8118.696s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8152.856s">[Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.317s">[Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.518s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8155.378s">[Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8161.324s">[Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8164.828s">[Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8165.549s">[Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.452s">[Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.812s">[Belson]</a>: Which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8172.697s">[Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8174.519s">[Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8176.621s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8222.87s">[Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8224.271s">[Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8225.432s">[Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8233.738s">[Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8237.116s">[Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8242.518s">[Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9073.918s">[Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9075.98s">[Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9080.603s">[Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9085.526s">[Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9091.31s">[Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9095.072s">[Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9103.402s">[Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9105.163s">[Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9107.563s">[Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9115.626s">[Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9118.707s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people perhaps to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9128.851s">[Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9132.635s">[Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9135.936s">[Belson]</a>: The McGlynn Elementary is a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9137.176s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9142.057s">[Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9143.097s">[Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9145.238s">[Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9149.999s">[Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9154.14s">[Belson]</a>: During the course of the year, we have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9163.236s">[Belson]</a>: And because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9165.878s">[Belson]</a>: And I, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9168.36s">[Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9170.101s">[Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9171.662s">[Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9177.286s">[Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9182.029s">[Belson]</a>: Because they go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9183.651s">[Belson]</a>: Because that's one of the biggest reasons why people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9189.975s">[Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9193.405s">[Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9198.769s">[Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9208.156s">[Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that, and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send anybody might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows, because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9223.372s">[Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9227.455s">[Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9229.857s">[Belson]</a>: So we've just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9231.738s">[Belson]</a>: We've just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9233.98s">[Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9236.061s">[Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9238.543s">[Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9242.266s">[Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9250.292s">[Belson]</a>: But we've got to make a decision because we've got to get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9252.836s">[Belson]</a>: because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9290.623s">[Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9291.744s">[Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9294.205s">[Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9296.347s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9297.648s">[Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9304.614s">[Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9306.836s">[Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9310.979s">[Belson]</a>: That's going to happen, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9311.72s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9423.352s">[Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9426.594s">[Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9429.536s">[Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9431.717s">[Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9439.903s">[Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9444.325s">[Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9449.123s">[Belson]</a>: This won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9450.724s">[Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9452.967s">[Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9464.777s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9468.13s">[Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9547.828s">[Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9548.549s">[Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9550.852s">[Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9552.734s">[Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9554.956s">[Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9556.737s">[Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9560.6s">[Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9565.925s">[Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9571.65s">[Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9577.055s">[Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10224.897s">[Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10234.365s">[Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10237.247s">[Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10241.771s">[Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10244.273s">[Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10252.005s">[Belson]</a>: with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10256.549s">[Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10265.315s">[Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10273.542s">[Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10275.623s">[Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10279.607s">[Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10286.66s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10331.99s">[Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10334.351s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10338.553s">[Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10340.72s">[Belson]</a>: change the balance, but you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10342.962s">[Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10344.683s">[Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10636.235s">[Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10637.997s">[Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10641.981s">[Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, and you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10649.969s">[Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15, and then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10656.035s">[Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11574.512s">[Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11589.739s">[Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11591.219s">[Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11593.223s">[Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11595.363s">[Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11596.624s">[Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11597.684s">[Belson]</a>: You want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11602.245s">[Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.645s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.925s">[Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for, you know, affects the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11613.767s">[Belson]</a>: Not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11615.487s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11622.491s">[Belson]</a>: they can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11735.038s">[Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can under community participation provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11742.66s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11746.701s">[Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11752.78s">[Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3624.865s">[Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3640.954s">[Belson]</a>: From time to time in my role,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3642.968s">[Belson]</a>: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3645.93s">[Belson]</a>: That's my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3647.37s">[Belson]</a>: I'm supposed to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3649.111s">[Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3651.212s">[Belson]</a>: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3658.316s">[Belson]</a>: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3664.699s">[Belson]</a>: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3666.94s">[Belson]</a>: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3672.523s">[Belson]</a>: Now, a police investigation is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3675.464s">[Belson]</a>: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3685.287s">[Belson]</a>: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3689.029s">[Belson]</a>: And some of those gaps do raise questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3692.01s">[Belson]</a>: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3699.122s">[Belson]</a>: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3704.664s">[Belson]</a>: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3712.486s">[Belson]</a>: Chief, appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4191.151s">[Belson]</a>: I'd like to continue for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4193.853s">[Belson]</a>: As the chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4200.812s">[Belson]</a>: that I thought was responsible for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4203.875s">[Belson]</a>: I took the blame myself, even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4215.865s">[Belson]</a>: But I took the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4217.906s">[Belson]</a>: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4229.098s">[Belson]</a>: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned, to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4248.514s">[Belson]</a>: My goal was to aid the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4252.958s">[Belson]</a>: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4259.112s">[Belson]</a>: But I didn't go there with a lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4261.292s">[Belson]</a>: I didn't ask for any representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4263.293s">[Belson]</a>: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4270.034s">[Belson]</a>: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4277.055s">[Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4280.956s">[Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4285.556s">[Belson]</a>: And in fact, as I look out, because I've been around a little while,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4289.294s">[Belson]</a>: I've probably hired most of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4291.575s">[Belson]</a>: Probably was the person who signed your employment letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4296.277s">[Belson]</a>: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4302.539s">[Belson]</a>: We've had some differences this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4304.32s">[Belson]</a>: That's factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4306.401s">[Belson]</a>: This isn't brand new this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4309.782s">[Belson]</a>: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4317.938s">[Belson]</a>: We're going to make a difference, and it's going to work out just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4322.479s">[Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4324.739s">[Belson]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4328.42s">[Belson]</a>: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.16s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.28s">[Belson]</a>: I have a person with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6945.715s">[Belson]</a>: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6952.901s">[Belson]</a>: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6958.887s">[Belson]</a>: She met with us before she toured our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6962.2s">[Belson]</a>: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6978.433s">[Belson]</a>: We have a number of open positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6981.796s">[Belson]</a>: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6993.023s">[Belson]</a>: So if in fact they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6998.047s">[Belson]</a>: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7005.954s">[Belson]</a>: We have after school programs, a director of early childhood is leaving, they run the after school programs, they oversee the family network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7013.701s">[Belson]</a>: All these things have to be taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7016.103s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7017.922s">[Belson]</a>: that the mayor and I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7027.184s">[Belson]</a>: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7033.765s">[Belson]</a>: These major administrative positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7036.065s">[Belson]</a>: And you get a chance to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7038.246s">[Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that Dr. Edouard-Vincent will have every opportunity to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7042.666s">[Belson]</a>: But if we stop our business right now, in July,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7047.614s">[Belson]</a>: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7056.0s">[Belson]</a>: And that's not a desirable outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7058.862s">[Belson]</a>: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7064.647s">[Belson]</a>: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7070.791s">[Belson]</a>: Got to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7072.252s">[Belson]</a>: You don't want to drop that on your new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7075.731s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7079.392s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you that Dr. Edouard-Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7085.275s">[Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7087.556s">[Belson]</a>: I want to finish strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7089.617s">[Belson]</a>: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7101.421s">[Belson]</a>: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7104.435s">[Belson]</a>: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7106.437s">[Belson]</a>: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7110.419s">[Belson]</a>: I'm going to work it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7113.081s">[Belson]</a>: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7125.931s">[Belson]</a>: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7132.155s">[Belson]</a>: is gonna have an awful lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7134.176s">[Belson]</a>: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7143.541s">[Belson]</a>: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7148.263s">[Belson]</a>: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7161.993s">[Belson]</a>: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7167.715s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7170.255s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you that she will be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7172.776s">[Belson]</a>: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7188.46s">[Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7191.383s">[Belson]</a>: I want to assure you that that's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7194.425s">[Belson]</a>: Let's finish strong together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7196.086s">[Belson]</a>: Let's have a good balanced budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7198.167s">[Belson]</a>: Let's put a budget together next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7200.389s">[Belson]</a>: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7210.836s">[Belson]</a>: I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7264.105s">[Belson]</a>: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7268.508s">[Belson]</a>: The reality is that this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7272.431s">[Belson]</a>: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7275.934s">[Belson]</a>: If my community doesn't need me to help,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7278.64s">[Belson]</a>: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7283.941s">[Belson]</a>: I certainly won't be a trucee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7285.861s">[Belson]</a>: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7293.423s">[Belson]</a>: I'm a phone call away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7294.823s">[Belson]</a>: I live down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7296.223s">[Belson]</a>: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7300.364s">[Belson]</a>: I've been superintendent and been in this school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7308.357s">[Belson]</a>: And this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7310.298s">[Belson]</a>: And I don't intend to reject my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7313.078s">[Belson]</a>: I don't intend to walk away from my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7316.379s">[Belson]</a>: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7325.702s">[Belson]</a>: But will I be helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7327.003s">[Belson]</a>: Of course I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7328.143s">[Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7332.364s">[Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to progress and do well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7336.069s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8469.525s">[Belson]</a>: Quick summary is that under school choice, people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8477.483s">[Belson]</a>: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8482.585s">[Belson]</a>: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8487.847s">[Belson]</a>: And we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8492.929s">[Belson]</a>: It just doesn't work under the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8495.39s">[Belson]</a>: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8500.912s">[Belson]</a>: That's not our situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8503.073s">[Belson]</a>: We have to notify the state by a certain date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9255.962s">[Belson]</a>: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9258.464s">[Belson]</a>: If you take the next two weeks, remember the principal who we are all talking about a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9264.601s">[Belson]</a>: who needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9266.942s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations, but we've had discussions and, you know, I think over the next several days we'll get an answer, that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9278.446s">[Belson]</a>: Second piece is that, we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9285.909s">[Belson]</a>: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9293.15s">[Belson]</a>: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9301.953s">[Belson]</a>: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and have their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9313.756s">[Belson]</a>: So a suggestion, over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9318.978s">[Belson]</a>: We talk to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9320.838s">[Belson]</a>: We go over the principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9323.663s">[Belson]</a>: make a serious effort, but at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you gotta act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9329.446s">[Belson]</a>: You gotta act because we gotta get in the business of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9331.788s">[Belson]</a>: We have to, you know, there's things to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9333.989s">[Belson]</a>: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9336.47s">[Belson]</a>: Now we don't need a one for one at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9339.652s">[Belson]</a>: They don't have to be exactly even, but they have to be close enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9343.995s">[Belson]</a>: They have to be within 15, 20 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9346.897s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9458.062s">[Belson]</a>: So, one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9460.102s">[Belson]</a>: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lubbock Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9463.863s">[Belson]</a>: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9468.066s">[Belson]</a>: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9476.632s">[Belson]</a>: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9480.474s">[Belson]</a>: So there's four or five things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9483.697s">[Belson]</a>: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9488.14s">[Belson]</a>: We just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9493.834s">[Belson]</a>: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9500.561s">[Belson]</a>: You have, you know, emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseum, no offense, about a person here and a person there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9510.511s">[Belson]</a>: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9514.475s">[Belson]</a>: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9518.921s">[Belson]</a>: It's going to send some other people unhappy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9520.984s">[Belson]</a>: So we've got to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9521.965s">[Belson]</a>: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9525.77s">[Belson]</a>: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9527.972s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9531.657s">[Belson]</a>: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9549.333s">[Belson]</a>: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9553.216s">[Belson]</a>: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.298s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.819s">[Belson]</a>: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9822.18s">[Belson]</a>: That's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10674.477s">[Belson]</a>: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10687.041s">[Belson]</a>: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10705.411s">[Belson]</a>: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game at Beverly High School this fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10715.995s">[Belson]</a>: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10726.08s">[Belson]</a>: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10729.962s">[Belson]</a>: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10732.77s">[Belson]</a>: but other sports do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10734.591s">[Belson]</a>: This includes soccer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10736.211s">[Belson]</a>: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10744.535s">[Belson]</a>: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10748.436s">[Belson]</a>: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10757.698s">[Belson]</a>: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10768.567s">[Belson]</a>: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10775.913s">[Belson]</a>: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10787.341s">[Belson]</a>: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10794.264s">[Belson]</a>: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10798.626s">[Belson]</a>: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10805.99s">[Belson]</a>: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10813.396s">[Belson]</a>: I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10814.276s">[Belson]</a>: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10818.437s">[Belson]</a>: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10824.178s">[Belson]</a>: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10895.215s">[Belson]</a>: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10901.524s">[Belson]</a>: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10904.488s">[Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10909.582s">[Belson]</a>: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10912.866s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10915.228s">[Belson]</a>: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10919.072s">[Belson]</a>: It would be difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10920.853s">[Belson]</a>: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10923.576s">[Belson]</a>: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10932.672s">[Belson]</a>: to take youngsters out of games and not just listen to the kids saying, I want to go back in, I want to go back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10938.096s">[Belson]</a>: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10944.22s">[Belson]</a>: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10948.703s">[Belson]</a>: There's a higher likelihood of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10951.605s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10954.387s">[Belson]</a>: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10959.21s">[Belson]</a>: If we intensify our coaches training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10962.8s">[Belson]</a>: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10972.442s">[Belson]</a>: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10977.803s">[Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11018.932s">[Belson]</a>: So typically the home team provides the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11022.313s">[Belson]</a>: But on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11026.694s">[Belson]</a>: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11030.475s">[Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11045.079s">[Belson]</a>: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11050.722s">[Belson]</a>: We can go a long way with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11051.863s">[Belson]</a>: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11059.348s">[Belson]</a>: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11061.329s">[Belson]</a>: The ambulance is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11062.71s">[Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11064.571s">[Belson]</a>: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11077.754s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11083.556s">[Belson]</a>: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.258s">[Belson]</a>: Did she already have it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.839s">[Belson]</a>: No, because I gave it to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11245.205s">[Belson]</a>: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11298.935s">[Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11303.677s">[Belson]</a>: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11307.099s">[Belson]</a>: Lesley has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11308.345s">[Belson]</a>: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11314.208s">[Belson]</a>: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11322.872s">[Belson]</a>: It's just too extensive, but we can work that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11327.514s">[Belson]</a>: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11330.955s">[Belson]</a>: This is not low level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11333.377s">[Belson]</a>: And we think that their proximity to us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11337.357s">[Belson]</a>: and the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11347.624s">[Belson]</a>: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11359.551s">[Belson]</a>: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11365.437s">[Belson]</a>: and that will not interfere with our otherwise operations and will help us upgrade our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11371.239s">[Belson]</a>: This is a win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11372.8s">[Belson]</a>: So we've got to move forward because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us and they've got a short window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11382.164s">[Belson]</a>: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13565.55s">[Belson]</a>: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13577.885s">[Belson]</a>: some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13585.872s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=17.455s">[Belson]</a>: Want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=23.737s">[Belson]</a>: There are people in the community who obviously were concerned, and so I respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=28.139s">[Belson]</a>: There's a certain element of people that have certain political agendas, and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=33.762s">[Belson]</a>: But we'll move forward, and in time, everything will heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=62.802s">[Belson]</a>: Well, naturally, you know, I wouldn't like my career to end this way, but it's, you know, but I think that we've still been able to do a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=70.486s">[Belson]</a>: Remember, this is 50 years, 23 as superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=95.114s">[Belson]</a>: A decision was made that people don't agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=100.413s">[Belson]</a>: but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community and that's never was my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=599.205s">[Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1181.741s">[Belson]</a>: President Roy Bellson, superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1185.983s">[Belson]</a>: 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1189.544s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1192.605s">[Belson]</a>: Historically, the chief of police and the school system have worked very closely together on all security matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1201.749s">[Belson]</a>: In 1999, when Columbine hit, the chief and I were part of a group that formed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1208.427s">[Belson]</a>: the STARS program, School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1213.629s">[Belson]</a>: It was part of NMLEC, the Northeast Middlesex Law Enforcement Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1217.791s">[Belson]</a>: And since that time, we've worked very closely together to put together all kinds of security measures for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1225.313s">[Belson]</a>: And we communicate very regularly with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1229.435s">[Belson]</a>: When we think there's a danger, we talk and we take action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1236.778s">[Belson]</a>: Recently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1238.22s">[Belson]</a>: Back in and around December 28th or 29th, I'm not 100% sure of that date, a cleaning service that's employed by the public schools at the McGlynn Complex, middle school and elementary, found in the rear of the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, in the back row under a seat, a magazine clip that contained some ammunition in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1266.947s">[Belson]</a>: It is unclear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1268.359s">[Belson]</a>: how much ammunition was in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1270.48s">[Belson]</a>: We know that it could have been, based on the chief's estimate, at least three to four rounds, but not necessarily a full clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1279.006s">[Belson]</a>: We can't tell that because we don't have the magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1282.688s">[Belson]</a>: But from the picture that we were able to see, that's a reasonable estimate at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1291.114s">[Belson]</a>: The cleaning service turned it over to a custodian at the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1295.256s">[Belson]</a>: The custodian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1297.056s">[Belson]</a>: brought the magazine clip to the principal's office at the McGlynn Middle, and put it on a shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1305.92s">[Belson]</a>: That's the report that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1308.141s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. President, just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1323.488s">[Belson]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1326.488s">[Belson]</a>: School went on Christmas break on the 22nd of December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1335.095s">[Belson]</a>: To the best of our knowledge, at least at this point, we're checking on a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1340.519s">[Belson]</a>: Only one entity used the McGlynn during that weekend for a holiday service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1350.487s">[Belson]</a>: The cleaning service has informed us that they did a thorough cleaning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1356.71s">[Belson]</a>: of the facility, including the auditorium, which they would typically do on Fridays, and found nothing at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1367.652s">[Belson]</a>: The service was over sometime on Sunday, and the holiday commenced on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1376.634s">[Belson]</a>: Sometime around the 28th, the cleaning service went back into the theater, or the 29th, I'm not 100% sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1386.636s">[Belson]</a>: and they found under the seat in the back row this magazine clip that I just described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1394.199s">[Belson]</a>: It was turned over to the custodian, in-house custodian, whose name is Daniel Tully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1400.661s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Tully took that magazine clip, according to his report, and put it in the principal's office, Mr. Edwards' office, and he said on the shelf, along with some other things that were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1416.482s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Edwards has told us that he came into his office in and around the 30th of December to do some work and to do some cleaning, at which point he alleges that he cleared away some things that were unnecessary and may have, he doesn't know, may have discarded the magazine clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1458.112s">[Belson]</a>: Well, I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1465.814s">[Belson]</a>: And if you have other stories, I'll be happy to listen to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1468.995s">[Belson]</a>: But I'm telling you my latest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1476.294s">[Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1477.675s">[Belson]</a>: If I had a different story, I would say that also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1480.556s">[Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1483.477s">[Belson]</a>: I understand, but you have more information than I have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1488.859s">[Belson]</a>: So Mr. Edwards told me that he cleaned his office and he may have discarded the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1500.103s">[Belson]</a>: Now, if you know what a magazine clip looks like, it's about this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1505.913s">[Belson]</a>: It's black.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1508.214s">[Belson]</a>: Has some appearances that looks like it could be a small cell phone, small remote control, small other electronic device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1530.503s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know what other items he had there and how it could have been confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1535.196s">[Belson]</a>: But that's the story that he provided to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1539.657s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we did not have any evidence of a magazine clip available to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1547.859s">[Belson]</a>: Sometime in early January, Mr. Tully came to my office during his shift and told me about what he had found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1559.102s">[Belson]</a>: I asked him routine questions about where he found it, who was there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1565.475s">[Belson]</a>: Those kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1568.215s">[Belson]</a>: And he couldn't really fill in much more except the fact that he found it and put that in Mr. Edwards' office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1575.297s">[Belson]</a>: We checked with different other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1578.817s">[Belson]</a>: And at this point in time, I'm unable to identify where the chain of custody took place after Mr. Edwards allegedly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1594.195s">[Belson]</a>: discarded the item, or did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1597.856s">[Belson]</a>: Now, subsequent to that, we try to make some decision as to whether we felt this rose to the level of a reportable incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1611.8s">[Belson]</a>: I'm told that Officer Ricciardi, who is the school resource officer, was also told at some point in early January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1620.642s">[Belson]</a>: That's what I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1622.585s">[Belson]</a>: I want to be sure that I'm not 100% sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1627.809s">[Belson]</a>: At the time, we felt that it was an isolated incident, that it was something that was not dangerous in the sense because it wasn't a firearm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1641.88s">[Belson]</a>: Bullets don't fire themselves, not a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1644.582s">[Belson]</a>: No weapon was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1652.165s">[Belson]</a>: we should take our time and not raise anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1658.446s">[Belson]</a>: However, subsequent to that, in conversations that I've had with people in recent times, indicates to me that even though we did not feel it presented a clear danger, that other people do, and that they would have preferred that we made a full report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1682.506s">[Belson]</a>: to the chief of police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1684.166s">[Belson]</a>: And as I indicated earlier, the chief and I talk all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1688.487s">[Belson]</a>: I have no problem telling the chief anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1691.268s">[Belson]</a>: And we've talked about a lot of difficult situations over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1695.349s">[Belson]</a>: We don't hide things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1697.109s">[Belson]</a>: But a judgment was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1699.95s">[Belson]</a>: And that judgment said, we don't see this as dangerous at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1706.391s">[Belson]</a>: So therefore, I take responsibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1711.476s">[Belson]</a>: for not reporting it to the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1714.458s">[Belson]</a>: But I did so, I believe, in good conscience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1719.643s">[Belson]</a>: I believe that it was something that I needed to know more about before I raised it or elevated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1730.051s">[Belson]</a>: Over the years, I have reported any number of things the chief can verify to him that I thought were dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1737.537s">[Belson]</a>: I don't believe that Mr. Edwards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1742.042s">[Belson]</a>: would have any motive for not turning it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1746.344s">[Belson]</a>: After all, he wasn't there on the weekend, didn't belong to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1752.508s">[Belson]</a>: He has turned in many items, and Officer Ricciardi has indicated this, to him on multiple occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1760.292s">[Belson]</a>: So I don't believe he had any reason not to turn it in if he knew he had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1765.915s">[Belson]</a>: At this point in time, since it has become an issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1771.104s">[Belson]</a>: especially in light of what's taken place in other communities around the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1777.867s">[Belson]</a>: We have authorized a full sweep today, full sweep of the McGlynn Complex, which was conducted by Medford Police, Somerville Police, Everett Police, and Arlington Police with dogs that are weapons and drug trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1796.516s">[Belson]</a>: and we found no trace of weapons, ammunition, or drugs in the complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1802.621s">[Belson]</a>: I'm comfortable that that building is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1807.385s">[Belson]</a>: We have also initiated, in order to help the public feel comfortable, a sweep of all school buildings over the next few days to ensure that there is nothing there that would be of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1825.796s">[Belson]</a>: We are also planning this week to put together material, media, and others to talk to the public about the nature of school security, what we have in place, without getting into sensitive items, but what we have in place, and also to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1844.949s">[Belson]</a>: I have communicated with the Teachers Association President, Charlene Douglas, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1851.181s">[Belson]</a>: It's possible that I will meet with the McGlynn faculty on Monday afternoon to answer any questions they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1858.424s">[Belson]</a>: We believe that our schools are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1861.666s">[Belson]</a>: We believe that we do more than most school systems do to keep our schools safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1867.909s">[Belson]</a>: We believe that we will continue to review and upgrade what we have if we find that there is room here to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1880.762s">[Belson]</a>: and we believe that we can go forward recognizing that the decision that I made with others in my employee needs to be upgraded in the future and that a lesson learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1899.294s">[Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1905.978s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1914.627s">[Belson]</a>: No, the chief of police was not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1917.589s">[Belson]</a>: I did talk to the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1918.83s">[Belson]</a>: I did talk to the custodian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1920.41s">[Belson]</a>: I did talk to a couple of other people that I work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1924.853s">[Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, at that particular point in time, Officer Ricciardi did come in at some point, came to the conclusion that it was not something that warranted a full investigation at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1967.987s">[Belson]</a>: I saw the picture last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1972.91s">[Belson]</a>: And the clip is, if you look at the clip, you can see one bullet at the top, and then there are holes on the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1981.536s">[Belson]</a>: The chief can describe this better than I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1984.038s">[Belson]</a>: But he can tell how many rounds might be in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1988.321s">[Belson]</a>: But the person's hand covered most of it, holding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1993.304s">[Belson]</a>: So he couldn't tell beyond a certain point whether there were additional bullets beyond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1998.346s">[Belson]</a>: the 3 to 4 that he was able to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2033.727s">[Belson]</a>: We have notified people on all kinds of situations in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2058.239s">[Belson]</a>: We've reported multiple situations over the years of all kinds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2064.701s">[Belson]</a>: Certainly, you know, one can debate whether this rose to that level<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2071.889s">[Belson]</a>: But given the consensus that I have- All due respect, there's no debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2146.604s">[Belson]</a>: I'd like to respond to the notification issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2149.627s">[Belson]</a>: If you're speaking about a couple of years ago when there was a bomb threat at the high school, the issue wasn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2157.535s">[Belson]</a>: notification, the issue was timing of the notification, whether it was soon enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2162.956s">[Belson]</a>: And the committee decided to make it a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2166.297s">[Belson]</a>: We notified the public about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2168.858s">[Belson]</a>: We just didn't do it immediately afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2170.978s">[Belson]</a>: We did it a few hours later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2172.739s">[Belson]</a>: We felt that more people would be home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2174.699s">[Belson]</a>: But the committee felt differently, and we modified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2177.76s">[Belson]</a>: Now as far as this situation goes, it happened during a school vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2183.342s">[Belson]</a>: It happened when no students were in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2186.499s">[Belson]</a>: It didn't happen where there was a firearm anywhere near it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2191.082s">[Belson]</a>: And there was a plausible thought as to how it may have gotten there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2196.967s">[Belson]</a>: Now, since that time, we're all aware of what happened in Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2201.771s">[Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that there's a heightened feeling that somehow that is the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2208.536s">[Belson]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2209.875s">[Belson]</a>: However, Massachusetts has tremendous gun laws, tremendous gun laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2214.016s">[Belson]</a>: We can't buy what that individual bought in Florida, in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2219.937s">[Belson]</a>: You can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2222.418s">[Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, from my standpoint, I made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2226.939s">[Belson]</a>: In that decision, we have back and forth, and it was determined that that was the wrong decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2233.941s">[Belson]</a>: I accept responsibility for it, and we'll go forward from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2239.189s">[Belson]</a>: but I made the decision in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2241.63s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes, you know, we make decisions that people don't agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2245.091s">[Belson]</a>: If I thought there was something live, if I thought that students were in the building, if I thought there was a weapon anywhere near the place, my decision would have been different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2254.973s">[Belson]</a>: So I stand on that for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2256.634s">[Belson]</a>: I apologize to anyone who may feel that I did the wrong thing, but I certainly didn't do it with malintent or reason to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2268.786s">[Belson]</a>: let's say obfuscate any of the information from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2273.609s">[Belson]</a>: I'll stand on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2299.42s">[Belson]</a>: Why didn't I think it was necessary in January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2307.423s">[Belson]</a>: No, we don't think that's the case, because the cleaning service that found it cleans that area regularly and did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2316.406s">[Belson]</a>: It's clear to me that it landed there very recently in proximity to the time that it was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2395.841s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not gonna evaluate a principal in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2398.163s">[Belson]</a>: Let's understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2400.305s">[Belson]</a>: I will take actions on personnel matters as we go forward into the spring, but I'm not gonna evaluate a person in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2409.233s">[Belson]</a>: That's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2410.373s">[Belson]</a>: an appropriate way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2412.114s">[Belson]</a>: Individuals are entitled to due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2414.155s">[Belson]</a>: They're entitled to the protections of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2417.117s">[Belson]</a>: So the reality is that we will be reviewing personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2423.461s">[Belson]</a>: We will be reviewing policies and practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2426.423s">[Belson]</a>: We will be ramping up some of our drills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2428.945s">[Belson]</a>: I've also told the principals that the week we come back, we're going to run a special drill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2437.5s">[Belson]</a>: I'm a little concerned about it in some ways because I don't want to heighten in the students' minds that this is somehow an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2443.945s">[Belson]</a>: But on the other hand, I think we should at least do one more drill at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2450.009s">[Belson]</a>: It might help the community understand that we're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2453.232s">[Belson]</a>: But I think for the most realities of this thing, we will evaluate personnel and situations and policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2460.037s">[Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee is going to meet on Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2463.259s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sure that I'll hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2465.27s">[Belson]</a>: from them pretty directly about what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2468.891s">[Belson]</a>: And we will follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2471.012s">[Belson]</a>: And this judgment that I made won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2475.554s">[Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2670.12s">[Belson]</a>: So Councilor, you've been on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2672.402s">[Belson]</a>: And you've received multiple phone calls or letters from me when situations have happened over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2680.608s">[Belson]</a>: And I believe Councilor Scarpelli, you have also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2683.63s">[Belson]</a>: Anyone who's on the school committee knows that it's a regular practice, and we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2689.214s">[Belson]</a>: There are some things that happen in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2690.736s">[Belson]</a>: It could be a kid fight, something else like that, or in the backyard, or an injury, or something like that, that you just can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2698.956s">[Belson]</a>: take everything that happens every day and send it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2701.678s">[Belson]</a>: But having said that, this situation, in retrospect, was one that deserved notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2708.882s">[Belson]</a>: And the judgment that I made was not the best judgment at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2715.126s">[Belson]</a>: I accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2723.572s">[Belson]</a>: The school committee wants to be notified, Mr. Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2725.973s">[Belson]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2726.593s">[Belson]</a>: They want to be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2728.041s">[Belson]</a>: on situations that are serious and I should have notified them on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2776.803s">[Belson]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2777.964s">[Belson]</a>: And I just want to say that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2780.819s">[Belson]</a>: Normally, I tell the chief virtually everything because we have very good communication and have for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2787.443s">[Belson]</a>: In this instance, I didn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2788.804s">[Belson]</a>: I failed in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2790.445s">[Belson]</a>: I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2792.207s">[Belson]</a>: But typically, the school committee does want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2795.108s">[Belson]</a>: And I think it's clear to me that I should have informed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2798.671s">[Belson]</a>: But I don't believe and I think this is the key point that needs to be made and needs to be heard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2805.815s">[Belson]</a>: I don't believe our schools are unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2808.597s">[Belson]</a>: I don't believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2810.418s">[Belson]</a>: that our children are in danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2812.159s">[Belson]</a>: I believe that the school committee, the council, by paying money for cameras and other things like that, have provided quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2820.584s">[Belson]</a>: The police department has worked very closely with us, with resource officers, with all kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2825.267s">[Belson]</a>: We work closely with the district attorney to determine what's happening on the street on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2830.771s">[Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on that heads off issues in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2836.747s">[Belson]</a>: If I made a mistake this time, not if I made, I made a mistake this time, I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2842.772s">[Belson]</a>: But I believe enough's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2845.234s">[Belson]</a>: And I believe that if we, we dedicate ourselves to it, we'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2851.219s">[Belson]</a>: I believe our schools are safe as any school in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2856.083s">[Belson]</a>: But having said that, there are no guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2859.927s">[Belson]</a>: There are no guarantees that I can give you or anyone of sound mind could give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2865.438s">[Belson]</a>: because we live in a society that is a little violent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2868.32s">[Belson]</a>: We live in a society that does do unusual things at times, and we do have a lot of mental health out there, and there are guns on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2876.287s">[Belson]</a>: And that requires even more, more from the people that make decisions, make decisions about these issues and these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2883.814s">[Belson]</a>: But in this instance, I accept responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2910.011s">[Belson]</a>: I will put that on our calendar for Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.077s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2974.369s">[Belson]</a>: So let me ask a technical question of the clerk, if I may, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2978.691s">[Belson]</a>: We've posted a meeting, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2980.693s">[Belson]</a>: We've posted it at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2982.762s">[Belson]</a>: Can we make a modification if the chair agrees to make that modification under the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3031.059s">[Belson]</a>: So I'll communicate with your office tomorrow morning, and you can tell me whether we fall within the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.425s">[Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.725s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3061.769s">[Belson]</a>: Not at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3319.069s">[Belson]</a>: So a comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3323.362s">[Belson]</a>: Of all the letters in ALICE, the only one we don't do is confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3330.184s">[Belson]</a>: Because everyone alerts people if there's something going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3334.385s">[Belson]</a>: Everyone locks down if they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3337.707s">[Belson]</a>: Everyone informs mutual aid or assistance when they do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3343.948s">[Belson]</a>: And everyone tries to evacuate if they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3346.869s">[Belson]</a>: It's the confront part that becomes of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3350.471s">[Belson]</a>: And the reason it's of concern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3353.291s">[Belson]</a>: Think about young kids, little kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3355.872s">[Belson]</a>: Should they be trying to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3358.553s">[Belson]</a>: Are all teachers, are all staff physically able to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3363.635s">[Belson]</a>: Will they try to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3367.296s">[Belson]</a>: Can we mandate that they confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3370.517s">[Belson]</a>: There's a lot to this that needs to be thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3372.718s">[Belson]</a>: And what age group do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3375.259s">[Belson]</a>: And when do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3376.02s">[Belson]</a>: It's really an active shooter program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3377.34s">[Belson]</a>: It's not just a general program for bomb threats or things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3380.341s">[Belson]</a>: It's a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3381.322s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a lot to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3384.346s">[Belson]</a>: In that regard, who confronts and in what way, and who's able to confront, not everybody is going to be willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3394.713s">[Belson]</a>: So we have to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3396.074s">[Belson]</a>: Chief and I have talked about starting maybe with the older kids and the higher grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3404.64s">[Belson]</a>: There's some issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3405.56s">[Belson]</a>: But look, I am more than willing to have the discussion and to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3411.988s">[Belson]</a>: an active give and take on this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3414.829s">[Belson]</a>: But we need all the players who are going to be expected to step up to tell us whether they're prepared to confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3421.51s">[Belson]</a>: Now, the other day when the Parkland situation took place, if you remember the sequence, the individual pulled a fire alarm to get people to evacuate the setting and then was going to pick them off with his gun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3439.614s">[Belson]</a>: I've heard many times, why don't we evacuate this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3442.662s">[Belson]</a>: And I've told you in previous occasions that evacuation isn't always the best drill because the explosive or the sniper could be on the outside of the building, not just on the inside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3457.674s">[Belson]</a>: It's all situation-specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3460.496s">[Belson]</a>: And it needs to be talked about, more than willing to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3464.539s">[Belson]</a>: Let's not just put out alphabet soup, ALICE, and say that's a cure-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3469.763s">[Belson]</a>: Happy to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3471.184s">[Belson]</a>: Happy to get people to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3473.148s">[Belson]</a>: But it's got to be adopted and committed to by the people who are going to implement it, or else it's just another training program that will go nowhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3512.675s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3520.677s">[Belson]</a>: It's been offered to the president of the MTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.259s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.58s">[Belson]</a>: And she hasn't confirmed it yet, but she thinks it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3526.002s">[Belson]</a>: But she has to confirm it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3562.081s">[Belson]</a>: Well, that's a police investigation, so I leave that to the Chief to answer that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3620.655s">[Belson]</a>: STARS was set up to look at school threats, the acronym School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3628.377s">[Belson]</a>: So when a school threat is identified,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3631.243s">[Belson]</a>: or we believe it is identified, and we believe it requires additional resources above and beyond what we have, we would notify the STARS commanders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3642.128s">[Belson]</a>: Chief Sacco once headed that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3643.709s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not sure who heads it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3647.351s">[Belson]</a>: We would notify them, and they would provide us with those resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3651.493s">[Belson]</a>: So let's say we needed a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3653.254s">[Belson]</a>: They might have a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3654.515s">[Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a certain type of psychiatrist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3657.516s">[Belson]</a>: They would help us with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3659.017s">[Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a forensic help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3662.237s">[Belson]</a>: There are certain police departments and entities in the state that have forensic, the bomb squads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3666.838s">[Belson]</a>: They would coordinate the kind of specialized assistance that we need to make the appropriate threat assessment and then make the appropriate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3676.881s">[Belson]</a>: If we needed, unfortunately, a SWAT team, that would be the ultimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3684.423s">[Belson]</a>: But it's a coordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3685.904s">[Belson]</a>: And I want to make that point very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3687.364s">[Belson]</a>: There's a lot of people out there selling products about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3691.135s">[Belson]</a>: coordinating with schools and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3693.015s">[Belson]</a>: There's a lot of money being made in the school security business right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3697.276s">[Belson]</a>: And part of it brings up the idea that we could have an uncoordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3704.838s">[Belson]</a>: And that's the last thing we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3706.038s">[Belson]</a>: The chief and I both agree that if we have a situation that requires mutual aid or specialized assistance, we want that coordinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3716.854s">[Belson]</a>: You may not know, but I think we will have said it many times, but maybe you don't remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3722.057s">[Belson]</a>: There are floor plans on the computers of the police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3726.02s">[Belson]</a>: There are doors that are marked that people can go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3729.802s">[Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of pre-preparation in place for STARS to work and for our own police to respond strategically and specifically to areas which we believe require attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3744.906s">[Belson]</a>: What we don't want is we don't want what happened in 1992.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3747.747s">[Belson]</a>: Remember 1992?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3753.39s">[Belson]</a>: In 1992, there was a altercation at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3760.513s">[Belson]</a>: And at that time, people came from everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3763.054s">[Belson]</a>: Helicopters were flying over the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3764.694s">[Belson]</a>: People were coming in all different kinds of uniforms, not coordinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3768.276s">[Belson]</a>: And that only created more problems than it assisted in helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3773.857s">[Belson]</a>: So it's very important, and I thank the chief and his comrades at NMWEC for the work that they have put in to ensure that a response of that type through the STAR system is one that is coordinated, thorough, and strategic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3798.271s">[Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3799.872s">[Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3800.472s">[Belson]</a>: If it occurred when students were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3803.234s">[Belson]</a>: would have been a full report and immediate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3827.067s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not going to blame anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3831.383s">[Belson]</a>: I knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3832.684s">[Belson]</a>: I have a relationship with the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3835.364s">[Belson]</a>: I should have made the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3843.127s">[Belson]</a>: The next step is to continue to fortify and to continue to assess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3846.709s">[Belson]</a>: I expect to be in front of you in and around March 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3849.75s">[Belson]</a>: I know you're looking forward to seeing me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3852.311s">[Belson]</a>: Attempted humor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3856.926s">[Belson]</a>: to get funding for the upgrade to all the security cameras that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3863.972s">[Belson]</a>: We have upgraded all of them so that they're now capable to withstand some of the weather issues that previously they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3872.219s">[Belson]</a>: They have better visibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3873.48s">[Belson]</a>: They have better ability to pan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3876.022s">[Belson]</a>: And we think it's a distinct improvement over what we've been able to have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3881.267s">[Belson]</a>: So I'll be in front of you for that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3892.309s">[Belson]</a>: I think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3893.21s">[Belson]</a>: I think there are a lot of terrific groups that rent our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3895.431s">[Belson]</a>: And every group from Cub Scouts to all kinds of groups all the way up rent our schools or use our schools in a meaningful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3903.717s">[Belson]</a>: This is an outlier situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3906.278s">[Belson]</a>: This is not something that's happened frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3910.541s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe we didn't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3911.542s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe I didn't handle it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3914.65s">[Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean we should deprive the community of the resources of the schools, which I think are very important to providing appropriate recreation and assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3923.134s">[Belson]</a>: Look, shut down the pool, we just did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3925.055s">[Belson]</a>: You want to shut down the gymnasium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3926.616s">[Belson]</a>: We can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3928.196s">[Belson]</a>: We can't live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4050.478s">[Belson]</a>: So I appreciate the observation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4052.719s">[Belson]</a>: I can assure you that my conversations with certain individuals will be very direct and very thorough, and that decisions will be made about a lot of things in the next short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4130.249s">[Belson]</a>: I don't think it was a question of coordination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4133.274s">[Belson]</a>: Not notifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.216s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.496s">[Belson]</a>: I'll accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4477.022s">[Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4502.52s">[Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4505.022s">[Belson]</a>: But from time to time, we make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4508.629s">[Belson]</a>: That's what decision makers do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4510.21s">[Belson]</a>: We make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4511.711s">[Belson]</a>: And if I've made a decision that didn't square with everyone else, then I accept responsibility for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4518.196s">[Belson]</a>: But we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4519.878s">[Belson]</a>: And the chief will tell you that we have talked about some very tough items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4524.381s">[Belson]</a>: And there will be some things you don't know about because they're personal and they're caught up in legal matters that you can't know and the school committee gets advised of because it's not a public matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4533.869s">[Belson]</a>: But that's the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4535.27s">[Belson]</a>: And that's what's required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4537.981s">[Belson]</a>: But clearly on safety matters, safety matters, we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4543.663s">[Belson]</a>: Now as far as people using our facilities, we can cancel every basketball game, we can cancel every hockey game, let me finish, we can cancel every game where people come in who are visiting from some other place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4557.067s">[Belson]</a>: We know, we know that in society today there are some people out there that do horrible things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4565.188s">[Belson]</a>: And we can't just regulate everything that's going on all around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4570.054s">[Belson]</a>: Now, if you don't want to rent the school properties, if you don't feel that that revenue or that communication with the public is a good one, that can be a policy discussion with the school committee guided by some input that you want to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4582.688s">[Belson]</a>: But clearly, our schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4585.598s">[Belson]</a>: Our schools are going to be places, they've been community schools for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4589.0s">[Belson]</a>: People have used them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4590.281s">[Belson]</a>: And people come in visiting from other communities and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4594.244s">[Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, let me finish the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4596.785s">[Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, the event would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4600.768s">[Belson]</a>: So I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4603.31s">[Belson]</a>: But clearly, we don't hide anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4606.952s">[Belson]</a>: This was a situation, it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4610.374s">[Belson]</a>: And as I've said before, I'm taking responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4612.956s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how much more I can say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4644.977s">[Belson]</a>: That's my assumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4646.558s">[Belson]</a>: Investigation is undergoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4648.519s">[Belson]</a>: I'm not going to conclude anything until the police finish their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4652.161s">[Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4666.429s">[Belson]</a>: These buildings, when they're rented of that type, like for example, the Japanese language school has two security guards there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4671.212s">[Belson]</a>: They pay for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4676.195s">[Belson]</a>: They pay for coverage by custodians who function as security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4681.018s">[Belson]</a>: So we have custodians that are now security guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4683.199s">[Belson]</a>: Are they paying a different rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4685.261s">[Belson]</a>: They provide us with coverage in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4687.882s">[Belson]</a>: That's what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4715.355s">[Belson]</a>: We have provided some security, have paid for some security of certain people in these large groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4719.096s">[Belson]</a>: I've mentioned the Japanese as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4721.356s">[Belson]</a>: But, you know, not every group is paying for security, so maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4726.538s">[Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4727.278s">[Belson]</a>: Maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5508.517s">[Belson]</a>: So Mr. President, if I make one more comment, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5511.679s">[Belson]</a>: I've heard the word retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5514.04s">[Belson]</a>: There will be no retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5515.961s">[Belson]</a>: There are a couple of legal matters pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5518.823s">[Belson]</a>: And those legal matters are being represented by legal counsel of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5525.709s">[Belson]</a>: and to indicate that somehow something is wrong because we defend ourselves in a legal setting in this public forum is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5540.46s">[Belson]</a>: Furthermore, if there was any evidence of retaliation, I would not allow it in any way, shape or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5547.565s">[Belson]</a>: I hope you realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5549.146s">[Belson]</a>: And secondly, with regard to that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5553.012s">[Belson]</a>: There are situations and decisions that are made that people don't always agree with in terms of educational assignments, programs, services, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.276s">[Belson]</a>: But they're made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.956s">[Belson]</a>: Some people agree and some people disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5564.697s">[Belson]</a>: And that's the nature of how we plan and how we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5569.279s">[Belson]</a>: And just because there's some disagreement doesn't necessarily mean that people are at risk of losing their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5576.062s">[Belson]</a>: People have professional status rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5577.763s">[Belson]</a>: They have all kinds of rights under their contract, all kinds of rights under the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5583.464s">[Belson]</a>: Nothing's going to happen that's inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5585.845s">[Belson]</a>: If we disagree with someone on an issue, that can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5589.767s">[Belson]</a>: But that happens in almost every forum and any place you go, in any operation, there may be some disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5596.671s">[Belson]</a>: But no one is in jeopardy of losing their job in that regard because they spoke up or said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5603.675s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, I appreciate it when people speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5607.317s">[Belson]</a>: I like it when people speak to my face directly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5611.516s">[Belson]</a>: and call me on the phone when they've got something to say, rather than go to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5615.799s">[Belson]</a>: Not everybody does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5624.905s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5627.947s">[Belson]</a>: Well, there are people, Mr. President, there are people, Mr. President, who want to go and find out from the person responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5636.773s">[Belson]</a>: And there are people that go around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5637.833s">[Belson]</a>: I don't have a problem with that in this particular point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5640.947s">[Belson]</a>: but it does speak to the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5642.989s">[Belson]</a>: And as far as trust goes, it cuts two ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8679.368s">[Belson]</a>: This committee, the whole meeting, is already been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8683.251s">[Belson]</a>: Posted, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8684.372s">[Belson]</a>: Location, time, and 48-hour notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8687.154s">[Belson]</a>: So you just can't change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8701.785s">[Belson]</a>: It's a little easier to do, but this is our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8703.826s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8739.43s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I want to answer a couple questions that were raised during the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8743.791s">[Belson]</a>: I think it's important that this be public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8748.613s">[Belson]</a>: As I indicated earlier, I made the decision, whether it was right or wrong, I made that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8757.436s">[Belson]</a>: I did not inform the school committee or the mayor until Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8763.342s">[Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8766.844s">[Belson]</a>: And the police chief and I talked Friday morning, directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8771.086s">[Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that sequence at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8775.448s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8896.402s">[Belson]</a>: Regular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8064.853s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, so I have had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8069.796s">[Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8074.138s">[Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8075.639s">[Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8079.641s">[Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8086.685s">[Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8094.449s">[Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8099.256s">[Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8100.477s">[Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8108.308s">[Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8110.591s">[Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8116.236s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8121.72s">[Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8128.906s">[Belson]</a>: The play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8134.61s">[Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8146.097s">[Belson]</a>: And they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8152.024s">[Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8153.445s">[Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8154.446s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8156.708s">[Belson]</a>: I'm Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8158.829s">[Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8161.171s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8170.838s">[Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8172.219s">[Belson]</a>: I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8187.557s">[Belson]</a>: According to the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8200.416s">[Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8202.757s">[Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8208.14s">[Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8212.043s">[Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8224.049s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8228.832s">[Belson]</a>: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8235.3s">[Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8242.096s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's uh, you know an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8251.12s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked uh, Stephen Hershey who's the again superintendent of Beverly um, because mississippianities was contacting the Beverly school committee and others up in Beverly and uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8265.706s">[Belson]</a>: They are siding with the Beverly public schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8268.369s">[Belson]</a>: So I you know, I need a lot more Feeling as to what's really took place point of information man The superintendent has the game officials committee been contacted to find out who the referee was and I asked I asked for that information I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8286.129s">[Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8288.71s">[Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8290.31s">[Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8299.113s">[Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8308.555s">[Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8313.376s">[Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8334.247s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8335.388s">[Belson]</a>: I don't do a film in the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8336.589s">[Belson]</a>: game and they may have filmed the varsity game but I don't think from the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.35s">[Belson]</a>: game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8371.03s">[Belson]</a>: Let me let me if I can mirror let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey Because I'm putting on my cell phone and they'll give you an idea of you know, the strength of his comment It wasn't like I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8385.655s">[Belson]</a>: It's very very, you know direct So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8573.208s">[Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.416s">[Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.896s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8585.677s">[Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8587.619s">[Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8591.182s">[Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8595.905s">[Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8599.429s">[Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8604.914s">[Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8609.779s">[Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8613.943s">[Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8619.068s">[Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8620.529s">[Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8621.73s">[Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8624.132s">[Belson]</a>: So, we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8626.794s">[Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8631.919s">[Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8645.77s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8654.064s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8655.385s">[Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8660.589s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8661.23s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8662.25s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8812.785s">[Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8837.464s">[Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was prepared, that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8999.795s">[Belson]</a>: Pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9015.006s">[Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor too in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9017.248s">[Belson]</a>: You know, the more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive, you know, and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9254.312s">[Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9256.253s">[Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9257.853s">[Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9262.274s">[Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9267.196s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9275.478s">[Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9281.082s">[Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but then we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9287.706s">[Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9292.429s">[Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced who don't pay a user fee for athletics would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9299.693s">[Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9300.213s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.449s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.729s">[Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11990.658s">[Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative and you know but as we move forward we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12939.689s">[Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12943.711s">[Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12955.376s">[Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12957.277s">[Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12961.159s">[Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12963.9s">[Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just want to let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13804.928s">[Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13809.788s">[Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13823.18s">[Belson]</a>: cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13825.481s">[Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13833.907s">[Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13836.708s">[Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13841.811s">[Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13847.014s">[Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13853.345s">[Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13887.121s">[Belson]</a>: Let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13890.463s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13895.108s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13897.61s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13904.055s">[Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13912.699s">[Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13917.842s">[Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13933.73s">[Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13941.861s">[Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14037.225s">[Belson]</a>: have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14043.829s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14052.615s">[Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14073.236s">[Belson]</a>: We will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14083.024s">[Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14112.626s">[Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14124.95s">[Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14139.434s">[Belson]</a>: It was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14147.158s">[Belson]</a>: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14151.56s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge, cognitive language, is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14169.128s">[Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14174.87s">[Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14176.751s">[Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14184.594s">[Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14185.674s">[Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14190.416s">[Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14196.218s">[Belson]</a>: We are going to look at the blend of programs and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14212.768s">[Belson]</a>: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14216.75s">[Belson]</a>: been working to get SCI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14229.744s">[Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14235.49s">[Belson]</a>: receive students who have this English language need to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14244.513s">[Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14250.895s">[Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14253.076s">[Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14254.937s">[Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14256.277s">[Belson]</a>: Because as you move people around, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14260.818s">[Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14273.701s">[Belson]</a>: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14280.263s">[Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you'd come on up and give us a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14285.615s">[Belson]</a>: A discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14688.326s">[Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14691.948s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14693.228s">[Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14700.871s">[Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14708.314s">[Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14712.899s">[Belson]</a>: You have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.108s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.849s">[Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.758s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.998s">[Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL endorsement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.929s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14824.293s">[Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to Bernadette Bernadette to director of curriculum to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15241.797s">[Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15556.179s">[Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15557.48s">[Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.022s">[Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.703s">[Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15585.04s">[Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15590.003s">[Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15594.926s">[Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15600.649s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms of the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15618.257s">[Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15620.078s">[Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16210.543s">[Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16217.146s">[Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16227.49s">[Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16229.711s">[Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16236.013s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16244.859s">[Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16248.302s">[Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's a typical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=479.765s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=484.727s">[Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=489.089s">[Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=490.59s">[Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=494.591s">[Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer, who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=501.634s">[Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=509.398s">[Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=514.18s">[Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=515.42s">[Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=523.243s">[Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=525.524s">[Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=531.188s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=536.671s">[Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=543.855s">[Belson]</a>: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=549.557s">[Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=561.141s">[Belson]</a>: They gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=566.972s">[Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=568.393s">[Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=569.373s">[Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today from Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=573.775s">[Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=576.116s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=585.759s">[Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone, and I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.518s">[Belson]</a>: According to Beverly, uh, the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, um, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=615.367s">[Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=617.688s">[Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=623.649s">[Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=626.97s">[Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=639.194s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=643.779s">[Belson]</a>: And secondly, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=650.245s">[Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=657.028s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if... Well, that's an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=666.096s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the, again, superintendent of Beverly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=673.843s">[Belson]</a>: because Mississippi was contacting the Beverly School Committee and others up in Beverly and they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=683.326s">[Belson]</a>: So I need a lot more feeling as to what really took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=687.048s">[Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=694.95s">[Belson]</a>: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=701.098s">[Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=703.66s">[Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow-up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=705.261s">[Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=714.068s">[Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.495s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.895s">[Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=728.338s">[Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=749.193s">[Belson]</a>: I doubt they were filming the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=751.876s">[Belson]</a>: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=785.979s">[Belson]</a>: Let me, if I can, Mayor, let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey, because I'm going to put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of, you know, the strength of his comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=798.402s">[Belson]</a>: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=800.403s">[Belson]</a>: It was very, very, you know, direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=803.443s">[Belson]</a>: So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=988.087s">[Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.31s">[Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.77s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1000.571s">[Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1002.491s">[Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1006.073s">[Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1010.794s">[Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1014.337s">[Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1019.801s">[Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1024.665s">[Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1028.828s">[Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1033.951s">[Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1035.431s">[Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1036.612s">[Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1039.012s">[Belson]</a>: So we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1041.673s">[Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1046.794s">[Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1060.637s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1068.96s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1069.401s">[Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1070.261s">[Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1075.485s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1076.585s">[Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1225.986s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1227.627s">[Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1252.339s">[Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1414.68s">[Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1419.185s">[Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1430.024s">[Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1432.727s">[Belson]</a>: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1669.213s">[Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1671.154s">[Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1672.754s">[Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1676.655s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1677.175s">[Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1682.097s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1690.379s">[Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1695.983s">[Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1702.607s">[Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1707.33s">[Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1714.594s">[Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1715.114s">[Belson]</a>: So, we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1722.417s">[Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4405.439s">[Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4410.701s">[Belson]</a>: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5354.401s">[Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5358.422s">[Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5370.086s">[Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5371.987s">[Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5375.869s">[Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5378.05s">[Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6219.605s">[Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6224.464s">[Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6237.856s">[Belson]</a>: cameras have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6240.157s">[Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6248.879s">[Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6251.38s">[Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6256.482s">[Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6261.683s">[Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6268.021s">[Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6301.239s">[Belson]</a>: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6305.142s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6309.804s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6312.306s">[Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6314.327s">[Belson]</a>: But given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6318.75s">[Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6327.393s">[Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6332.534s">[Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6348.379s">[Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6356.504s">[Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6450.58s">[Belson]</a>: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6458.486s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6467.252s">[Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.667s">[Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6517.665s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you, Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6527.265s">[Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6539.607s">[Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6554.01s">[Belson]</a>: Uh, it was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6561.657s">[Belson]</a>: Uh, since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6565.44s">[Belson]</a>: Um, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we, we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that have required deep cognitive knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6579.771s">[Belson]</a>: cognitive language is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6583.794s">[Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6589.538s">[Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6591.44s">[Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6599.265s">[Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6600.346s">[Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6605.089s">[Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6608.832s">[Belson]</a>: uh, fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6609.773s">[Belson]</a>: However, we are going to look at the blend of programs, and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of, uh, situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6626.362s">[Belson]</a>: Uh, also, as you probably know, uh, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6631.305s">[Belson]</a>: I've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6644.395s">[Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6654.643s">[Belson]</a>: to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6659.208s">[Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6665.595s">[Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6667.777s">[Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6669.639s">[Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6675.525s">[Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the, um, beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what, what options are available to you and, uh, what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6688.276s">[Belson]</a>: Uh, but tonight, uh, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and, uh, some of the other things that, uh, Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6694.982s">[Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and, uh, give us a, uh, a discussion on, on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7103.469s">[Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7106.63s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7107.931s">[Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7115.495s">[Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7122.938s">[Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7127.563s">[Belson]</a>: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7201.787s">[Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7202.527s">[Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.431s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.671s">[Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7238.918s">[Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7655.803s">[Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7970.753s">[Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7972.074s">[Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7974.596s">[Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7975.296s">[Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7999.625s">[Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8004.588s">[Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8009.511s">[Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8015.234s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8032.832s">[Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8034.654s">[Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8625.134s">[Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8631.718s">[Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8642.064s">[Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8644.305s">[Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8659.434s">[Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8662.896s">[Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=34.028s">[Belson]</a>: We obviously lock in doors, put kids in places, put people in key strategic locations to watch doors and corridors and any other possible area where someone might get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=43.792s">[Belson]</a>: And everyone follow that exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=196.873s">[Belson]</a>: Kirsten's not here, but I. Oh, maybe you can help me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=224.474s">[Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations, a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two, the teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=239.34s">[Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line and those line items is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=252.492s">[Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=255.472s">[Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=256.213s">[Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=257.813s">[Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=262.775s">[Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=265.415s">[Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=326.448s">[Belson]</a>: This is for the hockey clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=353.886s">[Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=359.603s">[Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and the check is made out to the conference Strictly for her, you know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL we now belong to the Northeast Conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=397.17s">[Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=406.474s">[Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=451.832s">[Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=455.374s">[Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=459.297s">[Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=462.159s">[Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=659.015s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=707.948s">[Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=710.27s">[Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=715.307s">[Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=718.953s">[Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=782.364s">[Belson]</a>: I would suggest that you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=789.887s">[Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1387.381s">[Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1392.665s">[Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1394.966s">[Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1396.387s">[Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1398.829s">[Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1401.084s">[Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1410.328s">[Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1413.109s">[Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1416.23s">[Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1427.338s">[Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1443.483s">[Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1445.184s">[Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1449.305s">[Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1454.227s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1462.514s">[Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1471.989s">[Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1478.396s">[Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1484.696s">[Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1489.317s">[Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1501.799s">[Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1503.139s">[Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1507.52s">[Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1511.761s">[Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1513.904s">[Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1515.346s">[Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1516.207s">[Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1517.468s">[Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1520.192s">[Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1529.964s">[Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1532.369s">[Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1536.056s">[Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1543.223s">[Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1553.267s">[Belson]</a>: That's all, and that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1555.308s">[Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1559.57s">[Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1561.53s">[Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1565.452s">[Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1566.773s">[Belson]</a>: I appreciate your coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1568.093s">[Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1570.194s">[Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1571.675s">[Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1577.959s">[Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1578.64s">[Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.021s">[Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.941s">[Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2353.897s">[Belson]</a>: So I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2356.222s">[Belson]</a>: Adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate, but I can't let one thing go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2363.049s">[Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2370.096s">[Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2376.162s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2381.768s">[Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2383.83s">[Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2385.251s">[Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate, so ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2393.822s">[Belson]</a>: Good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2396.865s">[Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2398.247s">[Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2399.268s">[Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2402.853s">[Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2405.677s">[Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2406.918s">[Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2409.058s">[Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2410.659s">[Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2414.601s">[Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2415.861s">[Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, OK, you came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2417.962s">[Belson]</a>: You showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2421.443s">[Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2424.244s">[Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2426.465s">[Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2434.128s">[Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2435.865s">[Belson]</a>: you might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2455.681s">[Belson]</a>: I don't wanna go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2456.762s">[Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2461.866s">[Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2464.434s">[Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2470.317s">[Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2481.002s">[Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3234.613s">[Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3238.974s">[Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3251.278s">[Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3273.313s">[Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity, and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3289.364s">[Belson]</a>: So this program, Credit for Life, is one of the initiatives out of the state treasurer's office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so that we can have this Credit for Life Fair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3303.093s">[Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity, so I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3667.877s">[Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3679.471s">[Belson]</a>: Report on game change anti-violence partnership grant from New England Patriots Foundation So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3695.354s">[Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us who is our supervisor of health and physical education actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3701.563s">[Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program as we all know that you know young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3712.958s">[Belson]</a>: but they like to be associated with that and I think this is a really important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3716.821s">[Belson]</a>: It not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3717.862s">[Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3727.35s">[Belson]</a>: And we've gotta move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3729.091s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3731.253s">[Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material, a trainer's guide, some selected portions of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3736.057s">[Belson]</a>: I mean the whole thing would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3738.439s">[Belson]</a>: but you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3741.04s">[Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports-related kind of terminology in it, so it's like talking trash scenario, you know, the kinds of things like that, or, you know, being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3751.982s">[Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people, and we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4678.615s">[Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.158s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.918s">[Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4683.8s">[Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4688.326s">[Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4694.332s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4716.471s">[Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4725.84s">[Belson]</a>: And we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4736.324s">[Belson]</a>: If we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4744.186s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4754.87s">[Belson]</a>: throughout the community and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4766.696s">[Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4773.119s">[Belson]</a>: I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4776.461s">[Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4786.47s">[Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we had two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4793.877s">[Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4795.819s">[Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4803.368s">[Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4806.853s">[Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4812.359s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time It's only been built three times So I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4839.675s">[Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4842.296s">[Belson]</a>: I will leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4845.018s">[Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4882.915s">[Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4896.244s">[Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4897.345s">[Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4898.685s">[Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4900.807s">[Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4902.948s">[Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of, and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4909.734s">[Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency, and I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4923.125s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4928.829s">[Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4934.851s">[Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4936.132s">[Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4937.412s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4943.735s">[Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4945.255s">[Belson]</a>: And Blades, the Bruins bear, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4946.896s">[Belson]</a>: And Pat, the Patriot, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4948.556s">[Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4950.437s">[Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4955.299s">[Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4956.761s">[Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5080.581s">[Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5085.505s">[Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5099.417s">[Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross validate across the various reports and this also plays into the student reporting to homes and homes reporting back to faculty members and the like so it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5115.865s">[Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5121.332s">[Belson]</a>: People can say that why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5123.475s">[Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5124.716s">[Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5132.586s">[Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5134.146s">[Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5154.452s">[Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5157.392s">[Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5159.853s">[Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5229.701s">[Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5303.745s">[Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5307.908s">[Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5327.353s">[Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5333.737s">[Belson]</a>: We have over a thousand people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5337.419s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5347.065s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5349.347s">[Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5351.468s">[Belson]</a>: It just simply is a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5355.751s">[Belson]</a>: Now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5357.612s">[Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5359.074s">[Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5364.118s">[Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5367.661s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5372.765s">[Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5384.034s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5389.618s">[Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5390.859s">[Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5394.441s">[Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5399.104s">[Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5485.084s">[Belson]</a>: So Tony is here and you know I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5491.748s">[Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5492.969s">[Belson]</a>: It's in the globe about concussions and things like this and you know we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5502.876s">[Belson]</a>: You know we'll do this together and there's just a lot of factors about you see in the news today about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5510.25s">[Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5513.211s">[Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5517.273s">[Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well, and it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5527.536s">[Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5531.338s">[Belson]</a>: There's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5532.658s">[Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports, and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5538.155s">[Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5544.9s">[Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that, you know, has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5551.225s">[Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5553.126s">[Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5555.648s">[Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5557.91s">[Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5560.673s">[Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5562.855s">[Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5569.142s">[Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5574.884s">[Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5577.845s">[Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5581.006s">[Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5585.488s">[Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5590.25s">[Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5592.27s">[Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5595.511s">[Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5602.634s">[Belson]</a>: they're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5606.137s">[Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5615.424s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5624.711s">[Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you might have, you're hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5629.435s">[Belson]</a>: You know, a lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5634.538s">[Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5636.479s">[Belson]</a>: And I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5641.703s">[Belson]</a>: But we track this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5643.163s">[Belson]</a>: And I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5645.665s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5794.445s">[Belson]</a>: Well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5800.81s">[Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5803.593s">[Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5816.815s">[Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5821.276s">[Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5845.944s">[Belson]</a>: A better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6043.533s">[Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6048.677s">[Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6051.027s">[Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6055.728s">[Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6060.17s">[Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6235.869s">[Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6239.21s">[Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6243.151s">[Belson]</a>: And there are subpoenas out there for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6245.392s">[Belson]</a>: And we have sent evidence over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6246.592s">[Belson]</a>: And we'll let you know what's going on with that, despite the fact that some people think we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6253.294s">[Belson]</a>: But it's done by the DA's office, not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6257.776s">[Belson]</a>: The second thing is, earlier this evening, a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.077s">[Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.477s">[Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6263.818s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6265.379s">[Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6267.92s">[Belson]</a>: I want to tell you about that because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6271.422s">[Belson]</a>: The Chapter 74 Vocational Advisory Committee on Multimedia met in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6279.229s">[Belson]</a>: There were never postings for those kinds of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6282.01s">[Belson]</a>: It's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6284.531s">[Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6291.955s">[Belson]</a>: But that was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6297.535s">[Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it, but he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6309.617s">[Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings, we've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6320.679s">[Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6322.86s">[Belson]</a>: It's also on the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6326.14s">[Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6328.541s">[Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6331.621s">[Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6339.863s">[Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6342.904s">[Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6345.244s">[Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6363.288s">[Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6365.629s">[Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6367.91s">[Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6382.196s">[Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6387.06s">[Belson]</a>: They sometimes are, the interpretation is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6390.182s">[Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6392.068s">[Belson]</a>: PTOs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6394.689s">[Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6396.31s">[Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6399.552s">[Belson]</a>: I mean, that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6401.592s">[Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6411.838s">[Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6415.803s">[Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are significant to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6426.836s">[Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6464.476s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6484.38s">[Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6497.028s">[Belson]</a>: It's, you know, it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6499.129s">[Belson]</a>: We're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6501.451s">[Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6512.097s">[Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6517.425s">[Belson]</a>: But obviously, it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6595.94s">[Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=187.714s">[Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=202.611s">[Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=215.746s">[Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=218.746s">[Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=219.467s">[Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=221.087s">[Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=226.048s">[Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=228.669s">[Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=317.151s">[Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=322.862s">[Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and check is made out to the conference Okay, cuz yeah, it just strictly for her You know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=335.066s">[Belson]</a>: We now belongs to the Northeast conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=360.51s">[Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=370.135s">[Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=415.091s">[Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=418.633s">[Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=422.556s">[Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=425.398s">[Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=622.293s">[Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=671.208s">[Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=673.529s">[Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=678.567s">[Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=682.229s">[Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=745.537s">[Belson]</a>: So you suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=753.141s">[Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1350.641s">[Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1355.925s">[Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1358.226s">[Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1359.647s">[Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1362.089s">[Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1364.343s">[Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1373.567s">[Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1376.368s">[Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1379.51s">[Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1390.555s">[Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1393.743s">[Belson]</a>: Our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1406.69s">[Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1408.39s">[Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1412.533s">[Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1417.435s">[Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1425.759s">[Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1435.231s">[Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1441.68s">[Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1447.975s">[Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1452.576s">[Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1465.079s">[Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1466.419s">[Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1470.78s">[Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1475.021s">[Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1477.163s">[Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1478.605s">[Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1479.466s">[Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1480.747s">[Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1483.45s">[Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1493.24s">[Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1495.622s">[Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1499.325s">[Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1506.482s">[Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1516.531s">[Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1517.351s">[Belson]</a>: And that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1518.572s">[Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1522.836s">[Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1524.818s">[Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1528.721s">[Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1529.982s">[Belson]</a>: I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1531.323s">[Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1533.405s">[Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1534.866s">[Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.152s">[Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.833s">[Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1543.234s">[Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1544.155s">[Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2315.729s">[Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent so I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate But I can't let one thing go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2326.24s">[Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2333.305s">[Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2339.369s">[Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2344.993s">[Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2347.095s">[Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2348.436s">[Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2354.62s">[Belson]</a>: So ownership, good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2360.024s">[Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2361.405s">[Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2362.405s">[Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2366.008s">[Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2368.85s">[Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2370.111s">[Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2372.232s">[Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2373.833s">[Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2377.776s">[Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2379.037s">[Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2384.616s">[Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2387.397s">[Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2389.617s">[Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2397.299s">[Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2399.039s">[Belson]</a>: You might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2418.86s">[Belson]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2419.92s">[Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2425.002s">[Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2428.444s">[Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2433.486s">[Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2444.17s">[Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3197.765s">[Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3202.109s">[Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3214.398s">[Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3236.449s">[Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way, so this program credit for life is one of the initiatives out of the state Treasurer's Office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so we can have this credit for life there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3266.247s">[Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3277.338s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3630.958s">[Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3648.305s">[Belson]</a>: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3653.532s">[Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3658.468s">[Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3664.675s">[Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3666.697s">[Belson]</a>: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3676.065s">[Belson]</a>: But they like to be associated with that, and I think this is a really important thing, because it not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3680.967s">[Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3690.469s">[Belson]</a>: And we've got to move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3692.209s">[Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3694.349s">[Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3697.13s">[Belson]</a>: A trainer's guide, some selected portions of the whole thing because it would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3701.572s">[Belson]</a>: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3704.173s">[Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports related kind of terminology in it, so like talking trash scenario, the kinds of things like that, or being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3715.138s">[Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3717.839s">[Belson]</a>: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4641.687s">[Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.21s">[Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.991s">[Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4646.874s">[Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4651.4s">[Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4657.407s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might Enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4679.523s">[Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three, because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4688.895s">[Belson]</a>: and we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice if we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4707.266s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4717.953s">[Belson]</a>: throughout the community, and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4729.762s">[Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled, I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4739.531s">[Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4749.541s">[Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4756.949s">[Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4758.892s">[Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4766.442s">[Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4769.926s">[Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4775.433s">[Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4780.135s">[Belson]</a>: It's only been built three times So, I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4802.721s">[Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4805.002s">[Belson]</a>: leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4808.083s">[Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4845.985s">[Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4859.317s">[Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4860.398s">[Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4861.759s">[Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4863.881s">[Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4866.023s">[Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4872.808s">[Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4884.878s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4886.199s">[Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4891.903s">[Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4897.906s">[Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4899.186s">[Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4900.487s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4906.789s">[Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4908.33s">[Belson]</a>: And Blades of Bruins Bear was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4909.971s">[Belson]</a>: And Pat the Patriot was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4911.611s">[Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4913.492s">[Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4918.354s">[Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4919.815s">[Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5014.489s">[Belson]</a>: Is that people at tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5043.67s">[Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5048.574s">[Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5062.506s">[Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5070.208s">[Belson]</a>: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5076.49s">[Belson]</a>: So it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5078.971s">[Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5084.438s">[Belson]</a>: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5086.581s">[Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5087.822s">[Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5095.692s">[Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5097.253s">[Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5117.507s">[Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5120.448s">[Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5122.91s">[Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5193.168s">[Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5266.821s">[Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5270.965s">[Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5290.407s">[Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5296.791s">[Belson]</a>: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5300.493s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5310.119s">[Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5312.401s">[Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5314.522s">[Belson]</a>: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5317.884s">[Belson]</a>: You know, now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5320.645s">[Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5322.126s">[Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5327.168s">[Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5330.71s">[Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5335.812s">[Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5347.097s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5352.679s">[Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5353.92s">[Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5357.861s">[Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5362.183s">[Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5448.12s">[Belson]</a>: So, but Tony is here and you know, I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5454.843s">[Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight, it's in the Globe, about concussions and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5461.005s">[Belson]</a>: And you know, we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving, we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5465.907s">[Belson]</a>: Come on up Tony, you know, we'll do this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5468.328s">[Belson]</a>: And there's just a lot of factors about, you see in the notes today about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5473.31s">[Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5476.291s">[Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5480.351s">[Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5485.092s">[Belson]</a>: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5490.593s">[Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5495.674s">[Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5501.176s">[Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5507.921s">[Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5514.265s">[Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee, things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5516.146s">[Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5518.668s">[Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5520.93s">[Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5523.733s">[Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5525.916s">[Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5532.184s">[Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5537.918s">[Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5540.88s">[Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5544.041s">[Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5548.523s">[Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5553.306s">[Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5555.327s">[Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5558.548s">[Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5565.672s">[Belson]</a>: They're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5569.175s">[Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5578.462s">[Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5587.749s">[Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5592.513s">[Belson]</a>: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5597.595s">[Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up, and I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5604.878s">[Belson]</a>: We track this every year, and I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5608.5s">[Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5747.279s">[Belson]</a>: By the way, over the three-year period, there were 58 different identifications of concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5754.924s">[Belson]</a>: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5763.851s">[Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5766.613s">[Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5780.137s">[Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5783.42s">[Belson]</a>: She'd have to go through the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5784.301s">[Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5808.51s">[Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6006.572s">[Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6011.716s">[Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6014.045s">[Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6018.769s">[Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6023.212s">[Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6198.92s">[Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6202.261s">[Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court and you know there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over and we'll let you know what's going on with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6211.983s">[Belson]</a>: Despite the fact that some people think you know we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6216.344s">[Belson]</a>: But we don't, it's done by the DA's office not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6219.925s">[Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6220.785s">[Belson]</a>: The second thing is early this evening a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.066s">[Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.926s">[Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6226.887s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6228.368s">[Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law, I'm gonna tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6234.41s">[Belson]</a>: The chapter 74 vocational advisory committee on multimedia met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6240.733s">[Belson]</a>: In the past, there were never postings for those kinds of meetings, it's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6247.536s">[Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6254.962s">[Belson]</a>: But it was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6260.538s">[Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6265.439s">[Belson]</a>: But he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6272.601s">[Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6278.683s">[Belson]</a>: We've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6283.685s">[Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6285.865s">[Belson]</a>: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6289.126s">[Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6291.548s">[Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6294.611s">[Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6302.878s">[Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6305.9s">[Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6308.242s">[Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6326.114s">[Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6328.656s">[Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6330.937s">[Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6343.946s">[Belson]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6345.228s">[Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6350.096s">[Belson]</a>: They sometimes are interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6353.221s">[Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6355.089s">[Belson]</a>: PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6357.71s">[Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6359.311s">[Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6362.572s">[Belson]</a>: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6364.633s">[Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6374.875s">[Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6378.84s">[Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6389.875s">[Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6427.479s">[Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6447.401s">[Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6461.704s">[Belson]</a>: It's hard, we're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6464.445s">[Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6475.111s">[Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6480.435s">[Belson]</a>: But you know, obviously it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6559.201s">[Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can designate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=244.673s">[Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=245.993s">[Belson]</a>: We, Mustangs, are with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=247.933s">[Belson]</a>: From us to you, we support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=286.744s">[Belson]</a>: From the Medford Mustang softball team to the Kingwood Mustang softball team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=292.591s">[Belson]</a>: It's winning.<br><br>
