 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1044.623s">I'm</a> Nicole Branly, and I'm currently serving my first term as a school committee member and running for re-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1052.007s">I</a> have worked diligently during my first term to learn, to listen, and to use my voice for our staff, our students, families, and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1061.652s">I'm</a> proud to have been educated in Medford Public Schools, graduating from Medford High School, and I'm proud of both my daughter, who just graduated this year from Medford High, and my son, who's currently a 10th grader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1073.527s">I</a> have been both a cheerleader and a critic to Medford Public Schools, advocating for what is best for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1080.495s">I</a> have worked in public education for nearly a decade, with six of those years as a paraprofessional here in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1087.658s">Currently,</a> I work, like other candidates, in Somerville Special Education Department for nearly three years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1098.204s">I</a> have been honored to walk into City Hall to represent all of our city as an independent thinking school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1105.991s">I'm</a> not a politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1107.292s">I</a> am a mom who ran for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1110.094s">I</a> won a grassroots campaign and I want to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1113.097s">No</a> one should walk into City Hall for themselves, but for the people of this city and for me focusing on our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1122.69s">I</a> want to continue the important work we do and be part of the decisions that will mold our future, most notably choosing a new superintendent in the future of our Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1136.515s">No</a> one job in public education is more important than the next, because at the end of the day, it's about a student, someone's child, and what happens in our schools spills directly into our neighborhoods, and that affects us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1149.699s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2406.766s">I'll</a> get the worst question ever.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2435.153s">Okay,</a> can you read the question one more time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2436.594s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2456.151s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2457.462s">Well,</a> as a mom of a teenager, two teenagers, one in high school and one in college, technology should really be enhancing our learning, not replacing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2468.731s">We</a> need to use digital tools to expand opportunities, but balance with the human connection and hands-on experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2475.876s">We</a> need students to actually be thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2479.519s">We</a> talked a lot about AI in one of our previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2483.921s">I</a> believe that's definitely a double-edged sword. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2487.504s">Access</a> to phones for research, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2490.766s">Access</a> to phones for Snapchat during school, probably not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2495.128s">I</a> think it's important that kids are focused on their teachers, they're focused on the curriculum, and that they're focused on learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2501.873s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3757.908s">I</a> hope so.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3790.678s">Well,</a> as a current school's commit, school committee member, I think we already do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3797.101s">We</a> get a lot of feedback, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3802.739s">from</a> our constituents, lots of emails, lots of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3807.201s">I</a> think it's really important to have discussions to explain where we come from as a committee, as a school, as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3817.565s">We</a> really need to support our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3819.926s">I</a> don't think every policy and every motion that we pass makes everybody happy all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3828.93s">I</a> think we really need to find a middle ground <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3832.132s">to</a> really support as many students as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3834.733s">Because</a> at the end of the day, this is what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3836.955s">It's</a> about the students, it's about the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3840.036s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4917.498s">Can</a> you just read that one more time, because we've been talking about food this whole time, and I'm just laughing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4921.001s">That</a> ended up being my question.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4930.035s">Well,</a> I have to give a big shout out to Retta Smith, who is our food director here at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4936.956s">She</a> has really been a game changer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4940.737s">She</a> truly has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4942.537s">I</a> worked at the Brooks for six years, and I remember when Retta would come and bring samples. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4946.958s">The</a> teachers were lining up for Retta's food. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4950.459s">She</a> really has changed, I think, the face of Medford Public Schools food. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4958.04s">As</a> a para, when I did lunch duty, I would always know when it was French toast stick day because it was a run on the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4969.465s">I</a> knew when other things were being served and everybody was kind of hanging out waiting for a slice of pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4975.188s">So,</a> nutrition and learning go hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4979.071s">I</a> believe healthy, appealing school meals are part of academic success, and that every student deserves access to them without a stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4987.797s">A</a> full belly is a full mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4991.24s">And</a> I know even my high school student is eating school lunch every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4996.163s">and</a> always knows what he had for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4999.146s">Oh,</a> mom, we had this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5000.167s">We</a> had this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5001.008s">And</a> I feel like if it was just that, you know, pizza and Doritos or tater tots that I ate when I was here at Medford High, it probably wouldn't be discussed as much as it is at our own dinner table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5010.216s">So</a> I'm really grateful for the strides that we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5012.458s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5119.488s">I</a> don't want to answer another question.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5558.776s">So</a> thank you all for being here tonight, for watching and listening from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5563.318s">I'm</a> grateful to the Medford Democratic City Committee for this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5568.061s">I</a> want to thank my fellow school committee colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5571.402s">Serving</a> with you has been quite an honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5573.383s">And</a> all of you running for office for the first time, as I know firsthand the guts, the time, and the commitment that this really takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5581.727s">I</a> bring a unique aspect to the role of a school committee member, have been educated here, a lifelong member of our community, worked in our schools, being a parent of a current student and one who has graduated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5595.149s">I</a> work in public education every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5599.15s">Medford</a> runs deep within me, and I have been so grateful for the support of this city, for myself, for my family, and this truly feels, this position is an amazing way to give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5611.192s">I</a> show up and I will continue to show up moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5615.715s">I</a> vowed back in 2022 to do anything I could to step up for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5624.123s">and</a> our staff, and I have done just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5627.545s">I'm</a> a woman of my word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5628.546s">I</a> have a listening ear, and I believe that's truly what our public school system needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5634.35s">We</a> need to work together as a community to ensure every child has the opportunity they deserve to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5640.535s">They</a> need someone that is invested in Medford, who can work on issues affecting our city and its families and move us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5647.46s">It</a> would be a great honor to earn your vote, and not one that I have ever taken for granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5651.943s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-10-08_9XNxJ6SowDU/2025-10-08_9XNxJ6SowDU.html">Rules and Policy Subcommittee- Management of Life-Threatening Allergies Policy.</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1871.935s">So</a> I think I just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1874.937s">If</a> we were to sever part of the responsibilities, all of these boxes of what everybody is going to do, where do we put it and how do we enforce it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1885.502s">Is</a> there really a way to enforce it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1886.923s">I</a> mean, as it being guidance?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1894.734s">We're</a> kind of doing it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1896.154s">And</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1896.775s">Probably</a> not to this extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1898.236s">I</a> mean, I was a para. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1899.756s">So,</a> you know, that was always a topic of conversation, especially in the classroom day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1906.44s">We</a> we always I don't think there was ever a class that didn't have an allergy of some sort in there and having snack, especially as kindergartners in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1915.865s">It</a> was something that was, you know, the topic at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1918.386s">I</a> check snacks as a para just to make sure everybody was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1923.087s">So,</a> I mean, I guess to have some sort of guidance is great because I think sometimes we do lack that with, you know, lots of different things, you know, like you kind of get put in a position and you're like, OK, this is what I'm doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1935.669s">But</a> how do we separate maybe these boxes of responsibilities for people without violating anything in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1945.576s">CBAs,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1947.597s">How</a> do we incorporate all of this to be good guidance, but a really crisp policy on its own?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=3160.272s">I</a> mean, obviously some of this is going to overlap too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=3163.074s">So</a> if we took the graphics out and just put the wording, although I do love the graphics, but if it can't be in the policy, let the graphics and the wording be in the guidance where at least the wording is in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=3174.963s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=3175.704s">Cause</a> I think the graphic is awesome.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4054.667s">Oh,</a> that might very well be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4057.428s">I'm</a> just saying what I experienced in my classroom.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4068.002s">Yeah,</a> and even to Jen's point too, just one sec, Dr. Gosey, like I remember even being as a para and they should be, you know, when we did have like a movie day before holiday break or winter break, you know, we would have like the popcorn time, you know, popcorn day, whatever, but we would talk <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4087.081s">to</a> each family, we would have them sign a little something, you know, and that was always approved by the principal, you know, but I'm not sure we went by any specific policy either. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4097.967s">So,</a> you know, I think that we do have to make sure that we're following something here, you know, that everybody's gonna do universally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=4107.111s">Now,</a> if they're following through with it, that's another story, you know what I mean, but.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=5697.847s">Yes,</a> I'm here.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7958.21s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9081.022s">Member</a> Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9081.683s">In</a> my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9084.677s">I</a> think that this is gonna get really tricky as time goes on because I think maybe a discussion with the principal in one building with a parent is gonna be different maybe than a principal in another building with a parent just based on what the parent's needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9098.12s">And</a> I just, I feel this tornado happening of social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9107.922s">Well,</a> this is what happened here and this was our situation here and every case is gonna be case by case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9113.556s">So</a> I just feel like this is going to really open up a door to a lot of stormy waters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9119.54s">I</a> think everybody has the right to obviously be able to make the decision for their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9127.085s">But</a> I think even as she said, moving forward as your older children, how do we protect a student? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9137.498s">from</a> being, you know, chastised or, you know, like, I mean, where are we drawing the line here? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9141.4s">Like,</a> this is really opening up a broad, a broad purview that we're really can't control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9148.664s">I</a> mean, this is like, the more I'm hearing about this, I'm like, oh gee, this is gonna be tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9156.028s">This</a> is gonna be tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9157.549s">I</a> don't think it's as easy as just saying like, okay, you don't sit in math during this lesson and you can go for a walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9165.976s">I</a> would say for appropriate, like, I mean, like you said, sorry, not to trip you, but like, even like kindergarten, we won't let you go in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9172.12s">Oh,</a> well, we'll be like, what is, what is going to be the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9175.482s">Like,</a> this is such a broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9177.203s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9179.224s">Really</a> broad.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9274.437s">I</a> just want to make sure that our principals and our staff, along with Dr. Talbot, are really being supported in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9282.279s">Because</a> at the end of the day, as I always say, it's about the kids at the end of the day and supporting their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9286.801s">So</a> it's really going to have to be individual and discussion-based.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9939.883s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9941.984s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11724.913s">I</a> just looked at the website knowing that I'm on that superintendent evaluation <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11733.748s">member</a> Olapati as the chair, but it says his name twice on our website instead of a third member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11740.272s">So</a> who, I'm assuming it's either.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11744.334s">Intoppa,</a> okay, perfect.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11755.8s">And</a> then I had just asked Will if he could update the webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11759.882s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11760.745s">with</a> that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11763.907s">We</a> had that talk earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11764.788s">I</a> was like, I can send you an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11765.989s">I</a> know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11766.389s">And</a> then we could just, since I'm on this and I had already asked him if we could just update the voting and non-voting members on the MSBA process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11772.734s">Those</a> aren't updated also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11773.854s">So</a> if we could just add that to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11775.776s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11776.256s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-23_Z6zl2TiJ9bc/2025-07-23_Z6zl2TiJ9bc.html">Medford Happenings w/ Nicole Branley</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=343.206s">There's</a> a lot going on and I'd like to stay apart and see everything through.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=979.402s">Yeah,</a> you know, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=981.363s">And</a> I think mine was 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=982.823s">I</a> don't even know how many was in my daughter's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=986.045s">But,</a> you know, overall, enrollment has declined. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=988.306s">People's</a> families have shrunk, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=990.687s">People</a> don't have six kids anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=992.468s">It's</a> too expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=994.589s">So</a> obviously, enrollment goes down over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=997.33s">So,</a> you know, we'd have to tailor it to what the enrollment projections are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1002.118s">So</a> yeah, all of that goes into it.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1019.216s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1022.159s">Absolutely.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1217.831s">I'm</a> around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1218.411s">I'm</a> in Medford.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1242.07s">Okay,</a> so I would say my least favorite thing to do in Medford is drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1247.376s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1249.125s">The</a> traffic, you know, I work in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1252.028s">It</a> takes me sometimes 45 minutes to get to Somerville from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1255.211s">I</a> think days I could walk quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1256.813s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1258.334s">You</a> know, everybody has different modes of transportation, which is great, but it's a lot, you know, so it's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1265.542s">So,</a> yeah, I think probably driving is probably my least favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1269.245s">I</a> think you have to give a lot more time when you're even just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1273.644s">Just</a> going local. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1274.306s">Just</a> going local. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1275.108s">You</a> have to give yourself a little bit extra time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1277.013s">So</a> probably driving is my least favorite.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1296.704s">It's</a> incredible, and just so you know, there's still traffic on Winthrop Street, even when school is out, because I sit in that some days, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z6zl2TiJ9bc&t=1304.007s">And</a> I don't know what's going on with Tuesdays, but Tuesdays is not a good traffic day ever.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1148.627s">So</a> this year I understand the situation with the class of 2025 and then MCAS participation student participation is required so every student in the district is taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1160.359s">That</a> hasn't changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1162.539s">Participation</a> is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1164.32s">The</a> reason that I say that is because I think you see that a lot on social media circulating that MCATs are not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1168.541s">Oh,</a> just write a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1169.281s">They</a> don't have to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1170.821s">And</a> I don't think that that's fair to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1174.362s">I</a> mean, you know, I also understand the need of a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1177.163s">So</a> like, how do we- That's the clarifier.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1187.629s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1206.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1206.574s">And</a> I think that there's maybe this, you know, notion that, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1212.394s">It's</a> not a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1213.494s">It</a> is a requirement for every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1215.935s">So</a> I just think that that should be known to the public that it's a requirement for the student, but the student won't be held back from graduation or some of the things that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1227.859s">for</a> the student, but also it's necessary for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1230.6s">And</a> I think maybe if people feel like they don't have to put so much pressure on their child or their child doesn't have to feel so much pressure, I think that's just good to get out there because, you know, it's more our rating versus a student's rating overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1244.143s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1246.004s">That</a> part is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1246.764s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1247.044s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1247.524s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2604.645s">I</a> think that that was just clarified my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2606.267s">So</a> there's someone coming from the EL program to help Mr. Petralas every afternoon with these 40 extra children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2613.233s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2613.613s">Do</a> we think that's enough people?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2636.317s">So</a> are they in charge of, Mr. Petrellis just mentioned, you know, tutoring and all of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2643.262s">Is</a> that something that they're responsible for? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2644.603s">It</a> seems like he's taking care of that part.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6091.731s">I'm</a> just wondering, I was lucky enough not to have to do summer camps for my kids when they were little. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6097.073s">It</a> was more fun versus necessity because I was home. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6101.395s">But</a> do most summer programs have a sliding scale or is it just a set tuition? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6109.999s">Anybody</a> know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6110.899s">I</a> really don't know the answer, so I'm really asking.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6586.462s">I</a> mean, I understand for afterschool, that's a way bigger system, so someone is working on that, but who's deciding the sliding scale here? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6593.43s">Who's</a> putting the work in to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6594.692s">You?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6598.868s">Mayor,</a> you raised your hand, that's why I said you, in case someone didn't see that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6611.512s">Yeah,</a> so wouldn't it just be easier to have this one price increase instead of trying to go low, trying to go high? <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6618.294s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6618.634s">We</a> need a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6620.675s">We've</a> made it clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6621.715s">Mr.</a> Petrellis is clearly working his heart and soul out here, definitely needs an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6627.23s">in</a> pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6628.231s">So</a> set it at one amount, we're already economical.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7895.857s">So</a> I just wanted to say you had made a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7898.238s">You</a> said our community, but I want you to know you're part of our community that we are all one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7903.62s">And</a> that includes you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7904.861s">That</a> includes every child in this district and every single parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7909.042s">I</a> work in special ed in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7910.483s">I've</a> never made that a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7912.444s">I</a> love working for special ed because I say this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7916.945s">And</a> I think that sometimes there's this, you know, differential. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7920.407s">I</a> don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7922.327s">I</a> don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7923.068s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7924.589s">And</a> I feel like everybody in special ed, every student, every adult, everybody that works in special ed, every student in the district, every student outside of special ed, we're all a piece to a puzzle here in this room and everywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7940.12s">And</a> at the end of the day, the pieces of that puzzle get put together and it's your child's name, you know, and that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7947.265s">And</a> I take it really personal because I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7951.809s">You</a> are part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7953.15s">So</a> I just never want anybody to ever forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7955.831s">So</a> thank you for coming and advocating for your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7957.872s">I've</a> stood there and advocated for my own child. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7959.893s">I</a> know how difficult that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7961.694s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7962.314s">Thank</a> you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7963.515s">And</a> I will be at city council tomorrow to support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7965.676s">So</a> thank you very much.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10495.618s">Okay,</a> well, first, I'd like to thank you for all your hard work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10499.1s">I</a> appreciate it very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10500.541s">Also,</a> I'd like to thank the custodians who are cleaning the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10504.123s">They're</a> definitely unsung heroes on the day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10508.385s">Question,</a> when that plumbing emergency happens, where does that come out of, money-wise?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10517.711s">Facility</a> repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10518.751s">And</a> so, obviously, that's a huge dollar amount that we're not budgeting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10526.162s">I'm</a> assuming, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10527.363s">I</a> mean, I don't, as much as I budget at home, you know, I had a sink that was clogged for three weeks and it was, you know, impossible and it costs a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10537.83s">So</a> I can only imagine the depth of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10540.492s">So</a> that is really disappointing to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10543.093s">And</a> I'm really curious why boys more than girls, like a girl's throwing this in the trash and boys are just flushing it because it's, I don't know.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10554.403s">Hey,</a> yeah, that's very interesting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10559.905s">Yeah,</a> I think it's imperative that we have the bathroom staffed so we can open as many safely as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10567.527s">So</a> definitely two staff members looks like it would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10571.588s">So</a> thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10572.988s">And</a> just really a big thank you to everybody who's cleaning the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10578.33s">I</a> hate cleaning my own bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10580.07s">So</a> I can't imagine a bunch of teenage boys. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10582.731s">I</a> have one, that's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10584.386s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11198.362s">Just</a> one question on the angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11200.744s">Some</a> areas need more video monitors and then others just need the angle changed?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11217.005s">OK,</a> so that seems is that I feel like that's an easy fix, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11222.048s">I'm</a> also five feet tall, a little less now, but I can't reach them, but like, how does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11228.13s">Like,</a> how can we get, can that part be something that's fixed that might not even cost money?<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4/2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4.html">11.18.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7927.726s">So</a> I have a whole bunch of notes because I'm a big fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7930.067s">So</a> I am honored enough to be on the advisory board for the vocational school through the culinary program through my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7937.689s">And</a> we had a meeting last week, the first one of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7942.411s">I</a> believe there was 120 in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7945.412s">There</a> wasn't a seat at the bistro to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7947.673s">We</a> were looking for seats for which were together were parents, business owners in the community, staff members and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7957.595s">And</a> to look around that room and to see how much like really love was in the room was really overwhelming to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7965.758s">For</a> the culinary program, there was the executive chef for Earl's Kitchen, the owner of Goldilocks Bagels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7973.3s">There</a> was an owner of, I can't remember all the things this gentleman did, but he was a friend of Chef C and he owned food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7983.444s">But</a> these people came out to, you know, listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7987.495s">The</a> students talk and show around the bistro and it was very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=7992.702s">You</a> also gave out an award, and I believe it was the first award so I just want to know if you could tell everybody about that because I thought that was really cool.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8058.08s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8058.48s">And</a> I think it's amazing how many business owners were at that meeting that, that night and whether they're in the community or, you know, in the area and it, that group, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8069.833s">got</a> up and I believe there was one already graduate from Medford High and one student from Medford High that was working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8076.179s">And</a> I just think it's really nice to recognize them to say like, you are taking this risk and we appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8083.125s">And</a> there were just so many business owners there and so many people that you recognize from in the community that you're like, oh, she's a hairdresser. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8089.07s">Oh,</a> I know her from the elementary school or the local daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8094.355s">And</a> it was just really, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8096.016s">I</a> think it's really a nice night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8098.278s">And</a> I think more people need to know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8099.939s">Because</a> if you aren't a vocational parent, you wouldn't know that that's on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8106.424s">Just</a> a few things that I think about in my spare time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8111.828s">I</a> think there's still a myth about the vocational school that I graduated Medford High 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8118.754s">I'm</a> going to my reunion at the end of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8120.935s">And</a> you really went to the Vogue if there wasn't a great path for you academically. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8126.636s">And</a> I think there is this myth that parents still say, Oh no, I want my daughter to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8132.54s">So</a> she's not, she's not going to go to the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8134.582s">And</a> I think maybe that's what member Graham was sort of mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8137.164s">Like</a> there are so many paths that include, you know, academics that I think that that is lost on some of, I don't know, I don't want to say the world, but definitely not just metric specific that <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8153.55s">You</a> can go to the Vogue, and you are going to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8156.651s">It's</a> not just, you know, some of the programs are certainly more towards getting into a union or whatever, but I think that so many of them are also geared towards going to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8167.354s">And</a> so I think bridging that gap between the high school and the Vogue is so imperative because <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8173.325s">We</a> do need kids to take language still. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8175.326s">We</a> still need kids to explore other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8177.727s">And</a> so obviously that's not just on you, of course, but just something that I think that we need to be aware of, that we need to get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8186.791s">And</a> I also am wondering, you do have to keep up your academics, correct, to stay in your shop.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8195.28s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8195.7s">And</a> so I think that people just feel like if you're there, it's because you are not excelling in academics, but it's actually the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8202.383s">You</a> need to keep up your academics.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8225.535s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8227.417s">Do</a> you know if students' attendance on a day-to-day basis is higher if you're in the vocational program?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8235.084s">Just</a> curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8236.845s">And</a> I'm always impressed that the academic teachers, and I noticed it a lot this year at curriculum night, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8244.255s">how</a> supportive the staff is to the vocational students, and I think it's really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8250.121s">They</a> know that obviously the academics are priority, but they're talking about these students that are, they know that they're out at work, that they're doing co-op, that they're trying to tailor their teaching style to <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8263.666s">really</a> incorporate what these kids love. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8266.226s">And</a> I think that that was so great to see in science and math and English, you know, these different academics that they want these kids to excel and still really be, you know, workers in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8279.309s">And</a> I think that that was like a nice thing that I hear every year that the staff says, you know, like how important they know the voc is to these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8288.91s">Someone</a> also mentioned to me how they feel like the behaviors of the vocationals <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8293.609s">school</a> students is better because they're busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8301.075s">Their</a> hands are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8302.836s">Their</a> minds are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8303.837s">And</a> I even know in my house that there's never a question about wanting to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8308.393s">You</a> know, there's never a question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8310.334s">Like,</a> I can't, I can't miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8312.334s">You</a> know, I can't miss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8313.835s">No,</a> it's this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8314.555s">It's,</a> you know, my daughter chopped 30 pounds of onions today in goggles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8321.017s">She's</a> never done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8322.037s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8322.517s">Where</a> do you see the picture? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8323.638s">I</a> won't show it publicly, but it was, it's awesome that, you know, there was no complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8334.718s">You</a> know, she came home and she's like, I gotta get my shower smell like onions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8337.081s">I'm</a> like, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8339.163s">But,</a> but I think that they do things that are so out of the element, but because they love their shop, they want to, they want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8347.193s">And</a> I think that that's such a great incentive to come to school every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8350.937s">And,</a> you know, never wanting to be late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8353.2s">I</a> think that that is <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8355.56s">Not</a> that I would think going to school to chop onions is more exciting than going to school to do math. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8360.804s">But</a> on the day-to-day basis, I think these kids are coming to school because they love what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8365.967s">And</a> I think that that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8367.108s">And</a> so I just want to compliment you on that and the staff at the Vogue, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8371.651s">Let</a> me think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8372.151s">What</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8373.592s">I</a> want to congratulate you, too, because you mentioned in the meeting the other day that not only are you the director and obviously the principal of a vocational school, but you're also managing 15 <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8385.04s">Am</a> I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8386.0s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8386.38s">Businesses.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8530.653s">And</a> I think that your staff is so engaged and I love how they collaborate with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8535.595s">That</a> makes me so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8537.196s">I</a> mean, I remember coming to look at the book last year and going into biotech and feeling like I was in a different world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8547.481s">They</a> were amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8549.101s">They</a> were amazing in biotech. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8550.582s">And</a> I loved how last year they, I hope I say this right, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8555.146s">biotech</a> was taking the oil from culinary and changing it into glycerin and then also taking some to make the gasoline or the diesel for the, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8569.449s">Am</a> I right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8569.849s">Am</a> I on track there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8570.769s">And</a> then there was something to do with, yeah, with the welding shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8574.11s">And</a> I'm like, this is so cool that they're all working together.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8585.566s">We</a> need a shop to take care of that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8588.515s">It's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8589.899s">I'm</a> doing all I can to promote <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8591.926s">the</a> culinary program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8593.367s">I</a> think everybody sees all my delicious food that gets taken back to some of the public schools, or that I'm having for lunch or taking home for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8601.012s">But</a> it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8601.712s">And</a> it's so affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8602.853s">And</a> I think that people don't realize how affordable I mean, I walk out of there with $40 worth of food, but I'm feeding the Somerville special ed office, I'm having lunch for the rest of the week.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8617.236s">I</a> don't believe they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8618.297s">We</a> get a lot of emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8619.798s">Mr.</a> Pantidose is the CTE director over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8622.901s">Their</a> menu looks great too, but a little partial over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8626.563s">But</a> no, it's awesome, so thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8631.667s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8632.127s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8632.468s">I</a> love it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4/2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4.html">City Council 11-12-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2729.916s">Nicole</a> Bramley, 54 North Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2732.619s">I</a> am a current member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2735.021s">And</a> when I saw this, I was a little surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2738.023s">So</a> I'm happy that it's been revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2739.384s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2739.785s">I</a> think it going to committee to be talked about further is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2744.709s">But</a> I would just like to have some of these things kept in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2749.983s">I</a> did ask Mr. South if he wanted me to go first, maybe I should have went first. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2755.626s">I</a> just wanted to remind everybody that as I took office in January, our salary was $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2764.03s">We</a> received a $5,000 raise come July 1st, and we'll receive another $5,000 raise next July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2767.211s">So</a> our salary will go from 12,000 to 22,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2779.241s">that</a> is our part-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2781.626s">It</a> is not lost on me as an elected official here in this city that we are considered part-time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2787.918s">right,</a> but we are, you know, asked to be at everybody's beck and call 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2794.539s">And</a> that's not lost on me, especially being on this side of the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2801.021s">I've</a> stood here for years talking, but you do have a different perspective when you cross the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2808.602s">People</a> reach out to you on a Sunday, like many of you may be talking about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2813.243s">motion,</a> this resolution, like Councilor Scarpelli, I too have received a lot of calls and people inquiring about this, this resolution and, you know, people expect you to be there when when they send the email they expect you to be there on a Sunday if if they don't like what they see when they when they read the, you know, the paperwork for the meetings so that's not lost on me that we are part time employees, but <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2840.823s">You</a> know, people do want you to show up all the time and I and I can respect that because I expected it when I was here, demanding change. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2848.845s">So,</a> I think, going into committee, I don't know if I'm at three minutes but I'm being really nice so just keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2855.367s">So</a> just want to also remind people that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2862.95s">There</a> are a lot of unions in the city, as Councilor Scarpelli said, that don't have raises, that are fighting, I think, close to three years for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2874.373s">The</a> fire department went three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2875.954s">Other</a> unions in the city that don't have raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2879.495s">I</a> sit in those executive sessions where we talk about contracts regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2883.596s">It</a> is not fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2885.777s">Budget</a> season is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2891.095s">It's</a> really horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2893.417s">I</a> lost a lot of sleep and I don't feel comfortable that we would get any more raises or anything else put forward for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2901.724s">So</a> just to keep in mind that, you know, if the line of COLA or anything else that gets put forward for an elected official matches, no more then. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2915.222s">what</a> other unions in the city would get. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2917.183s">I</a> don't think that we need anything more, but I think that if unions are getting 2% or 1%, that we should not get anything more than that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2928.808s">So</a> I just wanna make sure that that is brought up and talked about and kept in mind for your future meetings.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6108.078s">Hi,</a> so I agree that the bathroom situation is not ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6113.38s">I</a> don't believe that it is as horrible as it is portrayed by some. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6120.002s">This</a> is the schedule that was taken off of, hold on, where am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6124.683s">Off</a> the door today. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6126.924s">This</a> is the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6129.125s">And</a> if the staff that are actually on the ground at the high school could, <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6134.144s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong, but this is on the doors at the high school on the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6138.13s">So</a> you have availability of all of these bathrooms all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6142.315s">Is</a> it great? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6143.477s">No,</a> it's not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6144.839s">We</a> also have, I think, too many bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6147.934s">And</a> I think in a new high school, we wouldn't have as many bathrooms also. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6150.975s">I</a> know that that's not the situation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6153.937s">I</a> reached out to nursing staff at Medford High, security at Medford High, custodians at Medford High, teachers at the high school and at the Volk. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6162.86s">And</a> I also reached out to staff over at Somerville High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6166.822s">And</a> these are the things that I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6168.822s">More</a> bathrooms equal more hangout spots, not supervised at all times because there's just not enough people. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6176.141s">Bathrooms</a> that are open aren't enough, but who's going to man them? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6180.064s">We're</a> already spread thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6182.206s">All</a> bathrooms during lunch are locked, besides the calf bathrooms, but it's only a 30-second walk, I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6189.713s">Bathroom</a> schedule is always posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6191.454s">B</a> and A buildings probably have the biggest inconvenience during lunchtime, not any other time. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6198.925s">Bathrooms</a> are in better shape overall this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6202.726s">Kids</a> do clog the toilets, can't have them open all the time, everywhere, because there's just not enough staff to secure them. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6210.307s">Graffiti</a> this year has been minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6212.888s">Vape</a> detectors were pulled down, the majority of them, within the first couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6218.809s">I</a> don't know if they've been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6221.269s">Main</a> office for students, the bathroom is always available. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6225.685s">general</a> gender neutral bathrooms, third floor C building, always open, open all day based on this schedule and based on what I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6235.593s">Third</a> floor and lunch ones need monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6239.016s">Everybody's</a> doing the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6240.718s">And</a> these are quotes from staff that are there every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6244.32s">Nurse</a> bathroom is for emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6246.222s">It</a> is available, but obviously students with 504 plans and medical plans access, they are the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6258.905s">Four</a> sets of bathrooms open, ABC, Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6261.767s">That</a> was a suggestion by someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6264.389s">Four</a> full-time monitors, sign kids in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6268.493s">That's</a> not realistic, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6270.654s">Ideal?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6271.315s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6271.735s">In</a> an ideal world, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6273.577s">But</a> that's probably not realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6275.498s">The</a> current situation does need improvement, but opening every bathroom would never work. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6281.235s">So</a> I just wanted to give my feedback of everybody that I spoke to, like I said, nursing staff, security staff, custodians, teachers at both the high school and the voc. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6290.581s">And</a> I spoke to some of the high school today, here we are, a high school right that went through what we hope to go through an old high school that had too many spots to a new high school that has <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6302.205s">little</a> bit more tailored to the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6304.487s">Um,</a> and there's a lot of single stall bathrooms at the new Somerville high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6308.65s">Um,</a> there's still monitors in those bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6311.752s">Um,</a> so yes, things need to get better, but in asking students, even that I know, I'm like, do you know what bathroom to go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6320.018s">They're</a> like, Oh yeah, it's posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6321.579s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6322.86s">And</a> could even name them to me off the top of their head. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6325.822s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6328.539s">Do</a> we need to do better? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6329.499s">Yes,</a> I would never say that we're at 100%, but I definitely think that for safety concerns, top of the priority, the bathrooms that are open are what we can manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6343.383s">And</a> still, it's not 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6345.444s">So</a> if we have six sets of bathrooms open, or three sets of bathrooms open, or 12 sets of bathrooms open, <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6353.055s">does</a> it really allow that many more students to use the toilet or does it allow that many more students to hang out? <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6360.267s">This</a> is my concern also. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6362.009s">So</a> that's my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6364.353s">I</a> look forward to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6366.112s">I'm</a> happy to know that there is some money, hopefully somewhere that we can help do some renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6371.274s">I</a> know that there was some renovations done to bathrooms and that the conditions in the bathrooms themselves are a little better, but it is not lost on me that I'm going to my reunion this year of 30 years in those of the bathrooms that used. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6383.914s">So</a> that's not lost on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6385.175s">It's</a> gross. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6387.077s">But</a> some of that is going to have to be what we look forward to for a new Medford High, what we're envisioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6393.602s">So</a> what we're doing now, I think we're doing the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6397.505s">And</a> I just want to thank everybody who takes the time during the day to check those bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6402.731s">to</a> send kids back to their classrooms, the custodians who are cleaning up the bathrooms, the security monitors who are sending kids back to class, the nursing staff who is trying to accommodate everybody on 504 plans, and anybody else that needs the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6420.237s">So</a> a big shout out to everybody that's doing the work on the ground there. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6424.518s">So</a> thanks.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10077.076s">And</a> so then just my other question is, would this be something that's done after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10082.965s">When</a> would we be painting if that was the case? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10085.389s">Do</a> you have any ideas, Mr. Casey?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10106.187s">And</a> obviously the school is being used during that time too, for activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10116.252s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10118.629s">Do</a> we have to motion on the floor to make this two separate votes, 175 for the spot and then 175 for the painting? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10125.951s">If</a> somebody wants to sever, otherwise we can move approval of the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10129.792s">I'd</a> like to sever it so that we can have motion to sever the $75 for the spot and then $75 for the painting, if that's possible.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10992.044s">So</a> I just have a question on number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10994.646s">If</a> we eliminate the MCAS as the standard, then what are we using as a requirement for competency to graduate? <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11001.13s">So</a> it moves to the district to define student competencies.<h2><a href="../2024-09-10_qepI_nDiY5s/2024-09-10_qepI_nDiY5s.html">Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8382.061s">Thank</a> you, Member Bramley. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8385.344s">I</a> just want to agree with Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8388.146s">The</a> proactive word was used, and I feel like we are a district that is constantly reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8393.274s">And</a> it's aggravating. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8395.475s">It's</a> aggravating to see that I feel like in so many different aspects, we react to things that happen instead of being proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8401.477s">And</a> I would love to hop on board to anybody that wants to be proactive because I'll come to every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8405.799s">But</a> let's be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8407.12s">We</a> know school's going to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8408.36s">We</a> know it's going to be warm. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8409.861s">We</a> know that, you know, it's going to get cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8412.602s">Like,</a> we know these things are going to happen, yet we're always shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8416.203s">And</a> it blows my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8418.344s">And</a> yet I don't know why I'm surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8420.565s">So</a> I think if we could be proactive, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8423.564s">we</a> know kids are gonna take the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8425.686s">I</a> was a parent that always filled out that, oh yeah, we live here and we're gonna take the bus to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8434.212s">I</a> don't know why we always end up in a predicament like this and it's for more than one subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8439.216s">And</a> it's just like member Graham said, being proactive, we know school's gonna start next year, we know we need the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8445.681s">And</a> obviously there's some stuff that we can't control in many different aspects, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8449.724s">this</a> seems something that we can control. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8451.705s">So</a> I know that you said that you had a meeting coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8454.847s">I</a> would love to join you because I think that this is imperative that, you know, two weeks into school that we're telling parents, well, now we can't take your kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8462.372s">Well,</a> you know, and you said, well, we're not going to leave your child out, you know, if it's unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8468.496s">Who's</a> going to make that judgment? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8470.497s">You?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8471.638s">I'm</a> not saying that you can't, but is the parent going to make that judgment? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8474.359s">Well,</a> I don't think my child can cross Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8476.681s">Oh,</a> well, it's only a mile, so they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8479.275s">don't</a> think that's fair who's who's to say whose child is more responsible to to cross high street or you know i know that my son has said to me before when he was at the at the middle school i'm going to ride my bike there what from west medford that makes no sense to me it's too far you know what i mean it's too it's it's rush hour traffic there's so many you know obviously the bus to me would be the safest route for you to get your kid to school and <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8505.683s">There</a> is the convenience of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8506.783s">People</a> have to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8508.164s">This</a> is a district that the majority of parents are two working parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8513.365s">And,</a> you know, they have to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8517.026s">And</a> to think the kids are going to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8518.206s">I</a> mean, I know when I go for a walk, it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to walk a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8522.807s">So</a> what time are kids getting up? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8524.648s">What</a> time are we sending them out the door? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8525.948s">Is</a> it dark? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8527.368s">Because</a> I think this all has to factor into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8531.009s">And</a> I just think it's such a, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8535.439s">broad</a> aspect of saying like you know we're going to make sure the kids are safe but who's who's going to be the final say and what's safe for each individual kid so i just think that we just have to throw that out there and like i said i'd be more than happy to hop on board with any transportation meetings coming up so if you can let me know i'd be more than happy to do that so thank you thank you um<h2><a href="../2024-07-03_LWQCkV2s9zM/2024-07-03_LWQCkV2s9zM.html">7.03.2024 - MSC Special Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1721.42s">a</a> huge, a huge undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1724.381s">And</a> I think it's a huge, amazing, it's really amazing that this was happening in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1731.162s">I</a> love that Jonas said that this is making him be, you know, a better person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1734.743s">He's</a> not walking by something and what more do we want in our community than someone to say, hey, this needs to be fixed or this isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1742.925s">I</a> think that it's one of the most important things that you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1745.525s">It</a> is so hard to get up to that podium and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1749.486s">Jonah</a> you did it without any writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1752.708s">I</a> stood at that podium many times I couldn't do without writing something ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1756.551s">You're</a> very well spoken, I've watched you grow at the Brooks, and I'm so grateful that you're here so thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1762.234s">Savannah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1763.575s">I'm</a> a huge fan of your mama but you might have moved ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1768.058s">in</a> the McLaughlin chain for me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1770.159s">That</a> was awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1771.1s">You</a> and Adam are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1772.74s">I've</a> loved watching all these Brooks bees come up here, especially once a bee, always a bee, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1777.743s">So</a> my heart is always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1779.183s">So</a> thank you guys so much for making a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1781.444s">And</a> thanks for switching on the taser and the pepper spray. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1786.046s">Good</a> job.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4084.77s">I'll</a> second that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4104.158s">I</a> think I may be one of your biggest fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4106.801s">I've</a> said from day one that I thought you were unicorn, I was on the committee to hire you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4110.885s">Remember</a> Graham was there also there was there was maybe 10 to 15 of us that were in that room when you came into interview, and you walked out and there was this silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4122.216s">And</a> I remember just saying, if all of you don't wanna give her a hug right now, I'm moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4127.859s">And</a> luckily you are still the unicorn and I just can, I don't wanna become emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4132.601s">I</a> promise I would never cry here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4133.882s">And</a> every time, every week I say, I'm not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4137.744s">But</a> these are happy, happy, this makes me very, very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4141.066s">I</a> have really, really pushed for accountability in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4144.707s">I</a> have really begged for safety, accountability, yes, more than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4152.096s">I'm</a> proud of you, I thank you so much, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4154.778s">You</a> and Chad are rock stars in my book, so thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4158.4s">I'm</a> still not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4160.542s">But</a> I think that there's always still work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4165.004s">The</a> amount of emails that we get about day-to-day basis things that are happening in the building still concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4170.788s">I'm</a> not trying to be a Debbie Downer by any means because I am really Medford's cheerleader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4176.552s">But</a> I just wanna make sure that we don't lose sight of the day-to-day <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4181.215s">things</a> that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4183.556s">The</a> Welch page was not in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4187.098s">Can</a> we have a copy?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4194.282s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4195.423s">Awesome.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4196.643s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4197.364s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4198.584s">Keep</a> up the great work.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7100.26s">My</a> voice is so loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7102.662s">Can</a> we specify the elementary positions by building that are being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7107.868s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7193.362s">I</a> think seeing five at the Missittuck is devastating. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7198.323s">And</a> as someone who has worked at the Brooks, I know that the staff is short, but can I ask why there are no staff at the Brooks being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7206.246s">Not</a> that I want to see anybody cut, I'm just curious where the discrepancies are.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7249.409s">Other</a> question.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7254.212s">I</a> have it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7254.813s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7255.113s">I</a> just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7258.575s">With</a> the reduction of the administrative assistance, are we still suggesting six are being cut even though three are taking the early retirement?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7269.902s">So</a> there's only three?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7274.204s">So</a> only three administrative assistance will be cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7277.587s">Not</a> six?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7284.509s">I</a> don't like that word, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7285.75s">We</a> talked about that last week because three positions are three people at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7288.972s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7306.187s">So</a> is the elementary position at the McGlynn being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7311.07s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7315.493s">I</a> don't understand how a <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7318.237s">building</a> secretary is cut if she was six miles away, would she be cut, I don't, I don't understand how that is equivalent is an equivalent, I really, this one I cannot wrap my brain around. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7330.807s">I</a> really cannot wrap my brain around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7333.249s">How</a> can you go a whole school without the school secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7337.073s">I</a> don't understand how this is going to be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7340.675s">If,</a> if, if someone else is going to do her job so does that mean we're paying the other person double, where are we, where are we saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7348.066s">because</a> someone else is gonna have to do her whole job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7351.028s">It's</a> not, well, someone will pick up the slack. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7354.57s">This</a> is a whole position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7356.291s">Has</a> anybody shadowed a school secretary? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7360.414s">Superintendent,</a> have you shadowed a school secretary?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7365.897s">Yeah,</a> that would be great.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7384.888s">So</a> if she's there every day, how are we saving money? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7394.134s">Does</a> she get paid less? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7394.874s">Is</a> she not in the union? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7395.975s">What</a> happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7396.775s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7397.376s">I</a> really do not understand.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7402.185s">So</a> if we have a floater who needs to be in a building all the time... Yes, but they can have... Saving money.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7472.968s">Okay,</a> so if you need a floater when someone's absent for one day, why wouldn't we need the position filled for the 180 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7492.625s">I'm</a> sorry, it just that that just seems like such a disservice to the McGlynn elementary community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7497.391s">I</a> just, I think that we're really want to see our district thrive, and I feel like we survive every day because I know everybody here is working their butt off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7512.797s">And</a> I'm listening, you know, I watched a mom nurse her baby out here who's been at school all day, you know, and, and another one that has her toddler on the floor is the people who are doing other people's jobs all the time is when you work in a school you're pitching in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7526.629s">It's</a> not as easy just to close the door and walk away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7528.931s">It's</a> not how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7530.712s">When</a> you walk in that building you are 100 people to 100 different <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7535.598s">different</a> avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7536.819s">And</a> I really, I think that we're, we're, we're giving the McGlynn elementary, such a huge disservice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7542.722s">Great</a> we have a floater, but if Mrs. Hardy is absent at the Brooks and she's at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7547.421s">Then</a> now the McGlynn doesn't have a secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7550.184s">And</a> why is Mrs. Hardy's position, no offense, Mrs. Hardy, but why is her position for one day so important that she gets covered, but the 180 days of the McGlynn doesn't get covered?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7673.669s">Okay,</a> well I guess we remain to be seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7678.85s">Under</a> nursing, four nurses still being cut?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7686.189s">You</a> know, as a parent whose child needed emergency services at our school, this is such a disservice to every single child. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7693.794s">And</a> it's such a disservice to these nurses who are working overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7697.856s">Some</a> in my own family, you know, some from my own family, they helped save my daughter's life one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7704.74s">So</a> to think that we could go four less or we could go one less assistant, it's such a disservice to our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7712.825s">We</a> are barely surviving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7714.835s">And</a> this is really devastating, in my opinion, that this is going to happen, that we've got to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7724.761s">I'm</a> concerned about the Brooks, the staffing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7727.822s">You</a> said, you know, you're concerned about the Brooks with the health services.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7762.392s">So</a> we are going to be hiring an incoming director. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7765.074s">Someone's</a> going to take every Heinz place.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7767.696s">So</a> that position is going to be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7769.558s">That's</a> already been posted for how long now?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7853.371s">How</a> many are assigned to the high school now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7855.252s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7856.432s">So</a> that won't change? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7857.732s">That</a> will not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7858.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7860.373s">For</a> guidance, I believe last week we discussed, or two weeks ago, we discussed that they also teach a class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7868.036s">So</a> if we're cutting them by half, who's teaching the class?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7881.92s">Do</a> you want me to repeat that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7883.721s">So</a> the guidance Councilors at the middle school, I believe last week we talked about, or two weeks ago, I'm sorry, that we talked about that they also teach classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7893.144s">So</a> I'm curious, who's gonna teach those classes now that there's one less person? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7898.885s">How</a> are we managing them to teach the class plus service the students?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7915.685s">So</a> one Councilor, and how many students are at the middle schools?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7932.756s">they</a> are gonna service 440 students plus teach classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7938.339s">And</a> then at the Andrews, one person is gonna take care of 442 students plus teach classes to 442 students? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7949.966s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7950.907s">I'm</a> not too good at division in my head.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7958.892s">I'm</a> afraid it's not gonna happen, and this is what scares me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7961.593s">This</a> is what scares me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7963.354s">Superintendent.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8071.195s">Do</a> adjustment Councilors teach classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8075.076s">No,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8077.096s">Okay,</a> and then do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment Councilor?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8098.711s">What</a> about a school psychologist? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8102.214s">Okay,</a> I'm just asking.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8118.51s">For</a> staffing adjustment councils, you said it was reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8122.131s">That's</a> a scary word to me that we're just reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8129.852s">I</a> think that's it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8130.852s">Thank</a> you, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8131.452s">I</a> appreciate your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8132.773s">I</a> appreciate these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8134.193s">I</a> don't like them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8135.553s">I</a> can't help but be cranky about it because it's devastating. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8138.334s">Like</a> I said before, there's nothing more I want than to see us thrive, not to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8143.675s">My</a> children are in this district, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8148.002s">This</a> is our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8148.922s">To</a> me, this is what community is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8151.023s">We</a> need to fight for these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8152.884s">We</a> need to fight for these teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8153.924s">We</a> need to fight for these administrators that are in the building that are on the ground every single day, program directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8162.547s">I</a> mean, the whole marching band is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8164.787s">It's</a> not just cutting a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8166.368s">It's</a> cutting the heart of a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8169.009s">I</a> can't agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8170.909s">I</a> haven't slept in two weeks.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11336.4s">Member</a> Brandling, so just to follow up, Jerry, you had mentioned that when things are cut, we would then talk to the directors about how that would happen, but didn't we cut the directors? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11348.462s">It</a> says six, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11357.784s">Departments</a> affected, administrators, is that the same thing?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11372.967s">So</a> if the contract ends June 30th and we get the numbers on June 30th, and you mentioned that date, how do we ask somebody who's no longer in the position? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11380.949s">I</a> think the hope is that we would have those numbers long before June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11383.87s">Well,</a> I have a lot of hopes tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11386.63s">And</a> I'm not sure that they're all gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11388.071s">So</a> we can hope that that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11390.811s">But</a> is that really the reality if we've got those positions?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11404.855s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11406.075s">But</a> why would I want someone in a different department to answer the question about a different department? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11411.317s">Am</a> I missing something? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11417.439s">The</a> superintendent can answer if she'd like.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11434.123s">Yeah,</a> so I know that they've been informed in Jerry said that he doesn't have the final answers that he would consult with the directors and they would they would, you know, figure things out then but if we've cut the directors, how do we ask them.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11486.669s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11488.389s">On</a> the payroll positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11490.79s">It</a> says that there are times people are waiting weeks or months, and that it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11496.517s">that</a> we could if we could get some of these reports that we've been asking for that some some of the things we asked for is a system issue, but some is a person issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11504.643s">So</a> if it's a system issue, and we hire two people, we still have the system that we have to deal with that we're not getting a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11514.331s">So</a> if we have two people that still can't get those numbers out of the system, is it really worth hiring the two people?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11526.538s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11529.04s">And</a> then for the retirement, does retirement not go through City Hall?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11557.263s">So</a> do we know if the if the hold up is city side or school side.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11598.735s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11599.916s">And</a> then just in the sake of education, I just want to get the definition of grandstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11610.447s">It's</a> a noun and it's derogatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11613.209s">And</a> it says, it's the action of behaving in a showy manner in an attempt to attract favorable attention from spectators or the media. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11619.874s">So</a> I in no way ever want to be grandstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11623.577s">If</a> I seem grandstanding to you, this is just who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11627.68s">And</a> I show my heart on my sleeve and I have passion for things that I care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11632.364s">And</a> this is what I care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11634.145s">This</a> is why I'm in this seat.<h2><a href="../2024-05-07_S39QSClb618/2024-05-07_S39QSClb618.html">Public Budget Hearing</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4080.625s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4086.246s">Well,</a> I'd ask if I'm making faces, but I already know I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4088.867s">So</a> I'm trying to, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4092.239s">center</a> myself because this is obviously horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4096.081s">And</a> as somebody who has worked in an elementary school in this district, I don't see how any of this could even be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4107.787s">I'm</a> not gonna take it out on you, Jerry, because I know you're doing a job and I thank you for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4111.109s">So</a> it's not personal, of course, but I have- I don't take it personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4114.37s">A</a> lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4115.611s">So</a> you keep saying we. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4119.353s">We</a> came to this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4121.234s">Who's</a> the we?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4165.1s">We,</a> okay, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4167.88s">Let's</a> see, I'm just gonna go page by page. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4176.102s">The</a> ESSER funding, those positions on this page here, Brooke, let's see, I'm on 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4184.303s">Are</a> any of those gonna be added to the general fund?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4188.564s">They're</a> all added, okay, I just wanna make sure before I go kooky.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4199.446s">And</a> I have to agree with our student rep here, the two full-time employees with payroll and HR that are being suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4210.015s">You</a> said the words, it's hard for them to keep up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4215.599s">So</a> I think it's gonna be hard for teachers to keep up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4220.783s">I</a> think it's gonna be hard for nurses to keep up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4223.106s">I</a> think it's going to be hard for secretaries to keep up at this rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4228.509s">We're</a> burning people out as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4231.211s">And</a> this is going to just increase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4240.538s">Yes,</a> it would be hard to work without two more full-time people, but it'll also be hard to work with only one nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4246.262s">It</a> will also be hard to work with only one administrative assistant at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4250.325s">It</a> is two separate schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4252.907s">It</a> is two separate schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4259.071s">I</a> know they're housed in that same office, but that doesn't make any one more valuable or less valuable than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4265.816s">They're</a> two separate schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4269.028s">It</a> doesn't mean that one can absorb the work of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4272.53s">And</a> as an administrative assistant myself, I don't see the people that are above me that I'm an administrative assistant to do more work on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4287.995s">I</a> see that we're leaned upon more and more every day from something as simple as the coffee machine being jammed. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4296.158s">Sometimes</a> I pretend I don't hear them saying to me, Nicole, Nicole, I need your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4299.319s">I'm</a> like, it's a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4301.279s">You</a> can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4302.38s">Let</a> me show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4305.161s">I</a> think it's almost offensive to think that <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4309.588s">you</a> know, their need is less because it truly is more. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4313.812s">And</a> especially at an elementary school level where children are coming into you, parents are coming into you, the phone never stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4323.78s">That</a> alone, I don't know how one administrative assistant is gonna just handle the phone alone, let alone all the chaos around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4333.749s">So</a> how do you choose <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4337.705s">that</a> elementary school over a different elementary school, because there's not anybody else there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4341.347s">But</a> that doesn't mean that the administrative assistant for the middle school can handle what is going to be put on her from the elementary side. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4349.953s">It's</a> almost unfathomable to me to think that that is a position that could at all be cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4356.297s">So</a> that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4360.465s">Okay,</a> kindergarten teachers added in FY 24 will not be continued in FY 25, but did we not see that the enrollment is increasing in lower grades?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4398.011s">None</a> will be saved, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4428.646s">Has</a> anybody shadowed anybody in the kindergarten? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4434.649s">Just</a> curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4435.25s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4435.67s">Anybody</a> shadowed the nurses? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4437.947s">Has</a> anybody shadowed any of these directors that are being cut to see what's actually happening on a day-to-day basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4443.429s">Because</a> I can tell you... We have been doing a really good job, I think, trying to get job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4455.493s">But</a> what's written on a piece of paper, what your job is, when you walk into that building, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4460.563s">you</a> are a hundred things to hundreds of little humans that can't wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4469.033s">They</a> can't wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4469.554s">They're</a> throwing up, they're pooping, they're doing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4471.736s">And</a> I don't care what grade they're in, they're all doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4474.8s">So</a> I think to, you know, cut jobs without literally <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4481.372s">knowing</a> hands-on, on the ground, what exactly is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4485.276s">I</a> don't know how much more existing staff, if these are all cut, can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4490.681s">How</a> can you handle it? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4491.502s">How</a> can you be there from eight to three, which I know is not what a teacher's job is not eight to three, believe me, I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4497.947s">So</a> it's 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4500.91s">But</a> how do you... <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4503.052s">How</a> does anybody absorb even more? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4506.555s">What</a> is the toll we're going to take on everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4508.837s">And</a> if we take the toll on our teachers, guess who it's falling down onto? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4514.002s">The</a> kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4515.383s">These</a> are our babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4516.684s">We</a> want enrollment to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4517.825s">It's</a> never going to go up like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4519.306s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4520.187s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4521.788s">People</a> are going to run away. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4524.671s">OK,</a> I'll keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4529.284s">strain</a> on staff, yes, clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4531.546s">I</a> can't imagine being in any class with 22 kindergarten children or 22.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4538.351s">I</a> don't know where the .2 comes from because guidance Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4544.956s">I</a> know, I hate averages. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4548.218s">So</a> proposed saving initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4551.601s">Do</a> guidance Councilors teach guidance classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4553.542s">Yes,</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4557.361s">Okay,</a> so if we cut them, who's doing that and still guiding?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4576.108s">The</a> principals?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4580.07s">So</a> maybe they rely on the administrative assistants a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4587.024s">And</a> I know these are the numbers, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4590.147s">I</a> get that this is real dollars and there's $5 million or $7 million, the number just seems to keep adding up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4597.132s">So</a> I'm also curious, if we eliminate directors, do directors walk out the door or do they then absorb a teaching job? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4608.522s">How</a> does that work?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4681.997s">Yeah,</a> so I know you said it's a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4685.532s">Not</a> a person, but at the end of the day, it is a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4687.893s">It</a> is at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4688.773s">It</a> is at the end of the day, because if you're bumping someone, someone else is out.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4692.854s">And</a> that's less, and I know you realize that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4697.516s">And</a> I can't imagine any of these schools working with one body less at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4704.158s">I</a> really, it's gonna be detrimental, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4709.679s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4711.32s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4713.939s">Yeah,</a> McGlynn principal office consolidated from two to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4716.28s">That's</a> outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4719.22s">Reduce</a> nursing staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4721.101s">And</a> I'm sure the nurses that are here can help us understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4724.522s">Can</a> someone tell me how many students are at each elementary school just to start there?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4739.405s">So</a> maybe the nurses can answer my question a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4744.218s">working</a> at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4749.283s">I</a> used to say to Nurse Allison all the time, I feel like we should have one of those little deli ticket things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4757.49s">Because</a> not only are there emergencies all day, I mean, I can tell you what happens in the kindergarten playground pretty clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4768.376s">What</a> happens if that nurse needs to, they leave the room, now the nurse's office is closed, and there's another emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4776.482s">Field</a> trips, how do we manage field trips with less nurses? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4781.766s">Things</a> like this that keep popping into my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4784.128s">I</a> don't know how these things are gonna get done with less bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4789.913s">It's</a> not gonna get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4793.295s">Let's...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4795.319s">That's</a> really sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4796.559s">It's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4799.8s">And</a> then if a nurse is absent, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4802.441s">Everybody</a> hold on.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4819.627s">So</a> we'll have a director for the nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4822.788s">Yes?</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4832.745s">So</a> the director for the nurses will figure that out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4837.366s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4840.827s">Let's</a> see, what else?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4850.23s">There's</a> a lot of jobs posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4854.277s">a</a> lot not filled, and that's what scares me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4857.26s">Because</a> if it's not filled, then what? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4860.223s">We</a> need to know the then what's here when we do something like this, because this is real day-to-day challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4867.15s">And</a> I know, even for myself, I've needed the school nurse at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4872.476s">I</a> got COVID when I worked at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4875.402s">How</a> many times I was checked for lice? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4876.864s">Luckily,</a> never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4877.805s">I</a> don't know how. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4878.185s">But</a> do you know how many times my head was checked for lice? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4880.909s">Do</a> you know how many times I had to go to the nurse's office for something? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4883.572s">A</a> student injured me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4885.854s">That</a> happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4886.956s">This</a> is real, live stuff that's happening every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4891.061s">And</a> we're, I don't want to use the word failing, but I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4896.654s">failing,</a> happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4899.116s">Identifying</a> other resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4901.157s">You</a> said we'll need to revisit this in 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4903.038s">Will</a> there be funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4905.58s">So</a> we're cutting, but then we're gonna have to revisit again for even more cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4909.742s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4911.103s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4914.945s">All</a> right, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4916.166s">This</a> page. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4920.289s">You</a> said we haven't looked at paras, custodians, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4926.616s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4929.26s">Let's</a> see, my next page. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4931.923s">So</a> I talked about foreshadowing the people whose jobs were cutting.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4969.861s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4973.302s">Individuals</a> that are being cut as in directors, how do we know if they're cut, someone's not necessarily replacing them, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4983.284s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4984.144s">So</a> how do we know that the people are gonna step in and do their job are qualified to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4988.564s">because</a> it's gonna be someone under where the director was originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4992.826s">So</a> how do we know that they're qualified to make the decisions?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5066.173s">So</a> basically, if you're the senior in that group, you're most likely going to absorb some of the work.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5077.281s">Well,</a> that stinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5079.342s">Let's</a> see, what else?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5081.663s">It</a> really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5082.964s">Yes,</a> I can totally agree with you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5087.661s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5088.962s">The</a> director, we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5091.863s">We</a> talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5094.464s">Consultants,</a> how many consultants do we have working for us?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5104.388s">Or</a> anybody else?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5139.209s">Get</a> a list, if we can have a list of who is a consultant.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5145.833s">Are</a> there any cuts in assistant principals?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5150.056s">So</a> no assistant principals will be cut?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5152.898s">Across</a> the board?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5160.103s">Jerry.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5162.524s">You're</a> messing with me now, come on.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5189.46s">I</a> mean, I can't, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5192.418s">I</a> mean, I'll just use Mr. Tucci as an example, because I always say I've been Tucci-fied, because I'm at my sixth year at the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5199.884s">I'm</a> gonna miss it terribly next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5202.186s">I</a> don't think the man takes a day off. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5205.549s">I</a> think he's- Yeah, he's very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5207.07s">He's</a> exemplary, as are all of our principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5212.795s">But</a> I can't imagine not having an assistant principal.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5217.298s">And</a> especially at the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5221.305s">Have</a> we decided on any cuts in the central administration office?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5226.786s">None?</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5228.067s">Not</a> one.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5240.971s">I'm</a> sorry?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5245.533s">I</a> think all our staffing is lean.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5250.746s">Okay,</a> I'm gonna stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5253.526s">So</a> I just have one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5255.047s">The</a> raise that we received as school committee members, where did that, what was that funding from again?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5262.409s">Our</a> raise?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5264.289s">Yeah,</a> there's no more money in there?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5266.57s">Is</a> there no more money in there that we could use any of that for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5269.831s">Because</a> it seemed really easy for us to get our raises.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5335.185s">Lucky</a> for you, I'm all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5337.247s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5341.932s">And</a> I'm not trying to be cranky, but obviously this hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5350.661s">My</a> children are in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5352.843s">My</a> family's in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5354.98s">This,</a> this is our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5356.481s">Yeah,</a> this is our community these the people that go home into our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5360.102s">These</a> are the kids that stand in front of my house and for the best every single morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5363.003s">These</a> are the people that pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5364.864s">And</a> so it's, it's just so frustrating to me because I think when you work in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5371.266s">you</a> have such a different perspective of what's happening day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5374.569s">And</a> I'm no expert, I'm no expert at all, but I think it definitely gives you a bird's eye view of really what is happening on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5384.857s">And</a> I think, you know, I'm sure we have plenty of people here that would like to speak and I really encourage everybody to speak and to write emails and to send letters because this is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5397.327s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9599.689s">Nurse</a> Jen, can I just ask you a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9602.211s">How</a> many nurses do we have in the district right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9603.852s">I</a> might have that number here, but the numbers are- That's okay.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9614.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9615.822s">And</a> what number day are we on in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9617.364s">I</a> know, I know everybody here definitely knows that 29 days left. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9622.769s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9623.049s">Nobody's</a> counting. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9624.57s">I</a> get it.<h2><a href="../2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc/2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc.html">4.29.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3532.701s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4425.496s">So</a> can I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4429.279s">Do</a> I need to abstain because my daughter's in culinary or can I say yes?

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5498.493s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5498.933s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5499.414s">If</a> you could share that with us, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5502.276s">And</a> then my question, what is the difference between a teacher coverage and a loss of prep? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5507.68s">I</a> know when I was at the Brooks, a loss of prep was, okay, you know, Mr. Sacco's absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5513.385s">There's</a> no one to cover loss of prep.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5521.032s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5551.67s">Okay,</a> and then loss of prep and teacher coverage paid at different rates.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5581.919s">Okay,</a> so teacher coverage and loss of prep is both $40 an hour now.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5590.341s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8795.309s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8797.593s">And</a> you said reimbursement would be 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8799.414s">That's</a> if we get- Reimbursement will definitely not be 100%.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8841.918s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8842.178s">So</a> we are going to be asking the city council for this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8844.72s">Where</a> does that money come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8845.64s">Um,</a> that is all work for the mayor and the council to do and good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8851.123s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8852.81s">Okay,</a> and then just one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8855.271s">Non-voting</a> member addition is member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8859.313s">Why</a> was that decided?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9489.598s">I'd</a> be more than happy to offer anything that anybody needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9493.099s">If</a> I needed to be another non-voting member, I'd be more than happy to volunteer for that, just to throw that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9498.52s">If</a> we wanna take the non-voting member addition off altogether, I'm comfortable with that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9505.462s">But</a> just to offer that I'd be more than happy to do that also.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9540.863s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9543.815s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9916.286s">So</a> can we just be clear that we're adding the two additional members, correct, from the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9920.169s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9925.932s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9926.333s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10049.616s">Member</a> Friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10053.199s">I</a> just have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10054.56s">Why</a> do we have a different handbook for every school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10058.163s">Why</a> do we not have a handbook for elementary one for middle and one for high school?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10111.192s">Like,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10112.592s">I</a> figured that that was a case that we all needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10114.973s">They</a> all needed to have their own handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10116.393s">I</a> just figured one could say the Brooks with the principals and, you know, whatever staff that needs to be on there, but all the meat is the same because to me, if I'm a student at the Brooks and I go over to the McGlynn, the rule should be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10128.875s">If</a> I'm at the high school and I walk over to the Volk or I'm at the, at the Curtis, those rules should be the same, same at the McGlynn and the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10137.967s">So</a> I'm just, I just want to make sure that, like you said, 90 something percent or whatever, it is the same.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10187.484s">Okay,</a> I just, when I got the binder, I'm like, I can't go for four elementary schools and see if page one was the same as page one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10196.616s">the</a> way wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10197.056s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure that was clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10198.458s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10199.459s">Welcome.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10479.653s">Good</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10481.334s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3343.035s">Hello,</a> Nicole Branley, 54 Norwich Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3346.117s">I</a> was just wondering if I could request that the school committee be invited on that tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3349.639s">I</a> think for 14 elected officials in this city that we can all work together to support our first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3355.342s">That's</a> possible.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3365.321s">I</a> mean, they don't have to come, but if they could be invited, we could be invited, that would be great.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3374.788s">Good.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-03-19_a6yjvy9bets/2024-03-19_a6yjvy9bets.html">3.18.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4011.36s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4015.382s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5185.068s">So,</a> yes, a lot of thanks to Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5189.47s">Obviously,</a> I was thrilled to hear that there was, you know, less of a deficit here than what we're looking at the day before, or the week before, the meeting before. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5198.654s">So</a> I just have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5200.455s">The</a> error that occurred, the error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5206.718s">Are</a> we sure that that's correct, Val?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5231.574s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5231.874s">So</a> will we get an update if anything changed?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5252.626s">And</a> then just one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5253.426s">It</a> says, we identified spending that could be postponed to FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5258.749s">Does</a> that make things look worse for us, for FY25? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5261.67s">I</a> mean, we can push them off now and balance, but now, does that mean in FY25 we're causing a bigger problem?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5288.837s">Yeah,</a> so could we get a dollar amount on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5290.578s">Can</a> we request that?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5338.246s">Even</a> though it says spending.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5340.587s">It</a> says we identified spending that could be postponed.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7096.498s">Thank</a> you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7098.279s">So</a> I just wanted to compliment the STEPS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7100.78s">My</a> family has benefited from that and it was a huge <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7106.348s">plus</a> trying to get back to school, you know, when obviously you're going through something to make sure that that gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7112.509s">And</a> the rotation is awesome with academics because the teachers are coming in there, they're helping when need be, and it's really a safe space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7120.41s">Does</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7120.71s">Cunningham</a> still?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7122.791s">She's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7123.571s">So</a> I just want to give her a shout out for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7125.711s">I'm</a> very grateful to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7127.632s">And</a> then just one other question, the high school counseling, so that's nexus for high school, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7133.413s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7133.893s">And</a> that's done by the Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7135.723s">No,</a> it's academic teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7137.563s">Academic</a> teachers, so like health teachers?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7145.945s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7146.485s">So</a> it's a co-taught classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7148.086s">Co-taught</a> classroom, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7149.766s">How</a> does it not fall under health? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7151.326s">Like</a> under health, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7155.948s">How</a> does English and science <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7159.076s">teach</a> the nexus portion of that?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8924.251s">Member</a> Burnley? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8925.752s">I'm</a> up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8926.212s">Well,</a> thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8927.013s">This</a> is very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8930.555s">One</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8931.816s">I'm</a> looking at the numbers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8933.538s">It</a> looks like my glasses broke as I walked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8935.979s">So</a> forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8937.833s">But</a> it looks like our numbers have doubled from our 350 back in 2015 and 16 to 631 as of March 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8942.699s">So</a> I'm curious how our staff has risen with that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8985.365s">And</a> I've been in some of those classrooms at the Brooks, and it is amazing to me, the teachers that teach these classes, not that they're not using their words, but it is such a diverse group. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9000.171s">I</a> think I remember Allie, and I can't even think of her last name right now, but her saying to me that, you know, 10 languages in her class, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9010.305s">I</a> remember saying, how do you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9012.026s">I</a> mean, we're speaking English in the kindergarten downstairs and I feel like half the kids aren't listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9017.911s">I</a> feel like they're not hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9019.352s">So</a> how are you doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9020.312s">And</a> it just amazed me how creative they are so that everybody is getting the same curriculum at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9028.218s">It</a> really is astounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9029.139s">So</a> huge shout out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9031.161s">And</a> then my other question, I want to thank Mr. Fallon for buying 15 of these little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9038.547s">He's</a> a rock star too. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9040.509s">And</a> then on one of these pages here, you have the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9049.837s">I</a> don't see the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9051.358s">So</a> I'm just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9054.563s">I</a> know the programs are housed at the McGlynn Middle School, but how does that change their enrollment all year long? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9063.376s">I</a> mean, it must be constantly changing.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.953s">That</a> was just my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9084.913s">Cause</a> I'm figuring if all of these kids are influxing to just the McGlynn, how are we balancing that off? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9090.156s">Cause</a> it seems. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9091.872s">like</a> that would happen a lot more than someone that would move in still, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9095.694s">So</a> if we could just get those numbers, I would love to see that if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9100.597s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9102.478s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9103.527s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Secretary.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10862.338s">I</a> can second.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11237.361s">Remember</a> finally. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11239.981s">Sorry</a> So I was also in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11242.902s">I</a> was here actually during all of this the other night at the City Council, and it didn't seem like the voters were very happy about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11250.223s">It</a> seemed like there was a lot of uproar <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11258.547s">How</a> are we going to manage this, this fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11261.85s">I</a> mean, I know it says here emergencies, but then we also said the stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11265.752s">So</a> can we use that for anything?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12011.761s">So,</a> this obviously hits very close to home for me I know that we spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12017.537s">privately</a> over email, but I just want to thank you for being brave enough to come up here, because I know personally how hard that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12025.061s">I</a> promised myself that I would never cry at a school community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12027.043s">I'm</a> not going to start now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12028.523s">It's</a> still too early in my term, but there's still time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12032.126s">But</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12033.186s">Thank</a> you very much for sharing your story with us, because I know what that feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12037.028s">I</a> know how all of this feels. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12038.569s">And</a> I know that when I did return my email to you, that I said it actually took me courage to even respond to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12047.034s">So</a> thank you for standing there and know that this could be the result of you standing there one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12053.655s">You</a> just never know where the road is going to lead you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12055.936s">So</a> always speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12057.116s">And</a> I say that to anybody that's out there in the public, like you never know where the road will lead you or sometimes, you know, what you think or what is your some of your darkest days turns into something completely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12068.178s">So</a> thank you for being brave enough to come here and tell your story.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_XMyVKWwRIL8/2024-06-01_XMyVKWwRIL8.html">City Council 03-12-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2432.595s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2433.715s">So</a> I just wanted to confirm that in the Medford school committee meeting, I don't think it was this one or maybe the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2439.576s">Gerry</a> McCue did come to the podium and did discuss that we did have a 2.5 million deficit that is not a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2446.297s">He</a> stood here, I actually confirm that because I thought maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2450.956s">I</a> was incorrect but I was correct he did stand here he did discuss the 2.5 million deficit in the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2457.758s">We</a> did pass a motion and I'd like to thank Mrs. O'Leary for bringing up the fact that we did pass a motion that we will not run out of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2466.54s">So</a> this is what we've come to in this city that we're passing motions that we don't run out of paper in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2473.082s">That</a> breaks my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2476.252s">We</a> do have a budget freeze. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2479.593s">And</a> of course, if I'm incorrect in any of this, someone can correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2482.994s">But</a> we have stopped purchasing water for our teachers, just simple bubbler water for our teachers in their in their lunchroom, which I know they have a faucet, I know that they can bring their Stanley cup also. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2499.178s">But</a> I think that we've really <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2503.396s">gone</a> over the line here of what of what's happening so I know people are very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2509.064s">I</a> just want to encourage people to always come to meetings, where we're here I'm here just like you guys at a meeting regularly so I know you're upset now but there's stuff that happens in this chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2521.019s">multiple</a> times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2523.061s">So</a> be present, you know, know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2525.523s">So</a> yes, that's happening in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2528.645s">And</a> I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and all of you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2532.648s">But</a> know that that is a true number. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2534.91s">We</a> are $2.5 million in the whole for the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2537.833s">And</a> that is devastating as someone who's worked in the Medford public school system and who has children in the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2545.599s">And</a> as a school committee member, here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2551.016s">So</a> I think we really need to hold ourselves accountable because this is this is who voted us in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2557.186s">This</a> is who voted us in and we need to listen to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2559.21s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-03-05_wn9Gi3fuhEM/2024-03-05_wn9Gi3fuhEM.html">3.4.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5878.195s">It</a> says new registration April 1st remains open until April 13th, but just curious about their re-registration.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=5914.082s">Okay,</a> and then does that stay open, like if they, do they have a deadline that they have to meet that by if they're re-registering?

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4511.86s">So</a> thank you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4513.581s">I</a> just have a question on, you said there are eight referrals from the high school that we placed in the spring or next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4519.844s">So</a> that means eight more students coming in addition to your 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4523.265s">Am</a> I right when I hear that?

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=4575.702s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8034.449s">So</a> I think mine pretty much piggybacks off of what Member Graham had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8040.97s">On</a> the first page, I'm just curious, these $102,005 <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8044.172s">This</a> is outside, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8045.994s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8046.796s">So</a> my concern with that being our level spot there, are we checking what's inside? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8055.587s">Because</a> I'm guessing the temperature inside is going to be much hotter. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8058.84s">temperature</a> outside.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8072.831s">Yes,</a> because that makes me nervous, especially up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8075.212s">And</a> then is there a way to link that MIA heat protocol with our protocol when the time comes so that somebody can just click on it and then we're there? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8087.313s">And</a> then Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8090.715s">And</a> then, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8091.696s">So</a> my most questions were on the equipment needs, like when, how we paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8099.54s">Rentals</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8100.921s">Is</a> it going to be across the district if we have a rental for a misting who's who's walking through the Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8106.687s">Is</a> it like a vegetable mister? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8108.028s">Like</a> this is what I kept picturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8109.089s">I'm</a> like, are we just gonna walk through with our clothes on? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8110.95s">Like,</a> what is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8111.991s">Is</a> it outside?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8128.322s">I</a> see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8128.882s">I</a> get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8129.402s">I'm</a> with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8130.403s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8137.048s">And</a> then at the high school, obviously, I'm guessing one of the larger concerns overall for all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8143.853s">I</a> don't know exactly how many schools have air conditioning and who doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8147.596s">I</a> don't know, are we supposed to talk about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8149.337s">I</a> mean, I'm assuming that that can be public knowledge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8155.041s">I</a> mean, I'm assuming they all have it, but is it all functioning?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8163.458s">Okay,</a> right because I feel like that's, that's a good question.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4709.342s">Okay,</a> our start our current stipend is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4711.924s">And</a> although not equivalent to you on the city council, I'm not sure it really should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4715.986s">I</a> don't think anyone would begrudge the school committee a fair living wage increase like other unions in the city have agreed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4724.152s">But</a> this proposed increase is exorbitant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4726.113s">It's</a> not in line with the increases anybody else has gotten in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4729.736s">And</a> I have sat right here in this room listening to the budget hearings and never once have I heard that we have any extra money, especially in our school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4738.221s">I</a> also think this proposal itself causes even more animosity between elected officials, like all of us, and the same people that voted us in to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4749.348s">So</a> let's do the right thing.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_sVx7vl5ZjhU/2024-10-05_sVx7vl5ZjhU.html">City Council 03-21-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4353.905s">I</a> go on School Brains pretty regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4356.266s">I</a> actually have a reminder on my phone to check it pretty regularly just to see missing assignments, anything that maybe I didn't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4364.049s">And</a> I did not notice the referral. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4366.37s">So</a> I only look on my phone, but I just noticed it's way at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4371.452s">So</a> I don't know if it's something that.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4377.316s">So,</a> Miss Bowen just showed me that on the laptop but on the phone it looks completely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4382.94s">So</a> I don't, I just saying that when I look on my phone which is the only place I access school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4388.104s">It's</a> done at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4390.091s">I've</a> probably looked at school brains three times this week, just knowing report cards were coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4394.054s">And</a> I didn't even know that that was there or notice it in my scrolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4399.098s">So</a> just to make a point of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4401.399s">And</a> then I think when it comes down to really the bottom line, and I think Jenny or Melanie might've said it, it's really just the communication at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4411.007s">So</a> the incident report that we got was great if we were told about it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4417.856s">So</a> we had had some incidents that happened that we were just not even told about at the end of the day, that even had our child's signature on them, which I found very concerning that no email or phone call had happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4430.881s">So</a> I think you can have a new form, an old form, but at the end of the day, if no one reaches out to you, even though our child made us aware of it, she didn't come home with the form either. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4445.171s">So</a> I just think at the end of the day, however we're communicating, as long as the communication is a real time, I think that that probably helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4454.014s">I</a> think someone mentioned the word trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4456.895s">And</a> I think that that would have been helpful even in some of the situations that I've heard of, that it does make you feel very insecure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4466.019s">So</a> I just wanted to throw that out there.<h2><a href="../2023-01-09_h2JMIPnvYME/2023-01-09_h2JMIPnvYME.html">1.9.2023 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8945.015s">Hello,</a> Nicole Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8949.718s">So</a> I just have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8952.841s">I</a> did reach out to the committee, thanking them for putting this all together because I do think pointing out the positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8961.536s">is</a> as important as pointing out things that would need to be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8964.138s">So</a> I do appreciate all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8967.481s">Assigning</a> the school resource officer in the mayor's communication on December 23rd, you had mentioned that there would be two officers, a female officer and an officer of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8979.19s">So</a> I'm just curious if there's gonna be a third officer or what happened with that?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9018.531s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9019.972s">And</a> then for the implementing clear consistent protocols for student identification, check in and hallway presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9029.164s">What</a> happens when they don't? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9031.487s">Like,</a> what are some of the consequences?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9038.807s">So</a> if they don't have their identification, once identifications are passed out, what if they don't have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9043.21s">Is</a> there a consequence to that?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9046.952s">I</a> mean, it's gonna be.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9100.864s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9102.885s">And</a> then you had touched upon just the cutting of the classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9106.686s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9107.799s">teachers</a> are going to be using the talking point app if a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9111.344s">What</a> was the procedure before.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9165.506s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9180.951s">For</a> a period.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9184.214s">And</a> then so what is the follow up to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9186.376s">Is</a> it still four offenses? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9188.878s">That</a> it's followed up by the AP?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9264.883s">So</a> is the talking point just going to the parent, right?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9272.311s">I</a> have it, yep, yep, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9273.531s">And</a> then, so is that also going to the AP too? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9278.395s">Is</a> it happening simultaneously? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9281.217s">No,</a> the talking points message to my knowledge- What I'm saying is the AP being told that today, when you said Johnny, so Johnny didn't show up, his mom was notified, but was the assistant principal notified so that those four are still being counted towards the discipline
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9315.575s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9315.895s">The</a> answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9316.877s">Okay,</a> mom, you know this now.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9324.626s">Okay,</a> just want to make sure that so the teacher is responsible to make sure both parties know now.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9439.735s">And</a> I think that maybe parents feeling even a little disconnected from that, because I know that when my child goes to school and I'm sure many parents feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9450.163s">Well,</a> I'm expecting them to be in English right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9452.731s">You</a> know, and then, you know, obviously when an emergency is happening at the school and you know that emergency response teams are there, you're thinking, okay, my child must be in math right now, not in a bathroom hanging out or in a hallway that no one's, you know, might be looking at regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9467.7s">So</a> I think that it's important that parents know where your child is during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9473.383s">And</a> I've said this, I think I've reached out to many of you saying that, you know, if there was just even a natural disaster, if you don't know where these students are, if they're supposed to be 30, you know, 30 kids in a class, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9483.146s">and</a> eight have walking around, three didn't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9486.489s">That's</a> a lot of responsibility for the teacher to say, I don't know where 11 kids are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9492.194s">So</a> I think that that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9494.816s">So</a> I just have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9496.838s">And</a> I think it was from member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9498.92s">I'm</a> curious when you did this new walkthrough, did you see a difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=9502.282s">Have</a> you walked through prior?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12893.055s">Okay,</a> so just in our situation alone, I just wanted to- I'm just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12897.838s">I'm</a> just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12898.458s">No,</a> I said you cut the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12899.679s">Oh,</a> that I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12902.481s">I</a> think I created the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12903.522s">No,</a> I'm just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12905.123s">So</a> just FYI for a member who's still at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12909.926s">So</a> our daughter had filled out what is called Medford High School, Medford Vocation Technical High School Incident Report Forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12917.671s">So</a> in her situation, a threat, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12922.554s">you</a> know, whatever was going on at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12925.155s">Went</a> to her as a principal, an incident report was written with the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12928.756s">It</a> is called the Method High Incident Report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12931.077s">There</a> is some for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12934.978s">There</a> are some for faculty and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12937.96s">There's</a> an incident report form for administrative response. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12940.781s">And</a> obviously, if there's anything that you think is different, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12944.382s">Like,</a> tell me if you think that there's something different that I'm not saying, to correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12949.524s">You</a> know what, that's all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12950.936s">just</a> to correct me, so there is incident report form, the administrative response, there's the incident report form for faculty and staff statements, there is the incident report for students, and also Joanne might also know the stat on this, and I believe if I'm correct that if there are three incident reports, then you can file a police report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12974.455s">That's</a> a no harassment order, three incidents of harassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12978.417s">Right,</a> but then you can also file a police report too. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12981.458s">So</a> there's different reports at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12984.46s">One,</a> Officer Conway takes care of, which would be the police report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12989.322s">And</a> then there's also reports that the high school fills out when your child comes to the school with a complaint or worry or a threat or whatever else is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=12999.347s">But</a> there are some that students fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13002.248s">There's</a> some for the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13004.642s">And</a> then there's some that I have here that say administrative response, but they are also redacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13010.724s">So</a> if you request them, they, they are redacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13012.904s">Cause</a> obviously if a student is talking about another student, they're going to say, you know, me and Melanie or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13017.386s">Um,</a> so they do need to be redacted before they're getting to anybody else.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13074.322s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13085.605s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13086.145s">And</a> we've noticed that too, not always notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13090.686s">So</a> I think that that definitely has to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13093.652s">And</a> I think to a student signing something with their signature, definitely is important that a parent gets told about that right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13104.736s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13105.196s">So</a> that was not always, at least in a situation that I'm very familiar with, that did not happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13111.918s">So</a> just FYI. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13113.679s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=13114.539s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_fxQMdebqk-Y/2024-11-19_fxQMdebqk-Y.html">City Council 12-20-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10480.365s">And</a> that bullying plan that I sat on a subcommittee meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10485.397s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10485.797s">Subcommittee</a> meeting, school committee meeting on December 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10489.858s">And</a> I said, I've never gotten these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10492.618s">I</a> don't, I asked if the bullying plan that we were going over was actually something currently that we were using because it was foreign to me in the sense that none of it was executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10506.981s">So</a> what we have in place needs to be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10510.581s">We</a> have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10512.402s">Don't</a> get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10513.282s">We</a> have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10515.403s">We</a> really need to step it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10517.904s">But</a> what we have in place could work if we followed it also. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10521.884s">That</a> has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10523.545s">So</a> I know Councilor Knight, you said maybe cancel school for the rest of the week because no learning will be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10532.746s">But</a> maybe something just as valuable as learning can be done because I noticed today that for our daughter, it was a bit therapeutic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10545.883s">to</a> be with her friends, to be with other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10550.144s">I</a> understand why parents or guardians felt that they didn't feel comfortable sending their kids or that kids didn't feel comfortable being at school today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10557.147s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10558.387s">But</a> today was probably the safest day to be at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10563.729s">It</a> certainly wasn't yesterday.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10569.271s">I</a> can vouch for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10571.532s">So</a> we have all these good faith discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10573.732s">I</a> heard the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10576.396s">mentioned</a> sustainable solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10581.138s">We</a> need to put our politics aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10583.479s">We</a> really need to put our politics aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10585.48s">We</a> need to all stop arguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10587.02s">I</a> know that I was very emotional last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10590.442s">This</a> whole situation is making me lose my voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10595.424s">But</a> the division is what our kids are seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10601.966s">That's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10603.287s">It's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10604.267s">They</a> need to see us all united. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10606.059s">And</a> I think that I've been very vocal to everybody that I am willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10612.162s">I</a> have an army of people behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10614.583s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10615.183s">It</a> is amazing to me, the outpouring of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10617.924s">And</a> I thank every single last one of them because it has helped give me the strength and helped give my daughter the strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10625.048s">Our</a> family, my husband and my son give us the strength to keep moving forward because there's no doubt if I went away, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10633.981s">If</a> I went away October 17th, if I pulled her from Mefford High, we'd be here right now, but it wouldn't be about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10644.623s">It</a> would just be another situation and maybe the urgency wouldn't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10648.804s">I</a> don't know why this has all happened to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10652.405s">I</a> really don't, but we can't stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10656.686s">And</a> I just, I beg every single parent to come to every single school committee meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10662.452s">to</a> join me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10663.472s">I've</a> sat here the first night, an abundance of people, but I've sat here every single meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10669.855s">You</a> all have seen me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10671.036s">I've</a> spoken at your meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10672.056s">I</a> think this is number three here at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10676.398s">We</a> need to hear your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10678.599s">We</a> need to hear voices, parents, because I've heard you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10681.681s">I'm</a> relaying the messages, but I'm just one woman repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10685.503s">We</a> need all of your voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10688.044s">So</a> I also wanted to mention too, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10691.5s">My</a> full police reports are all about bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10694.421s">But</a> I met this other mom yesterday outside of Medford High, someone I've never met before in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10700.724s">I</a> don't know her.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10712.768s">I</a> feel like I've known her for a very long time, even though we've just met yesterday outside of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10719.311s">This</a> is not <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10722.095s">a</a> bond moms should have while their daughters are in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10727.697s">This</a> is not the bond that we should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10730.858s">And</a> I'm grateful for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10733.339s">But</a> this is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10735.72s">It</a> really is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10737.18s">We</a> need to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10739.181s">We</a> need to work together, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10741.822s">I've</a> asked, and I almost messaged the school committee today and said, let me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10748.288s">let</a> me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10749.049s">I'll</a> come to I've been at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10751.11s">I've</a> been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10751.911s">I'll</a> do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10752.591s">I'll</a> do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10753.792s">Just</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10754.653s">I</a> think you all know how persistent I am at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10757.555s">I'm</a> not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10758.536s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10759.917s">I</a> love I believe the blue and white too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10763.58s">I</a> believe it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10764.741s">And</a> I and I want to be proud and I always have been I'm so proud that the football team was here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10769.905s">I</a> we need to we need to recognize all the good that's happening here starting with the teachers, the sports <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10777.405s">the</a> culinary program, the vocational school, all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10780.926s">It</a> needs to be celebrated, but we can't let this other stuff go be swept under the rug anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10786.847s">So</a> thank you again for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10788.408s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11840.24s">Sorry,</a> just to add one thing, and I don't know if I had mentioned it to you, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11844.903s">I</a> can't keep track. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11847.105s">I</a> can look at all my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11849.286s">But</a> the resolution had talked about incidents that Officer Conway could put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11854.31s">I</a> believe it was 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11858.013s">And</a> will that include incident reports within the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11862.496s">Not</a> just the police reports, but student on student violence in the schools that's handled within <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11868.883s">an</a> assistant principal, a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11870.304s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11870.484s">I</a> just want to make sure that that was all included, not just from the SRO because he would only have access.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11877.649s">Cause</a> cause, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11878.51s">Because,</a> um, he can only produce the stuff from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.153s">So,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.634s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.894s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE/2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE.html">Medford City Council Meeting 12-20-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10584.587s">Nicole</a> Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10587.349s">Every</a> time I come to these meetings, I say, I'm not gonna speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10589.811s">And</a> then I listened to what everybody has to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10592.733s">And</a> I take a lot of notes and everybody here makes it pretty easy for me to end up being the, maybe the calm voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10602.08s">Maybe</a> that everybody needs to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10603.401s">Maybe</a> it's the parents and the kids at home that need to hear my voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10606.483s">Maybe</a> it's you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10609.125s">I</a> hope I'm not just hearing myself at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10612.261s">But</a> a lot of things have been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10616.905s">I</a> heard the superintendent say that all hands were on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10622.61s">We</a> need that every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10624.511s">We</a> need all hands on deck every single day for these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10633.739s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli quoted our daughter and our community really has seemed to rally around: Step up <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10642.563s">or</a> step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10645.205s">But</a> there was something else that our daughter said yesterday that impressed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10651.99s">And</a> this morning I sent an email to her teachers and she said, if it weren't for my amazing teachers and my amazing vocational program, I would transfer, I would leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10670.004s">I</a> think that says a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10671.98s">about</a> our staff, about our teachers, about her friends who are dealing with this at her age, right along with her, with their families who have stood by our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10685.905s">It's</a> very impressive to me that the teachers were the ones that were with our kids today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10695.109s">They</a> were the ones that were with our children during that lockdown yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10699.778s">As</a> upset as my daughter was, her teacher took care of her yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10705.5s">Her</a> teacher saved her life on October 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10710.722s">Her</a> teachers saved her life. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10715.283s">I</a> know four by name, there were others in the incident report that I did not know of, but they saved her life. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10726.006s">We're</a> asking a lot of our teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10729.192s">or</a> asking too much, but yet they're rising to the occasion every single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10734.316s">And</a> so are these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10736.458s">These</a> kids are kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10738.699s">We</a> have to be the adults that lead here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10741.041s">We</a> have to be the adults that lead here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10743.383s">So</a> when it comes down to money, there's no dollar amount that should be set on any child. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10752.49s">And</a> I know that in the big picture, we have limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10755.272s">I</a> get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10756.613s">but</a> our teachers, our staff, our students, families, this is what's the most important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10764.74s">I</a> heard many people say that there's been years of bullying, years of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10772.086s">The</a> bullying in our situation started in June, continued in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10778.952s">I</a> have one, two, three, four, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10783.439s">police</a> reports since September for our situation of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10788.4s">And</a> yet the bullying plan that we have was not initiated until the nurse saw my daughter on October 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10802.804s">I</a> want you to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10805.104s">No</a> one filled out that bullying incident report until October 17th when she was on the ground and the nurse asked me, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10813.021s">Is</a> this something that's been going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10815.682s">I</a> said, yes, we've been dealing with this since June. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10819.203s">And</a> she said, I need to write the bullying incident report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10823.044s">I</a> didn't receive it until December 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10827.745s">I</a> asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10828.625s">You</a> all know I asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10829.585s">I</a> asked all of you to help me get that paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10837.607s">So</a> years of bullying have been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10839.128s">And</a> that bullying plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10841.308s">that</a> I sat on a subcommittee meeting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10844.931s">Subcommittee</a> meeting, school committee meeting on December 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10848.993s">And</a> I said, I've never gotten these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10851.755s">I</a> asked if the bullying plan that we were going over was actually something currently that we were using because it was foreign to me in the sense that none of it was executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10866.126s">So</a> what we have in place needs to be followed <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10869.704s">We</a> have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10871.525s">Don't</a> get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10872.405s">We</a> have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10874.526s">We</a> really need to step it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10877.047s">But</a> what we have in place could work if we followed it also. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10881.008s">That</a> has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10882.669s">So</a> I know Councilor Knight, you said maybe cancel school for the rest of the week because no learning will be done, but maybe something just as valuable as learning can be done because <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10898.942s">I</a> noticed today that for our daughter, it was a bit therapeutic to be with her friends, to be with other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10909.265s">I</a> understand why parents or guardians felt that they didn't feel comfortable sending their kids or that kids didn't feel comfortable being at school today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10916.266s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10917.527s">But</a> today was probably the safest day to be at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10922.848s">It</a> certainly wasn't yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10925.049s">And</a> it certainly wasn't October 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10928.155s">I</a> can vouch for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10930.657s">So</a> we have all these good faith discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10932.859s">I</a> heard the words mentioned sustainable solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10940.284s">We</a> need to put our politics aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10942.606s">We</a> really need to put our politics aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10944.607s">We</a> need to all stop arguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10946.148s">I</a> know that I was very emotional last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10951.112s">This</a> whole situation is making me lose my voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10954.555s">But</a> the division is <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10957.168s">is</a> what our kids are seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10961.089s">That's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10962.39s">It's</a> not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10963.39s">They</a> need to see us all united. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10965.171s">And</a> I think that I've been very vocal to everybody that I am willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10971.293s">I</a> have an army of people behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10973.713s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10974.314s">It</a> is amazing to me, the outpouring of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10977.054s">And</a> I thank every single last one of them because it has helped give me the strength and helped give my daughter the strength, our family, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10985.663s">My</a> husband and my son give us the strength to keep moving forward because there's no doubt if I went away, if I went away October 17th, if I pulled her from Mefford High, we'd be here right now, but it wouldn't be about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11003.748s">It</a> would just be another situation and maybe the urgency wouldn't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11007.268s">I</a> don't know why this has all happened to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11011.53s">I</a> really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11014.706s">We</a> can't stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11015.807s">And</a> I just, I beg every single parent to come to every single school committee meeting to join me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11022.59s">I've</a> sat here the first night, an abundance of people, but I've sat here every single meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11028.992s">You</a> all have seen me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11030.173s">I've</a> spoken at your meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11031.173s">I</a> think this is number three here at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11035.515s">We</a> need to hear your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11037.722s">We</a> need to hear voices, parents, because I've heard you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11040.803s">I'm</a> relaying the messages, but I'm just one woman repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11044.624s">We</a> need all of your voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11047.164s">So</a> I also wanted to mention too, my four police reports are all about bullying, but I met this other mom yesterday outside of Medford High, someone I've never met before in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11059.848s">I</a> don't know her. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11061.168s">Between</a> us, we have seven police reports from this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11069.059s">Her</a> story is so similar to mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11071.881s">I</a> feel like I've known her for a very long time, even though we've just met yesterday outside of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11078.426s">This</a> is not a bond moms should have while their daughters are in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11086.833s">This</a> is not the bond that we should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11089.995s">And</a> I'm grateful for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11092.477s">But</a> this is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11094.859s">It</a> really is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11096.32s">We</a> need to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11098.322s">We</a> need to work together, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11100.944s">I've</a> asked, and I almost messaged the school committee today and said, let me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11107.41s">Let</a> me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11108.171s">I've</a> been at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11110.252s">I've</a> been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11111.053s">I'll</a> do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11112.154s">I'll</a> do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11112.935s">Just</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11113.776s">I</a> think you all know how persistent I am at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11116.678s">I</a> am not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11117.679s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11119.06s">I</a> love, I believe the blue and white too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11122.723s">I</a> believe it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11123.857s">And</a> I wanna be proud, and I always have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11126.579s">I'm</a> so proud that the football team was here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11129.24s">We</a> need to recognize all the good that's happening here, starting with the teachers, the sports, the culinary program, the vocational school, all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11140.067s">It</a> needs to be celebrated, but we can't let this other stuff be swept under the rug anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11145.99s">So</a> thank you again for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=11147.551s">Let</a> me stand here with you.

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11678.722s">Uncomfortable</a> is watching your daughter walk into school every day and know that she she's sad because she got hurt and she's scared Uncomfortable is how she must have felt that day on the floor This doesn't get easier 51 days later this is something that I I said to someone earlier I will never get over that over this and all the days of the rest of my life because this is my child This is my child <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11710.507s">So</a> this is uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11714.089s">It</a> might be uncomfortable for you to vote on this or make your peace, but this is uncomfortable and it's not getting any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11723.795s">I</a> need everybody's help. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11725.096s">I</a> need everybody's support. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11728.058s">Someone</a> also said to me, you have hundreds, if not thousands of people standing behind you, but what elected official is going to take the lead and stand in front of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11739.843s">Wow,</a> I thought, wow, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11742.484s">I</a> can lead everybody behind me, but who's gonna step up? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11747.085s">I</a> need everybody to step up for the safety of our kids, not just for mine, not just for mine, for every child, for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11758.507s">So</a> there has been one consistent, I mean, there's been many consistent people who have supported us and one has been the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11769.402s">her</a> teachers have been amazing, amazing, and they have validated every single one of our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11778.087s">They've</a> listened to me, they've communicated tirelessly to make sure that she's okay and that I know she's okay every single day, that we're getting through it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11789.953s">So</a> I guess my question is after 51 days, why, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11797.66s">yesterday</a> was the first time that I heard from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11801.261s">Why</a> was today... I just mean, today it was 3.30 we were on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11812.185s">This</a> meeting was at seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11814.265s">And</a> I asked you one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11815.666s">I</a> said, could you just look at that video of what I said at the school committee meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11819.247s">Because</a> I'm not sure you know what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11822.508s">And</a> I hung up with you and three seconds later, I got a voicemail from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11827.019s">I</a> haven't heard one thing from any of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11830.141s">And</a> I'm not trying to point you out and say you were wrong or whatnot, but it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11836.746s">And</a> what I need everybody to do right now is the right thing for my family, for our city, for our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11846.774s">We</a> only get one shot here with our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11848.855s">I</a> only have one shot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11852.899s">This</a> is my one shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11854.42s">And</a> people keep saying how strong I am or how brave I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11857.401s">This</a> is really uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11859.382s">I've</a> had to put myself out everywhere to protect my child.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11874.308s">Going</a> to parent-teacher conference the other night, we walked through the overpass that we walked through 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11880.17s">And</a> I said, wow, it's still just as cold here. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11883.216s">in</a> this overpass.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11898.249s">That</a> video of my daughter being attacked was sent to me before I even started my car to get to Medford High School.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11934.352s">We</a> need to do better, not just for me, not just for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11938.056s">I</a> can lead everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11938.916s">I</a> can say a million great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11940.218s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11941.479s">But</a> if nothing changes, then what does this show? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11945.443s">What</a> does this show the kids who have the unexpected behavior? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11949.747s">What</a> does it show them? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11951.088s">And</a> my God, what does it show the kids that are doing the right thing and having this done to them?
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11964.109s">If</a> you don't like this policy, then what's your proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11967.572s">What's</a> your proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11970.875s">What's</a> your proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11974.157s">You</a> can say no to this all day, but then what's your proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11978.541s">Can</a> you write a proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11979.542s">Can</a> the three of you get together and maybe make a plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11981.864s">Because</a> these three got together and made a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11984.566s">They</a> wrote something. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11985.426s">It</a> says right here, Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpell, thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12190.335s">And</a> I think just to add, and I said it to you, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12195.813s">We</a> can't be reactive anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12198.015s">Even</a> about the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12199.876s">Now</a> we're gonna ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12202.439s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12203.039s">Why</a> are we always so reactive? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12205.081s">Why</a> can't we be proactive? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12206.782s">Put</a> something in place that's proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12210.505s">Don't</a> let this happen to another family. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12213.328s">Because</a> what if the family isn't as strong as ours? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12216.19s">What</a> happens to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12217.611s">What</a> if a child can't go home and talk to their parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12220.848s">I</a> am so blessed that we have the relationship that we do with our daughter, that she was open with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12226.738s">I</a> wish you that for your baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12229.218s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12230.199s">I</a> really, I wish that for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12232.621s">I</a> wish that for every parent that they had that open conversation, but I'm really worried about the people that don't know how this is supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12244.17s">I've</a> done a lot of research. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12245.571s">I've</a> worked in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12247.533s">I'm</a> versed in the lingo that's in the school system versus the lingo out of the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12254.479s">I'm</a> blessed in that way, but not everybody is. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12258.522s">We</a> can't help what happened to my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12260.963s">I'm</a> not sure something else is going to happen either. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12263.265s">So</a> I need to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12264.986s">I</a> need you all to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12266.527s">So</a> if it needs to go to the committee of the whole, if there's something that I can do to help, I'll do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12272.35s">I'll</a> support all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12273.691s">If</a> you support my family, the teachers, and I don't mean just contract, I mean like teachers that are on the ground that have their opinion that can't go up and speak just, hi, I'm a teacher that I wanted to say that this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12287.056s">you</a> know, a problem in our school, I had to apply, you know, I felt like I needed to apply to speak at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12294.462s">I</a> needed to send to the school committee and to the superintendent who I've been in meetings with, who I didn't feel like I had the full support of, the superintendent, read my words before anybody could say to me, sure, yeah, you can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12312.538s">It's,</a> that was a horrible feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12314.818s">It</a> was a horrible feeling that I felt like it had to be studied first and okayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12320.9s">I</a> poured my heart out into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12322.54s">Like</a> I poured out my heart every single time that I've spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12325.341s">I'm</a> not saying, you know, I feel like what I'm asking should not be a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12335.342s">I</a> need people to be proactive to protect our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12339.152s">to</a> protect the safety of all at school every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12342.453s">It</a> should be just common sense at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12346.675s">So</a> listen to the teachers, find out what they need on the ground there. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12352.997s">Because</a> there's a lot of things happening at the school that I'm hearing about that you, everybody in the city should know about as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12364.481s">It</a> shouldn't be dangerous to send your child to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12370.053s">and</a> certainly should not land them in the emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12374.254s">So</a> I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12376.435s">Like</a> I've said, I am willing to help in any single way. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12380.897s">I</a> was on the subcommittee meeting for the school committee earlier about bullying prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12386.198s">I'll</a> do whatever it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12388.439s">Ask</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12389.139s">I</a> think by now the city knows I'm persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12393.261s">So</a> I will continue to be persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12394.741s">I'm</a> not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12396.402s">I'm</a> going to stand up for every child, my child, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12400.617s">every</a> single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12402.097s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=319.944s">Hi,</a> it's Nicole Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=321.325s">I</a> can't give my address. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=324.685s">And</a> it's saying I can't start my video because the host has disabled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=328.406s">So</a> just so you know.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=355.007s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=355.768s">Sorry,</a> is it too bright, too dark? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=357.448s">I</a> couldn't get on the laptop. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=358.809s">So</a> we're trying everything here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=360.31s">It's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=362.731s">So</a> I just wanted to say that I've read this multiple times and I think the thing that really took my breath away about it is that it wasn't followed in my case for my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=381.32s">I</a> have never seen <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=384.721s">this</a> bullying incident report form. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=390.544s">And</a> I think when I saw this, it kind of caught me off guard that I didn't even know that this existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=395.447s">I</a> mean, I don't think there's anybody on here that doesn't know our story at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=402.531s">So</a> I think that that was, you know, it took my breath away. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=407.293s">And</a> I know from the documentation that I have <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=412.833s">from</a> the communications from the superintendent and from the principal that a bully investigation was never done. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=421.377s">So</a> I think everything that I've read in the actual plan is great, but we can have all the plans and all the rules and all the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=436.504s">And</a> I think I've said this 8 million times, we can have all of these things, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=442.093s">but</a> if we're not following through, it all means nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=446.416s">And</a> so, you know, I've highlighted some things in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=450.958s">I</a> don't want to be the only one that talks the only time because, you know, you all deserve a voice, but we have fallen under many of the categories here that are the definition of bullying.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=480.012s">We</a> have incident reports, but that is being reactive in our situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=487.837s">And</a> maybe if some of this paperwork was done initially with some of our complaints, that maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=499.062s">we</a> wouldn't be on our fourth police report at this time.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=513.449s">So</a> I think, in my case, and I think that I've probably been the most vocal person about everything that's happened to our child. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=528.052s">But</a> there are other people out there that I'm sure have had terrible things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=531.994s">And</a> where do they end up too? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=537.857s">So</a> it's not just about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=539.277s">It's</a> not just about my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=541.658s">This</a> is a big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=543.759s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure that that was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=548.501s">And</a> obviously, like always, I am more than willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=555.18s">and</a> do anything I can for the future of our city, for my daughter's future, for, you know, Medford means a lot to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=564.325s">Medford</a> High means a lot to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=566.026s">My</a> daughter means the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=568.327s">So,</a> you know, I think it was just sad to see this form and know that it was never a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=578.552s">You</a> know, there was never an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=580.333s">There</a> was never a bullying form filled out until the day my daughter was attacked. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=585.31s">the</a> nurse wrote something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=589.252s">By</a> then, we were already at the emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=592.533s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that is stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=596.575s">And</a> I'm sorry, my dog keeps barking, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=599.716s">But</a> I just want to make sure that that's noted.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3912.924s">One,</a> um, I worked in a responsive classroom for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3917.506s">Um,</a> I think it's definitely imperative that we have responsive classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3922.889s">I've</a> sat in close to 180 nexus classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3926.69s">Um,</a> it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3930.952s">I</a> do think that it's great for the kids that are in elementary school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3937.344s">But</a> I do feel that as we get to the high school, that there is a little bit more of a disconnect. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3942.668s">Some</a> of the wording, I don't think many kids in high school are gonna go to, let's just say Mr. DeLaver and say, I'm feeling like I'm in the red zone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3951.914s">Or</a> I feel like I'm having rock brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3954.836s">Those</a> are some of the terms that we use in elementary school, which are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3959.819s">But</a> I don't feel like as we get a little bit older and we're feeling a little bit more, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3966.035s">maybe</a> confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3968.237s">Um,</a> you know, I think kids think they know everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3971.139s">Um,</a> but I think some of that is not going to be used as they grow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3979.627s">Um,</a> I think from what I've seen at the middle school, um, I can't agree with Mr. Tucci enough that he is so proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3991.116s">Um,</a> and I think that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3993.885s">that</a> really needs to be carried out through all of the school years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=3999.127s">We</a> need to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4003.789s">I</a> think the wording, you know, and even Mr. Rossell, you just said, I feel sorrow for those needing to know all 38 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4014.113s">I</a> read all 38 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4016.834s">I</a> read it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4019.355s">I</a> did exactly what you did before going to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4024.713s">I</a> highlighted every single thing in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4028.474s">And</a> I feel like when you're a leader at our school, it is your job to study these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4036.837s">So</a> is there sorrow that there has to be 38 pages of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4041.298s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4043.039s">Does</a> some have to be included law-wise, policy-wise, plan-wise? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4047.827s">but</a> I don't know what parts we cut out besides duplicate, because there's a lot of duplicate information there, because I did turn back and say, oh my God, am I reading the same thing twice or am I going there? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4056.311s">I</a> was late. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4058.973s">But</a> I feel like if we don't cover every base, it could be the one wording or one sentence that could matter in someone's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4073.42s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4077.492s">Like</a> I said, elementary school responsive classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4079.633s">I</a> worked in a responsive classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4080.734s">This</a> is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4082.895s">I</a> don't ever, there there's no bad children. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4084.957s">There's</a> a lot of unexpected behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4088.078s">Um,</a> so that's part of the wording, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4091.4s">Expected.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4091.881s">Oh,</a> that was very unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4093.041s">This</a> is very expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4094.722s">Um,</a> I think that we need to see a lot more expected behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4098.985s">Um,</a> but I think it needs to be pushed up to, um, the upper levels where kids think that they're going to rule and they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4107.432s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure that that was out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4110.533s">And</a> as always, whatever you need for me to help move forward with policies or plans or anything in between, I'm more than happy to work with anybody and everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/NndFNuozZb4&t=4119.857s">So</a> thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_PB78UXxOSC0/2024-11-19_PB78UXxOSC0.html">City Council 11-29-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3013.728s">Sorry,</a> I'm pretty much the loudest person I know, so- I know that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3231.186s">What</a> would have happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3234.448s">I've</a> learned from many sources that cutting classes and hiding in bathrooms is a regular occurrence at Medford High for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3243.216s">It's</a> not always followed up by our administration for consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3249.12s">No</a> doubt they are overwhelmed, but I refuse to make excuses for the adults who have a job to do to ensure all of our children's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3261.228s">We</a> all own a part in this, each of you, our city officials, school staff, and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3268.653s">We</a> need to show our students that there are consequences for their actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3275.539s">There's</a> nothing more I want than to work with the superintendent and her administration to ensure our daughter's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3282.381s">Although</a> we have had some communication in one meeting, unfortunately, I have had multiple emails not returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3289.803s">I</a> requested paperwork that had a 10-day deadline, not by me, but by law, and it was not received. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3297.665s">I've</a> been given dates by Medford High School admin of when the paperwork would be ready, and yet these dates have also passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3306.447s">I've</a> been told one of my daughter's attackers was removed from a class when she was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3311.71s">I</a> have been told that they were suspended indefinitely at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3317.773s">They</a> were not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3320.394s">I</a> was assured they never crossed paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3322.395s">They</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3322.795s">I</a> was assured they never entered CAF II, which is exactly where they entered the day that they attacked my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3332.48s">No</a> school administration even thought to reach out to the other family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3336.767s">knowing</a> that their child was on the football team on Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3340.488s">And</a> there, yet again, they tried to attack my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3347.709s">It's</a> negligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3350.73s">Disregarding</a> the rules is starting at the top of our school chain, so no wonder some students are not following the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3360.052s">School</a> administration must be the leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3364.753s">They</a> must set a better example. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3367.585s">I</a> hope the example that I'm setting for my daughter is a good one, to always stand up for what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3374.169s">And</a> I also hope you will stand with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3377.11s">I'm</a> willing to help in any way, any solution that I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3381.333s">I'm</a> open to every suggestion on how to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3386.636s">I</a> wanna work with our city officials, the school, our teachers, they are so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3393.117s">They</a> are beloved, and they deserve to have every child be able to thrive in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3398.961s">What</a> is allowed in our schools sets the standard in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3403.625s">And</a> I appreciate you listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3406.146s">I</a> thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3408.688s">And</a> I would appreciate any solutions that you may have for me going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3413.351s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2022-11-09_qi5mNKAxLlE/2022-11-09_qi5mNKAxLlE.html">Medford School Committee - Regular Meeting - 11.7.2022</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6426.863s">Nicole</a> Branley, our address is on file, but needs to be omitted publicly due to our safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6434.929s">This</a> is my first time speaking at a meeting, and I want to thank you all for this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6439.072s">I</a> have heard from the mayor personally, and I appreciate your story and your time, each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6446.917s">Mr.</a> Russo, you must have lost my email address because I have not heard from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6452.472s">My</a> husband and I have been lifelong Medford residents and have always been proud to be raising our family here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6458.695s">We</a> both attended Method Public Schools and graduated Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6462.777s">There</a> was never a second guess in sending our children to public school here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6474.042s">Sadly,</a> my daughter encountered some very alarming and repetitive acts of harassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6483.041s">Bullying</a> and threats at the high school, which led to a vicious physical assault that sent her to the hospital on October 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6493.93s">I'm</a> not here to speak specifically about her situation, but more of the broader scope of what my eyes have been open to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6502.236s">Safety</a> in our schools is imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6506.36s">News</a> reports of mass shootings that have inflicted on our most vulnerable, our innocent children are everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6513.237s">But</a> not until my own daughter's horror story began in June, did I ever really consider that the child sitting next to her would be such a one-on-one threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6522.626s">But</a> that is exactly what happened when she was attacked two-on-one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6528.833s">So</a> many people reached out to us when news got around what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6532.176s">Sadly,</a> many shared their own bullying stories with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6536.874s">I'm</a> sorry that they had to go through that, but I know that the apology does not have to come from me, but it should come from their bully, from their attacker, and from our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6558.709s">I</a> have heard from countless Method public school victims of bullying in the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6563.252s">Every</a> story has been more horrifying than the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6566.923s">This</a> is not a new issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6568.584s">As</a> a mom, I know how these mothers feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6575.628s">Helpless,</a> angry, heartbroken, and terrified to send their child back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6589.235s">I</a> worry too about the students who don't feel comfortable going to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6594.85s">or</a> even to their parents or guardians to say what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6599.593s">What</a> about them? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6602.695s">I</a> was the ultra proactive mom in our situation and this violence still occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6610.439s">What</a> is the breaking point here? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6614.161s">What</a> about the long-term effects of this on our victims? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6617.984s">My</a> daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6621.846s">At</a> one point, at one point during the last few weeks, I realized something even more horrifying, that our daughter will carry this story with her through her whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6643.481s">One</a> friend told me about her bully in a Method elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6647.203s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6651.567s">back</a> when she was 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6655.689s">She</a> is now 53 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6659.51s">She</a> asked me not to share her specific story publicly, but fear that her bully still lives in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6672.856s">42</a> years have gone by for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6674.096s">42,</a> and she still is in fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6681.249s">Our</a> school system let her down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6684.35s">They</a> let our family down and countless others. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6692.292s">I</a> have heard so many stories this week that bullies or aggressors that are in a fight have actually returned to school from their punishments before the victim could heal from the injuries in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6705.495s">That</a> is backwards and it needs to change.
 <p>[Nicole Branley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6722.297s">Not</a> all the stories I have heard have been under your administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6728.021s">Or</a> during the time of your elected positions, but our story is and so are countless others. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6734.805s">Although</a> you cannot change the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6738.568s">You</a> certainly need to step up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6741.509s">Medford</a> can be the example of the school district that set the bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6746.562s">Our</a> school should be on the news for positive stories, not ones of violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6752.327s">I</a> am hoping moving forward, we could work together to actually make sure the policies we have in place are sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6758.932s">And</a> if so, that they are being implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6761.995s">I</a> think it's long overdue that children see consequences for their bullying, harassing and fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6768.4s">Maybe</a> if students know they will be held accountable and consequences are imminent, that they will think twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6776.457s">Even</a> more importantly, that no one else has to be a victim of such a crime and that students who choose to use their fists and hateful words to solve problems actually see consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6787.521s">If</a> zero tolerance is stated as part of our Mustang way, then follow through has to be too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6795.945s">Actions</a> speak louder than words and the students know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6800.647s">They</a> know it's only lip service from you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6804.366s">It</a> is our job as the adults to set the standards for what we are willing to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6811.008s">What</a> is allowed in our school defines the morals of the city and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6826.692s">I've</a> done a lot of reading in the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6830.113s">And</a> in our own handbook, it says following policies, <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6834.133s">are</a> consistent with the mission statement to set expectations for students and to offer them considerable motivation and support as a way to help them become responsible citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6847.602s">The</a> time is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6850.884s">I</a> make a vow in front of all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6853.145s">I</a> will help be a part of the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6856.247s">Tell</a> me what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6857.408s">Tell</a> me what I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6858.909s">Tell</a> me where I can sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6861.479s">Do</a> you need more funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6863.299s">Tell</a> me who I need to contact, because I will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6866.76s">Do</a> we need another assistant principal? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6870.361s">The</a> relationships we have built with the school resource officer has been a great one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6876.122s">Could</a> we have maybe one more to help him try to cover multiple buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6887.604s">Help</a> him cover multiple buildings and over 1,200 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6891.496s">Can</a> you type up a clear policy that every child actually has to read and sign every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6896.158s">There's</a> gotta be options. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6898.339s">Can</a> we make clear that prom, sports, homecoming, that those are privileges and they could lose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6904.661s">Students</a> need routine, they need encouragement, they need love, they need discipline, and they need a hard line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6912.604s">So</a> draw the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6916.966s">What</a> are you specifically going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6920.683s">starting</a> now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6922.925s">Maybe</a> our school committee members should start walking the halls of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6937.137s">Maybe</a> you can spend some time in the cafeteria at lunch or check in on a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6944.023s">I</a> wholeheartedly agree that every child has a right to a public education <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6950.444s">We</a> have exemplary teachers in our district implementing amazing curriculum while nurturing our students to be the best they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6961.65s">If</a> no expulsions are set forth, then we need to be able to find solutions and education plans for aggressors in an alternative school setting, especially away from the victims to ensure safety for all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6986.317s">Introducing</a> violent bullies back into the corridors with their victim is assaulting them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6991.567s">Only</a> this time, you will be the bully. <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6994.894s">Thank</a> you.
