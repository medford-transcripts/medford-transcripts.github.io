    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14287.977s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14290.399s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14298.666s">[Teixeira]</a>: Unlike the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in the language group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14310.356s">[Teixeira]</a>: During that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14318.68s">[Teixeira]</a>: Year two, it was a 50-50 split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14321.001s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then year three, it was 20% in the target language and 80%, I'm sorry, 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14331.725s">[Teixeira]</a>: We don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14337.128s">[Teixeira]</a>: We have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14346.412s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we don't know what their requirements will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14349.193s">[Teixeira]</a>: We don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14351.714s">[Teixeira]</a>: really what their guidance will be with programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14355.155s">[Teixeira]</a>: It doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written, is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14361.936s">[Teixeira]</a>: We can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14370.098s">[Teixeira]</a>: So as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14379.52s">[Teixeira]</a>: highest number of speakers at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14383.283s">[Teixeira]</a>: Our high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14390.407s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, you know, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14472.663s">[Teixeira]</a>: Well, when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14487.515s">[Teixeira]</a>: And those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14491.439s">[Teixeira]</a>: The teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14496.923s">[Teixeira]</a>: kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14506.695s">[Teixeira]</a>: But the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14560.071s">[Teixeira]</a>: And like I said, that's done informally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14561.892s">[Teixeira]</a>: There's not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14579.476s">[Teixeira]</a>: I would wait until guidance comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14581.518s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will, you know, come out with their guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14593.727s">[Teixeira]</a>: But I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14617.747s">[Teixeira]</a>: It's based on um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14619.748s">[Teixeira]</a>: WIDA testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14626.13s">[Teixeira]</a>: So students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, you know, just arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14634.492s">[Teixeira]</a>: Other students, you know, that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14658.709s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'd have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14672.355s">[Teixeira]</a>: I know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14756.584s">[Teixeira]</a>: It's intense, it's a 40 hour course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14766.797s">[Teixeira]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14767.737s">[Teixeira]</a>: And it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14774.741s">[Teixeira]</a>: So like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14781.005s">[Teixeira]</a>: It has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6702.639s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6724.746s">[Teixeira]</a>: Uh, during that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7026.759s">[Teixeira]</a>: Well, those levels are based on what we do as a screener test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7031.202s">[Teixeira]</a>: When the students arrive, it's based on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7437.637s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7438.298s">[Teixeira]</a>: I will be quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7439.18s">[Teixeira]</a>: It's like 9,000 degrees in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7444.709s">[Teixeira]</a>: Sorry, I have to start the projector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7489.668s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7492.688s">[Teixeira]</a>: The EL department had a successful summer, or successful summer programs, and that was thanks to the support of May Abu Hassan, Ghislaine Pinto, Emma Rangel, Laney Cahill, Amanda Davis, Teresa Casagnetti, and David York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7509.243s">[Teixeira]</a>: I ran three concurrent programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7511.925s">[Teixeira]</a>: High school students were able to take summer classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7515.387s">[Teixeira]</a>: to make up missed credits or get extra credits during the summer to help with graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7520.549s">[Teixeira]</a>: It was all funded through the Title III grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7523.691s">[Teixeira]</a>: Middle school students had five weeks of project-based enrichment activities, and they focused on social studies and science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7533.895s">[Teixeira]</a>: Each week, the Yale Summer Enrichment Program had a theme with a culminating field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7538.817s">[Teixeira]</a>: So the first week was learning about Massachusetts history,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7544.054s">[Teixeira]</a>: They got to learn interesting facts, the geography of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7548.015s">[Teixeira]</a>: The week ended with a mini civics lesson and a trip to the State House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7553.956s">[Teixeira]</a>: Students had the unique opportunity to view government, both past and present, here in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7562.398s">[Teixeira]</a>: In the second week of the program, students researched famous bridges and structures from around the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7568.697s">[Teixeira]</a>: They learned the engineering design process, and the project ended with an in-house field trip from Rita Advani.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7575.202s">[Teixeira]</a>: She's a scientist and engineer who helped the students construct bridges, beams, and columns with paper products and tested weight loads with textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7585.07s">[Teixeira]</a>: Everything was created with paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7587.592s">[Teixeira]</a>: Students designed their own bridges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7589.693s">[Teixeira]</a>: They did the weight loads using nuts and bolts to determine what load could be handled on their bridges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7599.929s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then the third week of the program focused on rules of the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7604.01s">[Teixeira]</a>: In the classroom, students learned grammar, vocabulary, number graphing, developing step-by-step, developing and following step-by-step instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7614.252s">[Teixeira]</a>: And the week ended with a game day in the courtyard at MHS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7618.573s">[Teixeira]</a>: Students played Paper Battleship, Cornhole, Headbands, and Yahtzee, Giant Jenga.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7627.396s">[Teixeira]</a>: During the fourth and fifth weeks of the program, students learned about oceans and marine life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7631.897s">[Teixeira]</a>: They researched endangered species, analyzed the reasons for near extinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7636.699s">[Teixeira]</a>: The project ended with a field trip to the New England Aquarium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7644.263s">[Teixeira]</a>: The third program was Starbase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7647.044s">[Teixeira]</a>: This is our second year with our partnership with Starbase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7650.635s">[Teixeira]</a>: and that's a STEM lab at Hanscom Air Force Base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7653.938s">[Teixeira]</a>: So students got to design crash test cars, and they worked in teams to choose three safety features to a modified matchbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7665.146s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then they crashed their car with an egg to determine which safety features would be the most effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7672.511s">[Teixeira]</a>: They got to pick the safety features.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7674.333s">[Teixeira]</a>: They could only use items that were available in the lab.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7678.595s">[Teixeira]</a>: Then students designed robot cars and they had to code, write the code to program them to have them go around the track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7688.421s">[Teixeira]</a>: They had to start and stop in the right place on the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7691.382s">[Teixeira]</a>: They had to stay on the track as well as calculate all of the turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7697.461s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then these robot cars were kind of transformers that grew some arms and legs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7703.265s">[Teixeira]</a>: And the students had to program these cars to travel on the surface of the moon and pick up garbage and throw it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7710.711s">[Teixeira]</a>: And students wrote the code to move, lift, and drop the trash into the designated areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7717.215s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then students made their own derby cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7720.256s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then they raced them using CO2 propulsion, and they made predictions on which cars would go fast based on design and design elements, again, going back to the engineering design process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7732.866s">[Teixeira]</a>: All of this was covered under the Title III grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7740.114s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then it happens at Hanscom Air Force Base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7743.077s">[Teixeira]</a>: We're not drafting students for the military, but this is where the STEM lab happens to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7747.982s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so students got to see a parade, and they also have people come in to talk about STEM careers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7755.069s">[Teixeira]</a>: That's also part of the program that they get to take part in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7769.059s">[Teixeira]</a>: I would have to look, but the males definitely, I think it's probably, one, two, three, four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7779.383s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'd say six to three, so six males, three females.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7785.526s">[Teixeira]</a>: Although, there were 11 students in the program, so I don't know where some are right now in this picture, but I can look up the data for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7796.656s">[Teixeira]</a>: Any questions on the summer programming before we move on to the next part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7803.438s">[Teixeira]</a>: So for the enrollment data, last January I gave a presentation on the enrollment numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7809.28s">[Teixeira]</a>: And as I explained back then, we have a pretty fluid population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7812.321s">[Teixeira]</a>: It changes from year to year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7814.349s">[Teixeira]</a>: week to week basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7815.71s">[Teixeira]</a>: At one point in the district, at one point we had 500 English learners and then that changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7822.235s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then of course in June we have our end of year meetings to determine placement and that changes the numbers for the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7830.923s">[Teixeira]</a>: I did look it up and last year we reclassified 88 students in the district as from being English learners to being former English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7841.656s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so that obviously brought our starting numbers down in this September because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7850.501s">[Teixeira]</a>: But the Parent Information Center is registering new students and new families are coming in every day and it's still happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7858.005s">[Teixeira]</a>: So I just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7863.001s">[Teixeira]</a>: put this together to give you that moment in time for new enrollments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7867.083s">[Teixeira]</a>: So September 18th, 2018, we had tested 165 students, and of those 165 students, 110 qualified for services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7869.945s">[Teixeira]</a>: September 18th, 2019, this year, we tested 211 students, and of those 211, 138 are English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7873.407s">[Teixeira]</a>: So these are our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7889.787s">[Teixeira]</a>: for this point in time in terms of new enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7892.269s">[Teixeira]</a>: But this also doesn't count students who have transferred in from other districts that we have scores for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7897.674s">[Teixeira]</a>: If they had taken access in their previous district, we don't test them upon intake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7901.597s">[Teixeira]</a>: So the number of Yale students is slightly higher than that 138 for new students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7909.992s">[Teixeira]</a>: There are also, as of the writing of this, there are currently eight students waiting to be medically cleared, and I don't know how many students are still somewhere in the registration pipeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7918.675s">[Teixeira]</a>: But most new enrollments at this point in time through the Parent Information Center are English learner families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7925.36s">[Teixeira]</a>: I also want to take a moment to acknowledge Jessie Reinhold, who's the assessment specialist for the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7932.223s">[Teixeira]</a>: Jessie is welcoming to our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7934.563s">[Teixeira]</a>: She's exemplary at her job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7937.084s">[Teixeira]</a>: She takes time with each family and with each student that she tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7942.486s">[Teixeira]</a>: She's extremely detail-oriented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7944.327s">[Teixeira]</a>: She makes placement decisions with 100% accuracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7947.828s">[Teixeira]</a>: And she's a tremendous asset to the EL department and to the EL families in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7952.53s">[Teixeira]</a>: I couldn't do this without her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7954.571s">[Teixeira]</a>: And these 211 tests, it's a four-domain test, reading, writing, listening, and speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7961.855s">[Teixeira]</a>: The test can take upwards of three hours per student, especially if they're in high school and they have English and we have to administer the math test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7971.279s">[Teixeira]</a>: So she does this single-handedly, and it's pretty amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7974.36s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm lucky to have her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7977.946s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then the last part of the report is Lesley University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7981.508s">[Teixeira]</a>: This is my second year with the partnership that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7984.17s">[Teixeira]</a>: And this is different from the district's partnership with Lesley University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7989.273s">[Teixeira]</a>: We get, it's the Elementary Education Urban Initiative, EEUI program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7996.498s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so the teachers in this program are in a master's program to get elementary ed certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8002.062s">[Teixeira]</a>: And they get an add-on EL license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8004.264s">[Teixeira]</a>: And how they do that is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8006.607s">[Teixeira]</a>: by doing a year-long internship in one of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8010.249s">[Teixeira]</a>: So last year we had two interns, Emma Rangel and Lisa Petri, and we actually hired Emma to fill a retirement at the McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8021.616s">[Teixeira]</a>: She's sixth grade certified, so, and that comes in with the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8026.872s">[Teixeira]</a>: partnership that I have with Nick Tucci and Faiza Khan with shifting the math program over to co-teaching as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8036.003s">[Teixeira]</a>: That allowed us to have co-teaching in both science and math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8042.57s">[Teixeira]</a>: The math is new this year, but we're also continuing with the professional development we gave to the teachers last year, the science and EL teachers on co-teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8050.296s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we'll go into year two of that, and then math teachers will run concurrently with that as year one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8057.862s">[Teixeira]</a>: So the Lesley program gives us the opportunity to basically get second year teachers who have been trained by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8065.208s">[Teixeira]</a>: The best teachers we have, we use Christine Hingston, who is at the Roberts, was one of the teachers who mentored one of the candidates, and then Teresa Casagnetti was the other, who also mentored Emma, who we ended up hiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8083.034s">[Teixeira]</a>: So it's kind of a win-win program, where we get a pool of teachers who have been trained by our best teachers to come into the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8095.824s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then this year we have two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8097.927s">[Teixeira]</a>: One is at the Brooks School this year working with mainstream classroom teacher, Suzanne Sarami, and Allie Kennedy, an EL teacher, and then Christine Hingston has another intern in her program at the Roberts this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8132.214s">[Teixeira]</a>: Which one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8132.934s">[Teixeira]</a>: The Starbase or the enrichment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8135.817s">[Teixeira]</a>: Both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8136.417s">[Teixeira]</a>: Yes, I mean so the biggest struggle is finding teachers to do the program and that's again why I wanted to make sure I acknowledged everybody because without them there wouldn't have been a summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8147.645s">[Teixeira]</a>: It was a struggle trying to find a teacher to do the entire five weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8151.849s">[Teixeira]</a>: So then that's when we kind of brainstormed and came up with the idea of doing theme weeks and different teachers did the different weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8159.295s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so that worked out really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8161.057s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so hopefully we can just expand on that next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=520.386s">[Teixeira]</a>: I am the other Paul in the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=521.788s">[Teixeira]</a>: My name is Paul Tispera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=523.249s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm the director for English learners and I was on the hybrid committee putting together the hybrid schedule and logistics for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=533.868s">[Teixeira]</a>: And I'll turn it over to Joan Bowen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=557.596s">[Teixeira]</a>: And we see Toni.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=559.896s">[Teixeira]</a>: I think she's having connectivity issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=923.908s">[Teixeira]</a>: Dr. Cushing, I can answer the second part of this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=926.87s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if a student has been in a hybrid classroom, they would continue on that path during the quarantine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=933.996s">[Teixeira]</a>: They wouldn't jump into the remote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=936.618s">[Teixeira]</a>: At least that's the plan at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=939.74s">[Teixeira]</a>: Keep in mind, this is still a draft, and this is why we're looking for feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=944.213s">[Teixeira]</a>: But we feel it's best for the student to maintain that consistency with the cohort of students, with the work that they're doing, and do that on a remote basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=955.563s">[Teixeira]</a>: So they wouldn't switch from like hybrid to the full remote if they're ill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=959.706s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then also it's different for every student how, you know, to the level of illness they may have if they're not capable of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=967.914s">[Teixeira]</a>: jumping in and doing the work because they need the rest and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=972.265s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we would keep the students where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=998.689s">[Teixeira]</a>: So for this question, we decided to look at the chunks of instruction in four to six week periods and reassess at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1036.371s">[Teixeira]</a>: And I think we may have lost Tom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1038.257s">[Teixeira]</a>: So I'm just going to go to the comment section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1160.812s">[Teixeira]</a>: And with the hybrid model, the way it was set up is we divided the, you know, we would be dividing the students into two cohorts, cohort one and cohort two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1170.478s">[Teixeira]</a>: Cohort one will be in school on Mondays and Tuesdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1174.098s">[Teixeira]</a>: and they will do their independent asynchronous learning on Thursdays and Fridays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1178.984s">[Teixeira]</a>: The teacher will then be with cohort two on Thursday, Friday for the live in-person instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1184.731s">[Teixeira]</a>: And the students in cohort two would do their asynchronous learning on Monday, Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1189.817s">[Teixeira]</a>: Wednesday is a remote day for everyone and this is an opportunity for the teachers to bring cohort one and cohort two together because that is the full makeup of the classroom for some remote live instruction for the students because that will support students with whichever direction we end up going into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1209.644s">[Teixeira]</a>: If we end up having to go full remote because the governor does another shutdown, the students will have had experience with the remote learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1217.777s">[Teixeira]</a>: from their teacher and that would be their class, or if things get better and we can return to school full time, those students will be able to have had opportunities to interact with the other students in the other cohort, which is the makeup of their class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1258.612s">[Teixeira]</a>: I can talk about what we did at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1262.878s">[Teixeira]</a>: Joan, you were part of the high school, but at the elementary level, we're doing an asynchronous schedule for the elementary students when they're home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1272.148s">[Teixeira]</a>: And we're giving them the amount of time that they should be spending doing their asynchronous learning for each class on the days that they're home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1282.119s">[Teixeira]</a>: Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1517.623s">[Teixeira]</a>: There's a question about Monday, Tuesday holidays and how that would impact in the hybrid model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1524.185s">[Teixeira]</a>: At least for the first half of the year, we did count out and the Monday, Tuesday group would have one less day than the Thursday, Friday group because we have Monday holidays, we have a Tuesday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1541.012s">[Teixeira]</a>: the election day, but then in November, and we're not sure how long this will extend into, we have the Thursday, Friday for the Thanksgiving break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1550.058s">[Teixeira]</a>: So it's evenly balanced with the exception of one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1601.278s">[Teixeira]</a>: can't guarantee that at this point in time because we don't know what the structure will look like and we can't say every lesson is going to be recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1610.046s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if the student is absent and attendance will be taken, they would make up the work like they typically would if they had missed a day of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1618.433s">[Teixeira]</a>: But school times and class times are not optional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1624.086s">[Teixeira]</a>: like they were, you know, it was a little bit less structured in the spring with the abrupt closure of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=1633.009s">[Teixeira]</a>: But this is a school day and the school times are something that, you know, teachers and students all have to adhere to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3442.942s">[Teixeira]</a>: There was a question about recess that I can address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3446.664s">[Teixeira]</a>: The recess schedules will be made by the building principals, but when we did the hybrid schedule, we did allot time for recess to coincide with lunch for all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3459.15s">[Teixeira]</a>: And, you know, every school is set up differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3461.791s">[Teixeira]</a>: The Columbus has two separate areas where one group can go to one side, one can go to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3468.855s">[Teixeira]</a>: I know all of the buildings don't have that much space around them, but they're going to structure it where students can still play, but do it in a responsible manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3919.195s">[Teixeira]</a>: I just want to add, you know, we've spent the past couple months trying to look at how we can completely redesign schools in the middle of a pandemic and keep everybody safe and still provide a quality education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3931.642s">[Teixeira]</a>: There were some questions about teacher professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3934.9s">[Teixeira]</a>: We are offering professional development for teachers to make this adjustment because we're asking teachers to completely change the way they've taught, whether it's a hybrid model or remote model, this is something completely new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3947.648s">[Teixeira]</a>: Prior to getting the extra 10 days front loaded at the beginning of the year, we did opt to take that Tuesday election day and make that a PD day for teachers in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3960.096s">[Teixeira]</a>: They've been given a platform on a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3964.025s">[Teixeira]</a>: by a company called Better Lessons, which is specifically designed to support teachers with their instruction in a remote model, a hybrid model, and how they can make that curriculum accessible synchronously and asynchronously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3979.32s">[Teixeira]</a>: That contract with Better Lessons will go through, even though the training happens in August,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3985.308s">[Teixeira]</a>: they get to remain on as coaches, I think, through October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=3988.611s">[Teixeira]</a>: So teachers will still have access to that professional development once they're in the thick of trying to juggle this different style of teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4109.876s">[Teixeira]</a>: And also if I could just add with the better lessons professional development, that wasn't, it's not just for teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators are also participating in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4119.309s">[Teixeira]</a>: So as a district, everybody is on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4236.088s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we lost Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4244.871s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm not sure if everyone can hear me well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4276.892s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm not sure if Dr. Cushing is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4279.78s">[Teixeira]</a>: locked out or frozen, but we want to thank everybody who is on this panel for contributing your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4287.629s">[Teixeira]</a>: We will be taking the questions and putting them into a frequently asked questions and kind of compiling them from the two sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4294.237s">[Teixeira]</a>: It also gives us something to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4295.979s">[Teixeira]</a>: The school committee meeting is Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4300.442s">[Teixeira]</a>: you know, please come in attendance and share your views there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4304.904s">[Teixeira]</a>: We'll be taking all of this feedback to tweak the plans as they have been presented to the Department of Ed, and our final plan goes in, I believe, August 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n50NtLaAUqY&t=4314.107s">[Teixeira]</a>: Thank you very much for attending, and we look forward to continuing this work with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3535.351s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3538.612s">[Teixeira]</a>: through a partnership with UMass Boston's Applied Linguistics Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3544.714s">[Teixeira]</a>: They applied for a grant with the US Department of Education and we were supportive of that and talked about how we would use that grant for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3557.618s">[Teixeira]</a>: And what this would allow us to do is provide basically a free half of a master's degree<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3564.918s">[Teixeira]</a>: and applied linguistics for teachers and paraprofessionals who already possess like a bachelor's degree going into a master's program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3573.93s">[Teixeira]</a>: And what this would allow us to do is increase our capacity for not only<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3580.916s">[Teixeira]</a>: hiring teachers to work with English learners, but it would also give us the ability to have content teachers, not only be duly certified in their content in EL, but they would have all of the theory for second language acquisition as part of what they could bring to the classroom every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3602.146s">[Teixeira]</a>: We will be starting this program and this is the first that it's been publicized in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3607.953s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we'll be working to recruit teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3610.837s">[Teixeira]</a>: We have teachers and paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3613.701s">[Teixeira]</a>: We have 15 slots available and the classes would begin in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3618.647s">[Teixeira]</a>: These teachers would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3620.945s">[Teixeira]</a>: for to get their five core classes completed as part of their master's program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3627.609s">[Teixeira]</a>: And once they complete those five courses, they're eligible for ESL certification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3634.574s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then they can continue on in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3637.775s">[Teixeira]</a>: They can take advantage of Medford's tuition reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3641.438s">[Teixeira]</a>: It wouldn't cover the entire remaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3644.053s">[Teixeira]</a>: portion of the master's degree, but it would pay for a chunk of it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3649.238s">[Teixeira]</a>: This would be available to elementary, middle, and high school teachers looking to obtain this additional master's degree and certification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3660.709s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then with that, there's coaching that's embedded in this for family and community outreach,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3669.757s">[Teixeira]</a>: for providing professional development for other teachers in the buildings that they're currently working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3676.822s">[Teixeira]</a>: And they'll be doing that as a cohort throughout the process of their program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3683.886s">[Teixeira]</a>: Any questions on that part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3690.091s">[Teixeira]</a>: The second news, which I just added onto this is, as you know, we have a partnership with Lesley University for elementary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3698.826s">[Teixeira]</a>: elementary teachers or teacher seeking elementary certification, they go through a master's program to get their gen ed in grades one through six, they do a year long internship in the EL department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3713.456s">[Teixeira]</a>: in any elementary school, typically a newcomer's classroom, but sometimes that doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3718.999s">[Teixeira]</a>: And we do a balance of the gen ed classroom and EL pullout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3726.382s">[Teixeira]</a>: And Leslie is extending this program into middle and high school for secondary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3732.145s">[Teixeira]</a>: So teachers that are seeking to get their master's degree in math, the humanities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3740.67s">[Teixeira]</a>: can also do an add-on EL license if they do this year-long internship at the secondary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3747.295s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so Medford's also working with them to establish that and get some candidates in the district for that program as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3780.799s">[Teixeira]</a>: I don't, you know, and so that is an interesting question because there are other cohorts that will be, that will begin like in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3788.586s">[Teixeira]</a>: And, you know, I'll stay in touch if we can't, you know, if they don't, if other districts aren't filling them, you know, to see if we can jump in on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3796.954s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this happened because I was looking for interns to come do their student teaching in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3807.671s">[Teixeira]</a>: through meeting the director and going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3809.491s">[Teixeira]</a>: And I brought her down to the McGlynn Middle School to show her the program and program design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3815.173s">[Teixeira]</a>: And that's when she started talking about this opportunity that they were applying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3821.055s">[Teixeira]</a>: And I don't know what like years two, three and four looked like for them, but Medford would definitely be a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3833.514s">[Teixeira]</a>: So it's 15 people, 15 teachers and paraprofessionals for this January cohort, but they will have other cohorts throughout the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3847.338s">[Teixeira]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=203.798s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=204.879s">[Teixeira]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=230.484s">[Teixeira]</a>: I will be fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=235.667s">[Teixeira]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=236.828s">[Teixeira]</a>: So you guys got a pretty thick packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=238.909s">[Teixeira]</a>: We're not gonna go over the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=240.47s">[Teixeira]</a>: I sent you the ELE requirements because even though it just says like parent notification, there's like three pages of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=249.216s">[Teixeira]</a>: So I just wanted you to understand what the requirements are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=253.078s">[Teixeira]</a>: on everything that this review does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=257.139s">[Teixeira]</a>: So it occurs every six year with a three-year check-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=260.7s">[Teixeira]</a>: And for the past year, I've been working on this with DESE, uploading, they wanna know our procedures, they wanna see samples of all of the documentation that we send home to caregivers, our report cards, our progress reports, and then they pull individual student records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=279.468s">[Teixeira]</a>: And they look at, you know, they want to make sure if it's a student who's bilingual who has an IEP that there was an interpreter at their meeting and they, you know, want verification for the sign in sheets and all of this gets uploaded to Desi's portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=292.352s">[Teixeira]</a>: It was probably about 1000 pages of paperwork that they got in preparation for this review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=298.234s">[Teixeira]</a>: They do that every six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=299.736s">[Teixeira]</a>: They came to the district, they interviewed caregivers, students, teachers, administrators, and then they did walkthroughs through the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=309.791s">[Teixeira]</a>: So that's what the tiered focus monitoring is for the EL department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=317.105s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this is the criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=318.586s">[Teixeira]</a>: There are 12 different areas that they look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=321.467s">[Teixeira]</a>: Like I said, each area has subgroups and pretty involved compliance at the federal level and also at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=332.112s">[Teixeira]</a>: And this is the legal requirement and the implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=334.893s">[Teixeira]</a>: This was a sample just to show you what they look for for one criterion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=340.794s">[Teixeira]</a>: So upon their review, they give a rating system for each criterion, and then if it's implemented, the requirement's substantially met in all important aspects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=350.837s">[Teixeira]</a>: If it's partially implemented, the requirement in one or several of those aspects, like the subgroups, may not be met, and then not implemented is the requirement is substantially not met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=362.259s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we met or exceeded the state and federal implementation requirements in 10 out of 12 focus areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=372.096s">[Teixeira]</a>: we received partially implemented in two out of the 12 focus areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=376.338s">[Teixeira]</a>: So the two areas we had were ELE program placement and structure, which again, that's like three pages of requirements, and ELE 14, which is the licensure requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=389.142s">[Teixeira]</a>: The program and placement structure was a result of being under 50% for students making progress on the access test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=397.805s">[Teixeira]</a>: we are at 38%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=400.827s">[Teixeira]</a>: But I did pull the state data and surrounding districts just to show you we're all in the same boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=407.993s">[Teixeira]</a>: We just happen to have a curriculum, I mean, a coordinated program review or a tiered focus monitoring this year, but we are at 38%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=416.319s">[Teixeira]</a>: Now, I realize we don't wanna be in line with the state, we wanna be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=421.042s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we do have to do corrective action on how we're going to adjust that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=425.944s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=429.545s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this is a report that came out in November 23 about the rising numbers of unmet needs with immigrant newcomer students in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=439.248s">[Teixeira]</a>: So again, this isn't a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=441.229s">[Teixeira]</a>: It is a statewide issue, but we are taking steps to help course correct with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=450.768s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this is the action plan to get us out of corrective action for ELE 5, and I'm not going to go over it because you have it all in your packets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=460.599s">[Teixeira]</a>: This was submitted to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and they approved this plan as a feasible plan to make the adjustments that we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=471.331s">[Teixeira]</a>: There are a lot of things happening in the district that I do believe will contribute to increased scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=477.857s">[Teixeira]</a>: Everything from our new curriculum for early literacy, the science of reading that's happening in the schools, because our EL students are integrated in all of those classes, that will be a factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=491.668s">[Teixeira]</a>: in achievement and growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=493.789s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then we have the MAP growth, we have DIBLS testing, so we can do our formative assessments and check-ins throughout the year and adjust accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=503.574s">[Teixeira]</a>: ELE 14 was on licensure requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=506.475s">[Teixeira]</a>: This wasn't licensure for EL, this was a concern with Gen Ed classroom teachers not having the SEI endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=517.788s">[Teixeira]</a>: So this is a relatively easy fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=521.369s">[Teixeira]</a>: Because our numbers have grown dramatically in the last few years, there were many teachers who couldn't take the SEI class because they had to have EL students in their classroom in order to take that class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=534.256s">[Teixeira]</a>: That was one of the requirements when DESE was offering that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=538.365s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so if they never had an EL student in their class, they were never flagged with DESE as needing the endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=546.051s">[Teixeira]</a>: But as our numbers have grown and our EL students are in more and more classrooms, that's what triggered this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=552.916s">[Teixeira]</a>: And we think we have about 18 teachers who need the endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=559.22s">[Teixeira]</a>: We're working with principals to get an exact list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=563.263s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then in the fall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=564.844s">[Teixeira]</a>: We will work with the teachers to help them get the endorsement that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=568.646s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so by January of 2025, we should be all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=573.808s">[Teixeira]</a>: Any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=578.65s">[Teixeira]</a>: Have a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=323.364s">[Teixeira]</a>: Um, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=323.984s">[Teixeira]</a>: Hi, I'm Baltic Sarah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=325.064s">[Teixeira]</a>: I'm the director of the English learner education program for the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=381.657s">[Teixeira]</a>: Yes, we can see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1998.779s">[Teixeira]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1999.58s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we use the map data a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2002.661s">[Teixeira]</a>: We'll have all of our students, whether they're newcomers or Yale pullout students, they take the math map test because that's informing us, obviously,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2013.462s">[Teixeira]</a>: Fifth grade looks different in Brazil than it does in China, than it does in Haiti, than it does in the US.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2019.988s">[Teixeira]</a>: So because it is based on the standards, we can target what our students are missing, not due to lack of instruction here, but what they didn't get in their countries prior to coming in, because we place them by grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2033.879s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if they're in seventh grade and they missed fifth grade skills, we can hone in on that using the map data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2042.659s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then for the ELA map, only our pull-out students who are level 3-4 EL or higher will take the map ELA test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2053.902s">[Teixeira]</a>: And we use that data to make our placement decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2057.563s">[Teixeira]</a>: If they're ready to exit from the EL program, it's another piece of data in addition to the access test, if we can place them in mainstream classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2067.341s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then we also just, we use the science in a similar way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2071.946s">[Teixeira]</a>: MCAS is just fifth and eighth grade there, but it helps us kind of hone in on what skills that they may be missing because of cultural differences with educational systems in different countries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2103.672s">[Teixeira]</a>: Yeah, so we do have a separate ELD curriculum, English Language Development curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2109.495s">[Teixeira]</a>: And I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2110.776s">[Teixeira]</a>: I have a different list that I added, and I may have missed this, Suzanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2116.159s">[Teixeira]</a>: As you were going through it, I didn't add my stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2118.624s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we have English language development curriculum based on students' grade level and their English language proficiency level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2125.249s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so currently right now what's happening in the elementary, because we now have a new program into reading, the HMH program, our EL curriculum hasn't changed, but we're updating the curriculum to support the new materials being used to deliver that curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2618.393s">[Teixeira]</a>: Hi, good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2619.436s">[Teixeira]</a>: Dr. Cushy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2627.992s">[Teixeira]</a>: The EL Summer Enrichment Program, we have various programs that happen starting in the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2633.875s">[Teixeira]</a>: It starts with a one-week STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base through STAR Labs, which is a week-long STEM camp for students in fifth and sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2645.521s">[Teixeira]</a>: They do robotics, engineering, computer design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2649.723s">[Teixeira]</a>: They build rockets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2651.044s">[Teixeira]</a>: They get to launch them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2652.504s">[Teixeira]</a>: It's kind of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2654.365s">[Teixeira]</a>: and after that ends then we roll into our summer enrichment program which it's basically uh k through eight uh k through five is at the missatuck our numbers actually doubled this year we typically have about 45 students in the program during the summer and this year we had almost 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2676.325s">[Teixeira]</a>: Then at the middle school, which we host up at the high school, we run a middle school summer enrichment program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2681.647s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then we do an add-on program for credit recovery for high school students to get what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2688.79s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if they failed a class, it's a combination of enrichment and credit recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2697.188s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then we also offer tutoring at the Medford Public Library, and that's for our secondary students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2704.413s">[Teixeira]</a>: Teachers will do office hours, just one hour, and it fluctuates based on availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2710.637s">[Teixeira]</a>: It's mornings and evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2713.358s">[Teixeira]</a>: And students who need help with getting their summer reading done, picking out books, any other math or history packets at the secondary level, there's a teacher there to kind of guide them through that through the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2727.33s">[Teixeira]</a>: And those, Dr. Cushing, if you want, I just have pictures of what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2731.733s">[Teixeira]</a>: Also at the elementary program, we contracted with High Touch High Tech, which is a science organization that's in Massachusetts and Maine, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2744.882s">[Teixeira]</a>: And they come and we get to pick what they're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2748.464s">[Teixeira]</a>: I think last year was bridges, beams, and columns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2751.626s">[Teixeira]</a>: This year they did electricity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2754.067s">[Teixeira]</a>: They learned how to build circuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2756.369s">[Teixeira]</a>: And so the scientists come and they rotate through the grades throughout the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2763.273s">[Teixeira]</a>: Dr. Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2765.543s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then with the elementary program, because this is enrichment and it's paid for out of Title III, we try to plan a field trip every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2773.349s">[Teixeira]</a>: Because of our increased numbers, we actually had to separate out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2776.671s">[Teixeira]</a>: So all of the students got to go to the Franklin Park Zoo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2780.834s">[Teixeira]</a>: But the Children's Museum and the Aquarium, we divided it K-2 and 3-5 to offset the numbers because Title III will pay the admission, the transportation costs, everything for the students for the enrichment program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2796.926s">[Teixeira]</a>: Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2798.567s">[Teixeira]</a>: These are just various photos of the field trips that the students went on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2802.808s">[Teixeira]</a>: And the summer curriculum is tied into what the students are learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2806.27s">[Teixeira]</a>: So, you know, there's an animal component, there's sea life, there's, you know, general academics that also happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2813.613s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then these are photos from Starbase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2816.894s">[Teixeira]</a>: This was actually building bridges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2821.836s">[Teixeira]</a>: And this was CAD design for programming the robots too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2828.68s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then again, as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2830.381s">[Teixeira]</a>: Bowen said, this wouldn't have happened without the support of the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2833.883s">[Teixeira]</a>: This is the list of all of the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2837.025s">[Teixeira]</a>: I was also fully staffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2838.385s">[Teixeira]</a>: I was very lucky because of the increased numbers that I managed to get some additional staff to support the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2844.349s">[Teixeira]</a>: And then also a special thanks to Anthony Petralis because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2848.351s">[Teixeira]</a>: what we do is our program ends at noon but what we've done with him is arranged that we have 30 slots for the after-school program that they can go into summer fun i provide the teachers as an add-on so students can stay and get the full day in if they choose<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2880.592s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we took a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2882.292s">[Teixeira]</a>: So we send out a separate permission slip after students show up and register, and we keep a separate list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2887.853s">[Teixeira]</a>: So as students, not every student that signed up could go on to Summer Fun because we only have the 30 slots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2893.755s">[Teixeira]</a>: We can't overwhelm the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2895.715s">[Teixeira]</a>: but anyone that signed up for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2897.715s">[Teixeira]</a>: So if a student was absent, we could rotate through, we would call and say, oh, you know, child can stay today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2904.257s">[Teixeira]</a>: So almost everybody got, you know, that wanted to got to experience it at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2921.96s">[Teixeira]</a>: I wish I had an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2922.94s">[Teixeira]</a>: It was a surprise when the registration started coming in and we were counting up the numbers and making the class lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2929.663s">[Teixeira]</a>: I just, I don't have a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2935.405s">[Teixeira]</a>: Like I said, it gave me it because of the registration and we'll accept registrations the day of, because again, it's enrichment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2943.368s">[Teixeira]</a>: Again, it allowed us to give us a little lag time because we had that week off to recruit two more teachers for the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2953.336s">[Teixeira]</a>: Yes, it all comes out of the Title III grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2985.683s">[Teixeira]</a>: So like I said, they were building bridges, so I don't know if that's what that program would be for, but then the other program in the other picture was coding so they could actually program their robots to follow a track, and then the robots fight the little robot wars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3003.534s">[Teixeira]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3007.597s">[Teixeira]</a>: It was a little more than just one week.<br><br>
