 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CDjpOlSb3Do&t=5.667s">Hello</a> Medford residents, I'm Patrick Clerken, a candidate for one of seven seats on our City Council. <a

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=47.754s">Thanks</a> for having me back again, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=48.994s">It's</a> good to be back.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=82.057s">Yeah,</a> this does really seem to be the linchpin issue in the city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=86.701s">And</a> I think it's a really unfortunate that it's come to a grinding halt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=91.646s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=93.551s">I</a> first and foremost agree that there does need to be a comprehensive look at the city zoning, you don't just want it to be a patchwork or a Frankenstein's monster of different zoning proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=106.679s">But</a> I also think you have to offset that with considering the needs of the neighborhoods, and I've said that before, and I'll continue to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=113.804s">I</a> think that the biggest oversight was not doing neighborhood impact studies with the neighborhoods that were going to be affected so that you would understand things like traffic flow patterns and parking situation and the utilities, what the effect was going to be on as you connect these large buildings up to the utilities and <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=136.056s">the</a> sound studies that affect what are the different neighborhoods going to hear from the traffic changes, and also light studies, what are the shadow effects going to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=148.046s">And</a> because that wasn't done in a, I would say, sophisticated way that kept people abreast of what was going on, people felt like they were just being excluded from the process or that they were being railroaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=166.448s">So</a> here we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=168.49s">Things</a> have come to a grinding halt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=170.652s">And</a> I think that clearly the city's budget needs this commercial revenue and this mutual revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=178.118s">I</a> don't think it's a good idea to try to operate off of overrides and debt exclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=186.646s">I</a> think that is, as I've mentioned before, a form of financial duct tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=191.045s">But</a> if we're to do this properly and it's to be balanced, I think one of the steps that is really going to help us move in that direction is this new charter that's on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=200.873s">Some</a> people might not know about it, but basically what it does is it balances the city overall, the representation with word-based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=210.721s">Right</a> now, we have seven at-large city council candidates, and the proposal is that we would be moving to 11 overall candidates with three of them being at-large and eight of them being word-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=223.972s">That</a> really creates the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=226.034s">It</a> sets the stage for really what was missing, I feel, in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=231.117s">in</a> this rezoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=235.058s">We</a> have to really set the stage for neighborhood leadership and neighborhood participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=240.799s">I</a> think that charter that's on the ballot will be a huge step in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=245.801s">If</a> it is voted in, it doesn't take over immediately, but we have two years to lay the groundwork for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=256.723s">And</a> I think if we do that, then that sets the stage for other things, like the high school is another big thing that's on people's minds right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=264.807s">And</a> with the high school, it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=267.689s">Do</a> we lean towards strategic renovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=270.93s">Do</a> we lean towards an entirely new building? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=274.842s">And</a> whatever your feelings are on that, we have to learn from the mistakes that were made in the rezoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=281.766s">And</a> we have to properly include the residents throughout the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=285.969s">And</a> we have to say the pros and cons. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=288.35s">And</a> we have to not lean prickly on overrides and de-exclusions to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=294.314s">So</a> all of those things tie together in one big package.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=338.649s">Let's</a> get one quick tip.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=362.643s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=364.257s">I</a> do feel it's a good thing to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=365.679s">You</a> know, a couple years ago when I first ran, I was really not familiar with the charter process that was occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=372.306s">And</a> I was concerned that there was going to be ideology and partisanship baked into the cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=378.733s">But</a> after seeing what they did for the last two years, where it wasn't just <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=383.758s">the</a> public. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=384.358s">It</a> wasn't just a diverse team of 11 resident voices led by Melvin McDonald, who just ran for council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=393.561s">And</a> they consulted with people who have made many different charters across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=400.783s">So</a> I think that was an important piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=403.284s">But</a> I read the entire, I don't know, 35, 37 pages or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=408.586s">And</a> I was impressed by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=410.246s">And</a> it wasn't just <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=412.442s">that</a> it was the ward based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=414.503s">It</a> was also that we now have a regular charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=417.845s">The</a> last time we had that was 40 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=420.467s">We</a> now have a budget meeting that's mandatory between the mayor and the city council and the school committee that has to happen annually earlier in the year so that the budget doesn't get kicked down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=431.353s">So</a> there's a bunch of things that I like about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=433.594s">And</a> I encourage people to look at it in total rather than just some little piece of it.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=470.635s">And-</a> Thank you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=471.675s">And</a> thank you for the Medford Happenings team for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Nu2-4z_hmI&t=474.776s">It's</a> really sorely needed.<h2><a href="../2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI/2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI.html">City Council 09-30-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=140.97s">So</a> this isn't a brilliant answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=143.412s">It's</a> a simple answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=144.492s">It's</a> just something that we have to get right, which is getting people the information that they need in as simple as terms and as compelling of terms as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=153.498s">So</a> that means the way that I see it, showing them a map of this is what the city looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=158.681s">This</a> is what we're proposing, highlighting the areas of where we're planning to <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=163.264s">put</a> additional housing, and then saying, this is how it affects your life, and this is why these areas are optimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=171.466s">We've</a> looked at other areas, and I think it's really important to justify to people that we didn't just pick these areas out of a hat, or we didn't pick these areas because someone in government or in the periphery of government had some connection to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=185.928s">It's</a> really well thought out, and I think that if we <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=191.011s">There's</a> this paradox that exists of if you want to get this better information out to people, but you Already can't get it out to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=197.996s">How</a> do you how do you let them know about it to begin with? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=201.819s">And</a> I think that really communicating with Through this channel through Medford happenings and also got to know Medford are two big Opportunities that we have right now to really get it out to people.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=233.516s">Yes,</a> I think that we need to find the influencers within Medford, the people within different districts, the people within certain knowledge categories, because they're not always the people in the titled positions, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=249.246s">This</a> is something that I was thinking about previously when I was working on a media project a couple years ago called the Medford Community Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=256.777s">We</a> were trying to basically think, how do you identify these key stakeholders who are very knowledgeable? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=262.865s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=264.567s">If</a> you put the word out, once again, I'm probably going to repeat this a lot, through these new channels, through this one, through God I Know Medford, hey, All Point Bulletin, we're looking for people, if you know a lot about this, if you care a lot about this, we need you to be the representative <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=281.687s">so</a> to speak, for your area of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=284.808s">And</a> when it comes to holding them to that, I think we have to set a regular meeting among those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=292.589s">And</a> I don't know, there needs to be a leader of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=295.63s">So</a> I don't know if the leader is going to be chosen among them or exactly how that would look, but yeah.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=319.32s">Yeah,</a> and I think that people who are more casually, people who want to be more civically involved in the city are dissuaded because of the just general tenor intention of politics right now, where they're observing, whether you realize it or not, they're observing other people who are putting themselves out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=337.989s">And</a> when those people get piled on, they go, okay, no thanks.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=343.039s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=365.947s">On</a> the public side of it, I think that if we put together a, when I say we, I have to decide exactly, think more about exactly who the we is, but putting together a coherent proposal, couple of pages that could be handed over to housing and urban development at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=386.043s">Like</a> if we're trying to get state funds for something like this, we have to, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=391.007s">We</a> have to, I think, show that we want to work with Massachusetts, but we're not going to get bullied and pushed around for state-level needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=399.89s">Because</a> one of the questions that exists right now is, OK, yes, there's some grant money out there, but what are the strings attached to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=408.254s">And</a> I have an announcement coming over the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=412.615s">Give</a> me one second.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=418.414s">You</a> can't hear it on that end. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=419.275s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=421.878s">So,</a> so basically, you know, the question is what strings are attached to the, to the grant money and I think that a lot of people feel that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=432.731s">sometimes</a> the things that are being pushed in Medford, is it really in Medford's best interest or is it the best interest of other entities like the Massachusetts government? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=440.714s">So</a> I think if we sort of meet them at the table with our counter-proposal, then that's a step in the right direction for public funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=448.557s">When</a> it comes to private funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=450.818s">I</a> think maybe working with the business community in Medford, partly the Chamber of Commerce, partly other maybe individual business entities, and Bruce Patterson, my campaign manager, actually introduced me to something that worked in Chinatown, where they wanted to put in <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=470.387s">some</a> businesses and then there was the local said, well, if you're gonna put in these businesses, you're gonna put in this housing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=476.128s">And</a> then there was pushback and then they said, no, we mean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=478.709s">And</a> then the businesses acquiesced and there was funding for the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=482.97s">So</a> those are two leverage points, I think.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=526.368s">Well,</a> a while back, probably a month and a half ago, I read through the entire document and I'm a big fan of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=533.855s">I</a> think that they did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=535.757s">When</a> I previously ran, I wasn't as familiar with their work and I was a little bit concerned, okay, how is this being done? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=542.743s">Is</a> there gonna be politics baked into it? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=545.726s">But</a> it's a really, I think it's a significant leg up on our current charter and I don't see any, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=553.332s">you</a> know, politics baked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=555.473s">So</a> I think they did a really good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=556.813s">Particularly,</a> I'm a huge fan of the word-based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=561.395s">There's</a> two other aspects as well that I really like.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=574.387s">As</a> a whole, I certainly believe it will help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=576.889s">I</a> would definitely encourage people to vote in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=580.731s">And</a> I'm actually going to make a little video about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=582.653s">But</a> the word based representation is a huge step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=586.996s">When</a> I was talking about the answer to your previous question, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=590.702s">Right</a> about kind of community liaisons in these different areas.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=596.008s">Should</a> the charter pass in November, there's going to be a period of 2 years before it goes into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=602.975s">And</a> so I think that ultimately having this word based representation is going to be a huge step in the right direction for making sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=610.483s">broadly</a> every area of the city is represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=613.164s">The</a> second thing that I really like is that built into the charter is a review every 10 years, which I think is absolutely necessary so that this current situation doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=624.886s">And</a> then the third thing is it forces, there's wording in the charter that forces the mayor and the city council to address budget much earlier in the year rather than waiting until the June deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=637.909s">They</a> have to address it earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=640.51s">We</a> need that in my opinion.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=662.886s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=663.367s">There's</a> a, you know, there's a amendment process that's laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=667.588s">It's</a> just like with the constitution, you wouldn't want a document that is so easy to change that anyone could just get all the time, but you want to have a built in adjustment process that adapts to the times.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=712.497s">Well,</a> I'd really like to focus on commercial revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=715.058s">I</a> don't think I'm saying anything new there, but I do think that we need to get the zoning process right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=721.519s">We've</a> been focused on residential with the zoning, but the commercial aspect of it, I think we have to create incentive packages for businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=730.822s">Talking</a> to somebody recently, I have a weekly Colleen's event every Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=735.644s">And</a> there was a gentleman who was talking to me, he's a contractor and he's done work in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=742.887s">And</a> he says, Medford and Malden are night and day when it comes to the ease of getting stuff done. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=747.529s">And</a> I asked him more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=748.649s">And</a> he just said that they basically just create a package for you where they say, this is what you need, these five things or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=755.712s">And</a> once you get that done, it's a breeze. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=758.773s">once</a> the contractors get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=760.275s">So</a> I think that not only making it clear what people have to do, and this is across basically everything in our government, we just have to have clearer processes for people because I really feel like we don't have some of this stuff written down and we're just going on the fly a lot of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=776.734s">And</a> if that's not the case, then where are the processes, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=780.998s">So</a> I think we have to be clear with our processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=783.06s">The</a> second thing for the businesses is just create a better package of incentives that draw them in, like maybe quicker utilities hookups for their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=793.168s">maybe</a> having a storefront, what do I want to call this, like a storefront beautification grant or something like that, maybe having expedited permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=805.531s">There's</a> a lot of options that you could bundle together and make it enticing to be commercially vested in Medford.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=819.578s">More</a> inviting to business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=820.598s">And</a> we get more tax base off of business.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=831.163s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=833.084s">You're</a> gonna notice this is essentially a common answer or a common factor across a lot of money.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=869.214s">It's</a> a little bit of a black box to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=871.675s">So</a> I'm digging into this myself right now to get a better sense of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=878.269s">I</a> do think that the what I previously mentioned with the charter is a big step in the right direction where it forces management earlier in the year and in a more transparent and simple manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=891.575s">Probably,</a> you know, I don't know that our city has that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=895.757s">We</a> have a very strained budget, but we probably need a second <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=900.2s">paid</a> person somewhere to to address it and I know that putting out money for anything is seen as really during these lean times is seen as really drastic or is that really necessary but that this is something that is an absolutely critical area that you know it would it would ease up tension in all these other areas the way that I see it.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=932.088s">And</a> I'll add that I think that possibly, I just said this the other day, I was doing an interview with the Tufts Daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=939.228s">I</a> think that, and people might get squeamish about this, but I think that the relationships between Tufts and Medford and Medford and the Chevalier need to be revisited, not in a way that scares away Tufts or the Chevalier, because they're wonderful assets to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=955.59s">But,</a> you know, with Tufts, for example, there's the pilot program and there's these town and gown services that Medford receives in place of taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=965.238s">And</a> maybe it can't be monetary, the compensation, but maybe the compensation or the arrangement between Tufts and Medford, who have both grown significantly since the original arrangement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=978.878s">negotiated</a> where attention and these in-kind resources get shifted from one area to another area that's really, really within the city's needs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=989.707s">And</a> I think that there's potential exciting room for negotiation there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=995.211s">And</a> then same with Chevalier, where Chevalier has a big network. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=998.534s">And</a> if we can work with the Chamber of Commerce and with Tufts to, or I'm sorry, with the Chevalier to tap into that network and say, hey, how can we <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1009.492s">you</a> know, use you to maybe optimize the Medford Square development process or something like that.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1076.551s">So</a> I won't bury the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1078.433s">I</a> view overrides in general as financial duct tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1082.778s">And</a> I. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1086.065s">I</a> support the underlying initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1088.106s">I</a> do think there needs to be a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1090.028s">And</a> I know we're well on the way with the proposal and the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1093.59s">So</a> I suppose I support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1095.751s">And</a> I remember seeing that the sanitation and the fire station was quite a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1102.395s">And</a> just in general, it's been a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1106.538s">The</a> fire tower was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1107.999s">There</a> was nothing put back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1109.34s">The</a> police got a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1110.741s">It's</a> time, I believe, for the firemen to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1114.643s">The</a> underlying project I support when it comes to the high school I lean towards Renovation, I don't think that it's in our capacity being these lean times right now To support a full high school as much as it would be great to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1130.994s">I</a> previously mentioned based on Rick Orlando's Previous interview on this show back in the 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1138.118s">We</a> got a huge reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1139.859s">We</a> really wouldn't get anywhere near that these days so <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1143.161s">But</a> I would like to see the range of options. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1145.883s">I</a> would like to see the best case proposal for a complete do-over for a completely new school, for strategic renovations, and then basically for doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1159.094s">And</a> I'd like to compare them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1160.575s">So</a> back to the override aspect, I do think that when it comes to overrides, I would like to see the case laid out for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1169.616s">why</a> the override is the only option, if that really is the only option. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1173.32s">I'm</a> not saying there aren't cases that an override might be effectively the only option, but you really have to lay out that case. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1180.789s">When</a> it comes to city finances, you either tackle the revenue side or the expenses side or both. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1186.235s">And</a> with revenues, you pretty much have commercial revenues and that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1190.8s">up</a> and in zoning you have bonds that you can issue and you have tax overrides primarily and and then you have grants and with the with the recent grant cuts you know at the federal level and in the state level you know rippling down <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1205.644s">If</a> you're going to make the case that an override is necessary, I want to see complementary efforts in the other areas to either increase the revenues or decrease the expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1216.273s">I</a> want to see what else you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1218.074s">Because</a> what you're doing with overrides is you're basically targeting a specific group that is highly vested and really can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1226.661s">You're</a> basically just, I've said it before, you're basically like a towel squeezing equity out of people's.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1235.308s">So</a> I really want to see the public case made, if someone's going to be advocating for an override, that other things are being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1245.658s">And</a> even then, I would be very hesitant to support overrides.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1298.322s">You</a> just go, the rest, you know, is fake.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1360.435s">Sure,</a> so a couple come to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1363.678s">And</a> this is the one that always is at the tip of everyone's tongue, is the state of the streets in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1369.742s">And</a> I think that's partly, once again, an aspect of getting the current plans out there to people so that they can actually see. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1377.488s">Because</a> some people think that there's actually nothing being done at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1381.712s">And</a> I stumbled upon, months ago, when I scoured the city website, there's actually a city-wide heat map of all of the streets that <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1390.551s">that</a> indicate by degree of severity the prioritization of the different streets when it comes to getting them fixed, and the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1398.275s">So</a> I think even just putting that out there, it's one of those situations where a lot of people, in the absence of information, they tend to grow more irritated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1407.019s">So</a> that allays some people's, right there, that allays, okay, at least there's a plan, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1412.262s">And</a> then the second part of that is getting the finances and the communications right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1416.064s">So</a> that ties into the other, you know, getting the communication simple, getting the finances tied to other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1422.408s">So</a> I digress on that particular topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1426.09s">The</a> other areas to me are <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1429.795s">Arts</a> and culture, I think that there's a consolidation, or I know that there's a consolidation happening right now in the arts and culture space. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1436.483s">I</a> think that's actually a very good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1438.445s">Because</a> arts and culture is more decentralized by nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1443.23s">It's</a> sort of the seedbed of creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1446.915s">You</a> don't want it to be too top-down controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1449.177s">but</a> it's actually good that some of these entities are coming together and they can coordinate resources and projects better. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1454.699s">I</a> would love to see the arts and culture community tied into more civic projects that are put into murals that are more relevant to Medford and Medford history, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1466.822s">Yeah,</a> phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1468.484s">And</a> that's not, you know, Medford has a rich history. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1470.906s">It</a> has Italian and Irish and Jewish and black. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1474.149s">And</a> now we have Brazilian and we have, you know, Tufts area hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1477.753s">And</a> there's just so many you could have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1479.735s">I</a> think that would be a huge part of of neighborhood integration and neighborhood identity is sort of and I'm hoping that can be tied into the. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1489.805s">you</a> the new charter if it passes and charter represent word based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1494.61s">And</a> then the third thing is I would love to see better relations with, um, with public safety officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1503.158s">And</a> I think that the national night out was a huge step in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1507.282s">I</a> was I was actually just talking with <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1511.866s">in</a> tandem with the public safety officers, with veterans as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1515.087s">I</a> was just at a veterans meeting this morning at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1518.668s">And</a> one of the things that's up for conversation is the American Legion, the future of the American Legion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1523.849s">Could</a> it be a separate, could the veterans affairs office in the city hall be in a separate building? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1529.85s">And</a> could it be actually at the American Legion? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1531.991s">And</a> could that be a hub of other things as well, like a community food bank and offices related to other things, a bulletin? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1541.413s">So</a> I think that that would be, this is less urgent than some of the other matters.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1593.982s">Well,</a> six week, five week sprint, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1597.566s">That's</a> what's going on and probably diminished sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1600.83s">But</a> I am in the midst of revamping my website right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1606.917s">I</a> requested from people all over my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1611.282s">Going</a> back a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1612.764s">I'm</a> talking I requested testimonials from them basically character references saying you know me from from some aspect Maybe you were a roommate. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1621.613s">Maybe</a> you were a client. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1622.895s">Maybe</a> you were a manager, but I have a like 45 testimonials that I'm gonna be posting out saying hey <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1631.224s">Because</a> you can hear it from me, but I can you know, I can say hearing it from others really matters So that's that's coming out got a fundraiser coming up on October 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1640.976s">That's</a> gonna be at Bertucci's I should I should clarify that once I confirm with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1646.323s">It's</a> going to be a British <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1651.61s">Yes,</a> and outside of that, you're just going to see me everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1656.977s">You're</a> going to see me at events. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1658.038s">You're</a> going to see me canvassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1659.62s">I'm</a> getting really strategic with, okay, where did I miss at the preliminary? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1663.686s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1664.126s">Cuz</a> cuz general generally before the preliminary throughout the last three or four months I was just trying to hit broadly everywhere in the city I was going to registered voters, but now I have to be very specific as you know trying to shore up my my support So that's that's basically what's going on with me and where you'll find me everywhere and when it comes to contacting me <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1689.653s">My</a> email is clerkin4medford at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1695.815s">My</a> website is clerkin4medford.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1700.076s">And</a> then you can also contact me on my social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1704.177s">I'm</a> on Instagram and Facebook, both of which are clerkin4medford, whether it's the number four or the word F-O-R. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCgO7RGIkoU&t=1712.559s">You'll</a> find me.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=398.56s">Hi</a> everyone, I'm Patrick Clerkin, and I'm gonna start off with a little bit of my backstory, and then I'm going to get into why it's relevant and what I'd like to do for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=407.565s">So</a> I'm a mechanical engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=409.246s">I've</a> worked in both a corporate context as an employee and as a contractor, and I've also been an entrepreneur, and most recently I've worked as a handyman. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=420.713s">And</a> with the handyman work, it's been a lot of meeting neighbors, getting out there, and a lot of practical hands-on stuff, so it's kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=427.973s">combining</a> the street smarts and the book smarts and the abstract and the physical hands-on stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=435.178s">So,</a> I have also been involved with a lot of different civic organizations, both as a member and as a leader within those organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=445.024s">Some</a> of them have been Habitat for Humanity, <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=447.427s">Big</a> Brother Big Sister, American Red Cross, and the board of my fraternity. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=452.748s">So</a> I want to bring all of those perspectives and experiences to my efforts here in Medford for the city's benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=460.19s">And</a> what I wanted to focus on in particular was robust community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=465.291s">And</a> how I see it, community is both communications and unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=469.787s">And</a> in 2023, when I ran for the first time, what I saw was that this city has so many resources and there's no hub of communications anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=479.293s">There</a> used to be a paper, there isn't anymore, there's some new things, but basically there's not a dashboard or there's not a consistent reference that people are consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=488.078s">And</a> when you don't have that, it causes anger and fear and distrust and confusion to proliferate. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=494.852s">And</a> so I have a bunch of different ideas as to how to practically address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=499.235s">They're</a> on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=500.036s">I</a> can't get into all of them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=501.697s">So</a> I recommend that you consult my website for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=504.92s">But</a> I will say, if you want a practical example as to how lack of communications negatively affects the city, look at the current zoning issue, how a lot of the people feel that this information has been dropped on them at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=517.489s">They</a> feel like things have already been decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=519.77s">they</a> feel like basically the neighborhoods aren't getting a say in this citywide process. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=526.793s">The</a> other aspect of what I wanted to focus on was unity, and I'm already embodying that democracy within my campaign where I've gone to all 16, canvassed all 16 precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=539.658s">I've</a> crossed demographic, geographic, partisan, ideological lines, talked to anyone, I don't care what, <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=546.227s">what</a> flag you have in your yard, what letter you have next to your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=548.809s">I</a> want everyone to be involved in this process, and I am actively doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=553.992s">So</a> the last thing that I'll say is that I'm focused on independent thinking, on practical solutions, on Medford in its entirety, and on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=566.701s">So</a> I would be a Councilor at large for Medford, not for Massachusetts, not for the United States, not for the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=573.586s">So</a> if these are values that you appreciate, <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=576.678s">please</a> vote for me on September 16th and on November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=580.442s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council 08-05-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=96.912s">So</a> I've been in Medford for nine years now, coming up in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=101.475s">And</a> before that, I grew up in North Reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=103.696s">I've</a> been a North Shore guy my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=105.957s">And</a> I went to North Reading Public School. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=109.479s">And</a> when I was in school, my favorite subjects were actually history, geography, and literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=115.843s">So</a> what does somebody whose favorite subjects are those do after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=120.106s">They</a> go to school for engineering, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=123.789s">I</a> went to Northeastern for mechanical engineering and it was it was partly <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=131.253s">My</a> high school had a couple programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=132.654s">It</a> was not like the Medford High School with these great vocational programs, but it had an architecture program or a class, I should say, an engineering class, and those sort of stoked my curiosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=143.359s">So</a> when I went to Northeastern Mechanical Engineering, did a couple co-ops there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=147.761s">If</a> you're familiar, they have this, you do classes one semester, jobs another semester. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=153.123s">That</a> was great because that was work experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=155.824s">And</a> I also got involved with a fraternity when I was there and was eventually the president of the fraternity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=162.268s">So</a> that's my entry point into leadership roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=165.77s">And</a> really post-college, I started working for a company in the semiconductor test industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=173.774s">Nothing</a> that you or I would ever work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=175.575s">It's</a> really company to company stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=178.396s">And</a> I was there for a couple years and I just kind of decided, you know, corporate was not really like I was too restless for corporate. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=186.408s">And</a> so I ventured out on my own and I really got involved with <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=193.358s">At</a> one point, I was doing my own entrepreneurial pursuit called Tether, and that was in the realm of communications and software. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=201.924s">And</a> then I also started making money through doing handyman work, which I really enjoyed because that was more practical, hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=211.191s">It</a> was very face-to-face with clients, and I got to know a lot of my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=215.334s">So</a> I'll say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=217.075s">Those</a> were sort of my entry points into, because people look at why you're involved in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=225.26s">Engineering</a> is sort of this profession that allows you to look deeply at problems from a systemic level and to look at the limitations of systems and to look at the possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=237.207s">So</a> it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=238.147s">It's</a> a combination of having gotten to know my neighbors through the handyman work. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=242.129s">And</a> I would say it's also the desire to be civically involved and an intermediary between people. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=249.473s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=264.097s">Yeah,</a> so I mentioned before that I started doing handyman work. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=268.3s">And</a> at one point, one of my neighbors said, oh, I really wish that we had better options for city council and that people were better addressing these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=278.687s">So</a> I looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=279.408s">That</a> was 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=280.909s">And</a> I really jumped in at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=282.93s">This</a> was like a week before the you have to get signatures to get your name on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=287.013s">It</a> was like a week before the signature deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=289.415s">So</a> when I say I was running for council, it was more like I was sprinting for council because it was such an immersive and quick process. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=298.46s">But</a> what I learned from last time, I didn't win last time, but what I learned was that one of the biggest issues that affects the city, that affects all of the problems that people see, is the communications issue that's citywide and it's gotten <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=315.87s">particularly</a> bad over the last five or six years with the lack of a common hub of information, like a city paper or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=324.519s">And</a> so now we have some of these new sources, like we've got Medford Happenings, we've got Gotta Know Medford, we've got some things that have filled that void. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=331.787s">But</a> after I ran last time, I really got this <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=336.192s">civically</a> oriented group of people together who really all saw the communications as a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=341.776s">And</a> we were meeting every week at the library, pretty much from New Year's to Memorial Day, trying to set something up. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=347.621s">And</a> what we came up with was called the Medford Community Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=350.883s">And</a> it kind of got shelved, but we got pretty far with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=355.447s">And</a> that's the foundation that I'm building upon this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=359.029s">I</a> have some ideas around improving the communications throughout the city.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=395.388s">Well,</a> so there's kind of two things that need to, two realms of problem that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=402.41s">One</a> of them is infrastructure, and one of them is more cultural in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=405.992s">And</a> so from the infrastructural side of things, I'm really focusing, first of all, on citywide issues and local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=413.214s">But</a> the ones that I've put on the back of my literature are the city budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=418.976s">The</a> development, both commercial and residential, zoning is a big, big topic right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=425.342s">The</a> high school, what to do with that, whether it's going to be a new high school, whether it's going to be doing renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=434.452s">And</a> then the fire station is another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=436.994s">And</a> I think that was pretty much it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=441.178s">One</a> of the biggest things that I've noticed is lacking is it's unclear what the processes are for these things, or if there are processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=450.005s">And</a> I'm not putting that on any given person, but coming from that engineering perspective that I mentioned before, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=457.436s">What</a> I would be looking for is some kind of a flow chart that says, OK, this is the first stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=462.262s">This</a> is the second stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=463.743s">Does</a> it pass this stage? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=464.965s">Yes</a> or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=465.705s">If</a> it's a yes, it goes in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=467.528s">If</a> it's a no, it goes in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=469.169s">And</a> it says the different departments that are involved, the different stakeholders that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=474.796s">And</a> it really gives... <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=476.297s">It</a> would really add to the transparency and accountability that you often hear politicians talk about, which often unfortunately falls through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=486.924s">So</a> I think that there's ways to do that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=491.987s">fiddled</a> around, people talk a lot about AI these days, and I'm not really on the doom train. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=498.152s">I'm</a> not really on the hype train. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=499.653s">I</a> try to walk the middle path. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=501.675s">But</a> I was fiddling around with chat GPT and just asking it some questions like, you know, hey, generate for me a sample of a of a flowchart depicting a municipal Department of Public Works filling in cracks and holes in city streets, you know, what that would look like, or <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=521.13s">Or</a> show me what a typical budgeting process would look like for a city of 65,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=526.652s">And</a> it's a little bit wonky. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=529.372s">It'll</a> spit out something with typos. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=531.993s">But</a> generally, it's pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=534.674s">It's</a> impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=535.554s">And</a> I think that those could be models for what we could build in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=542.236s">That's</a> one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=543.016s">There's</a> others, but yeah.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=606.632s">Yes,</a> yes, and yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=607.954s">I</a> hear that problem all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=609.556s">I</a> mean, that's probably the biggest problem that I hear, and I do think it can be addressed and it can be solved, but it's not an easy snap your fingers fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=621.554s">Yeah,</a> the zoning thing right now that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=624.495s">I</a> would say that thankfully, I just saw the other day, the mayor is releasing a letter saying, hey, I think we should move the decision for this process to the fall because a lot of the public is feeling caught off guard or uninformed about this, and I think that's very much the right choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=644.199s">Let's</a> take the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=645.501s">A</a> lot of people feel like this information is being dropped out of the void at the last minute and that the public comment period has passed and that there are these sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=660.39s">uh,</a> in sincere efforts to get public opinion, like the, these, uh, cardboard cutout attempts to, to, hey, we're, we're listening to the public, but are you really listening to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=671.833s">And</a> so, um, once again, I'm not trying to, to put that on, on any given, you know, person. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=678.255s">Uh,</a> in some cases I do think it's deliberate where, you know, the, the process has already gotten to a certain point and all the consultants have gotten involved and, and it's just about done and it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=689.999s">Like</a> we don't want to get the public to shut this down at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=693.626s">So</a> let's kind of you know Pass it through the through the later hours of the night or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=699.297s">But</a> then I think other times there's <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=702.702s">there</a> really is information that's posted out there, but it's posted in one of the drawers of the bureau in the city website, and who is ever going to find that?
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=713.713s">It</a> doesn't come out of the drawer, and so a couple weeks ago I really scoured the city website, and I'll be the first to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=721.821s">The</a> new city website is actually, it has some problems, but it's much better than what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=727.365s">And</a> there's a lot of great stuff on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=728.986s">There's</a> maps of the city that show these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=731.447s">There's</a> all these different project proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=735.31s">But</a> if you don't know that they're there, like what good are they to some extent? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=740.033s">And</a> so so that's why I think that there needs to be a bunch of people in the city the council included Working together to to address that to work with this, you know, you've interviewed gotta know Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=752.917s">They</a> could be a new they could fill that void. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=755.258s">Yeah,</a> and and I think that the city <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=759.299s">On</a> the front page of the city website, there currently is a section that shows the quick links for city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=770.405s">And</a> then beneath that, there's news and events. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=773.266s">But</a> I think there needs to be either a link or a little bulletin board that shows all of the currently ongoing city projects and links to key maps and key project developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=785.592s">I</a> think that would go a long way as well.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=824.615s">Yeah,</a> I think it was the right choice.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=856.157s">Yeah,</a> I mean I don't think that the immediate, and things have gotten bad enough where to some extent people might feel that this is the only option that they have, but I don't feel like the answer is just to squeeze the life out of the homeowners, you know, and wrench money out of their equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=873.578s">You</a> know, it's not to say like taxes are a necessary evil, but I think if it's part of a bigger package and a wider lens view of how to balance the city budget, I do need to familiarize myself more with the the details of the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=888.129s">But</a> broadly, I think we need to focus on seriously <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=893.152s">increasing</a> and diversifying the commercial and industrial tax base, and you don't do that in the residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=899.738s">The</a> residential component of development is a separate issue, but you do it on the Mystic Ave corridor, you do it partly in the Wellington area, in East Medford, you do it in places that are already really <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=913.951s">you</a> know, zoned for and have significant commercial and industrial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=919.798s">I</a> think it's a damn shame that in the city, and this isn't just someone who's deeply at this point, I consider myself pretty aware of what's going on, but I've heard these comments from people who <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=930.169s">really</a> are just casually observing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=931.97s">They</a> go for walks with their dogs, they take notes of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=934.65s">But</a> some of these boarded up shops and stretches of boarded up windows, I have a friend who lives over near the royal house and we used to take my dog for a walk and it can't even be real. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=946.373s">There's</a> a sausage casing business and it's just been shut forever and there's a whole strip of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=953.016s">And</a> you see a lot of those types of things throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=956.079s">So</a> I think that the city can create certain incentives, like maybe expedited permitting processes could be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=964.947s">Maybe</a> the utilities are a mess, in the sense of particularly the streets, making streets in front of businesses more attractive.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=980.859s">And</a> there's other financial arrangements that can be made.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1013.321s">One</a> last thing is I do think that it doesn't have to be an either or thing of you have to wholly satisfy the homeowners or wholly satisfy the renters or wholly satisfy the landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1026.027s">It's</a> something that if it's done wisely, it can balance all of those forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1032.411s">Because</a> Medford at the end of the day is an ecosystem and you need all those groups.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1072.343s">Yeah</a> well It would be nice if there if there was an audit but that is there's been some resistance to that and When it comes to priorities in the city for for spending I would say <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1091.715s">putting</a> a significant amount of that money into projects that are already underway, like the fire station is a big one that was already promised to the firemen and the fire tower when the new police station was put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1112.128s">And</a> there's a plan for that on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1114.87s">So</a> seeing that through is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1118.916s">looking</a> seriously at how far we can stretch the money that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1124.719s">I</a> do think that, you know, Rick Orlando was on in one of your episodes and he was talking about the process of building schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1131.463s">The</a> school is one of these looming things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1133.284s">What</a> do we do with the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1134.565s">Do</a> we renovate it? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1135.346s">Do</a> we do it over again? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1136.726s">Well,</a> Rick talked about how if we're <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1139.628s">you</a> know, if we were even to consider redoing the school all over again, we're not going to get the same, you know, abatements as previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1147.39s">You</a> know, there was that racial balancing that paid for, you know, like 90% of the schools or 75% of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1153.572s">So</a> I think we should prioritize the school because this school does have this studio that we're in right now is a gem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1161.394s">There's</a> the robotics club that's a gem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1164.255s">This</a> school has, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1166.976s">I'm</a> blanking on the name right now, Bistro 489. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1170.118s">There's</a> some really great stuff at this school, both vocational and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1174.641s">But</a> maybe we could look at it, how do we stretch our dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1180.504s">Some</a> people say, absolutely no way, never renovation, redo the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1184.187s">Well,</a> first of all, we're not going to get those refunds that we previously did. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1188.469s">Second</a> of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1189.69s">There's</a> good bones in this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1190.991s">There's</a> a lot of, I mean, it's a brutalist architectural style like the Boston City Hall, but maybe efforts could be done to make it more, you know, coming into the school to feel less sort of ominous, I would say.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1207.223s">And</a> to just renovate parts of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1209.825s">It</a> was built for a certain number of students that it currently is not filling, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1216.969s">I've</a> taken a tour of the whole school, so that is a goal of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1220.691s">I</a> have a neighbor down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1224.132s">a</a> couple, and they just moved here a couple years ago, and they're saying that they're already considering moving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1229.714s">Like,</a> they have a baby, they have another one on the way, and they're like, the school system, we just, you know, whether it's true or not, perception is reality to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1237.816s">And</a> they say, you know, we're moving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1239.737s">And</a> I think they're not alone with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1241.137s">There's</a> people who look at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1242.418s">So</a> I would consider that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1244.198s">A</a> hemorrhage within Medford is the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1248.162s">And</a> outside of that, I would just say, yeah, the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1253.266s">The</a> streets are a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1254.887s">And</a> putting forward on the city website, there's a plan for all the streets, prioritizing them by area. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1262.453s">Really</a> putting that forward and putting that next to that process flowchart that I was describing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1268.919s">So</a> people can see and hold the city accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1271.521s">Those</a> are the big ones.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1315.858s">see</a> it from two angles one is the on the streets level which is the meat and potatoes of like what is what is the average resident of Medford see and they see bad quality streets they see and unfortunately the bad things tend to stick out more than the good things and the things that are working you know you don't you know and when you're paying attention to things you don't go oh that's working really well you go oh that's a mess <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1337.547s">So</a> it's really unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1338.73s">But</a> people tend to lock into the things that aren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1341.415s">So</a> the state of the streets, the fact that we have a bunch of business sections that are <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1349.712s">more</a> worn down or mismatched or, uh, you know, not really diversified in the sense of, you know, not to, not to demean banks and credit unions and barbershops, but we have a lot as I walk around, we have a lot of both, both of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1363.342s">So,</a> um, a, a focus on the, what people actually see on the front end and then simultaneously on the back end, there's all these, these, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1373.911s">these</a> processes and communications failures that are happening that would make addressing the front end more possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1382.25s">And</a> I'll say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1384.283s">this</a> is both meat and potatoes and back end but I mentioned before how there's an infrastructural part of this and then there's also a cultural part just getting people to talk to each other again and not see each other as villains you know it's it's really like the number of people that have just disengaged has left the the smaller public square open to to be taken over by <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1410.433s">Brats</a> and bullies I would say And there's a lot of people who do participate who really just want to see things work and they're trying to get things work get things to work, but you know, there's there's also a lot of rancor and a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1428.502s">stuff</a> that sucks the oxygen out of the room, you know, and I do, I want to see neighbors talking to neighbors again and seeing each other as such, rather than like, you're a red, you're a blue, you're this, you're that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1442.226s">It's</a> not helping. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1442.966s">And</a> so that cultural component play in people talking to each other again, plays into whether this stuff gets done and whether neighborhoods can start participating in the political process.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1455.149s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1461.334s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1461.854s">And</a> by the way, block parties are one of the biggest examples of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1464.896s">Like</a> that might seem like a small thing, but it's a sign in my it's like a vital sign, in my opinion, of like a healthy neighbor.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1493.844s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1494.325s">Well,</a> some of the more relatable things would just be discovering new restaurants and trying new things on the menu and discovering like, oh, we've got Wright's Pond in North Medford that has its own beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1505.289s">You</a> know, that's not a lot of towns have that, you know, that aren't oceanfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1510.81s">So</a> there's just a lot of cool stuff that I've been discovering. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1515.532s">sort</a> of a behind-the-scenes satisfaction is just seeing how How much common ground that there is with all the people that I talked to I really enjoy the conversations that I have with people and just finding out that like this person who would Never associate with that person actually has so much So much of a common description of what they consider the strengths and the weaknesses of the city, you know, and and so there really is like a <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1542.509s">a</a> ton of budding potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1544.33s">And</a> it's just seeing that validated is really reinforcing, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1549.471s">So</a> that's one of my favorite things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1550.512s">But</a> negative things is the counter to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1554.293s">Well,</a> first of all, driving over all those potholes all the time, that's definitely a negative thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1558.635s">Passing</a> by a lot of these things that have so much potential, but it's just not realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1563.456s">Those</a> boarded up buildings, those neighborhoods that could be having block parties and could be getting together but aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1572.139s">Um,</a> and then also just the people who are talking past each other, but, but missing the opportunity to sort of connect, you know, like two ships in the night.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1597.925s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1630.236s">Thank</a> you, John, for giving me a platform to talk about some things that are just quick soundbites.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1782.03s">I</a> can tell, and you've got a lot in the pipeline.<h2><a href="../2025-06-23_XXXXXX00129/2025-06-23_XXXXXX00129.html">Patrick Clerkin</a></h2>
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=51.212s">Glad</a> to be here, Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=52.413s">My</a> name is Patrick Clerkin. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=53.853s">My</a> pronouns are he, him, and about myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=58.316s">I</a> grew up on Boston's North Shore, lived in Medford for nine years now, was a mechanical engineer, have been a handyman for a bit, have traveled the country on a bunch of road trips, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=71.739s">Yeah,</a> that's a couple things.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=92.478s">Gosh,</a> OK, so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=100.244s">It's</a> tough to choose, but I would say that it's a tie between Bob's Italian food, which is right down the street from me, and there's a lamb tip sub, which is awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=111.513s">And</a> then Rosso's, which is also fairly close to me, and they have a great vinegar, pepper, and fingerling potato pork chop, which I really enjoy.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=153.522s">Yeah,</a> definitely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=155.364s">So,</a> um. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=157.254s">Okay,</a> I'll start with the last time I ran, I really came out of the woodwork. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=162.937s">It</a> was actually someone I had been doing handyman work for had said that he wished more people were running and I was civically inclined. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=170.84s">So</a> I looked into it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=172.161s">But</a> I really jumped in like a week before the signature deadline. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=175.662s">And</a> so it was just a rapid fire immersion, learning everything that I could. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=182.625s">At</a> that point, I'd been in Bedford for seven years, but you really start to learn a lot more a lot quicker once you jump into the political fray. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=191.447s">I</a> did what I could that time, but ultimately, there was a lot of limitations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=196.148s">Three-month</a> time period, I was my own campaign manager, and I would say that my assessments of things and my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=207.766s">The</a> way that I was speaking was less matured than it is now and also less polished in the sense of I was working on a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=219.968s">I</a> was working in incubator at the time, I was trying to get an entrepreneurial idea started. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=223.731s">And</a> so my way of talking was a little bit more kind of like technical with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=227.774s">And</a> so I kind of came right into this, this public facing field and was maybe a little bit jilted and awkward with the way that I was talking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=235.64s">So</a> this time around, I really want to build off of the foundation from last time, but take some of the critiques and really, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=245.035s">run</a> a better campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=246.376s">The</a> second thing is I really want to focus on Medford in its entirety. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=251.919s">And</a> by that I mean, you know, not just conservative or progressive or libertarian, not just this precinct or that precinct, all of the precincts, all of the people, and really just take inventory of all the resources that Medford has. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=267.267s">So</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=268.427s">focusing</a> on Medford in its entirety, and I would say also focusing on Medford locally, you know, like what's happening within the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=275.733s">There's</a> clearly all kinds of things happening right now, you know, from a personal to local, state, national, global, but I really think that we have to, in this context, as a city councillor, I would need to focus on, you know, what's happening within the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=290.084s">So,</a> you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=293.006s">The</a> other part of your question was, what have I been doing since last time? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=297.488s">After</a> the tail end of the election, I was really like, okay, I want to do a postmortem on what it is that I did, what could I have done better, etc. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=309.598s">One</a> of the big things that I learned from that campaign was, yes, there are all these city issues, what I'll be focusing on again, like, you know, the streets, high school, fire station, the city budget, development. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=325.128s">But</a> one of the big things that wasn't really getting a lot of attention was the distribution of information, communications within the city, which I feel like is quite fractured and has resulted in people sort of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=341.07s">retreating</a> to various uh you know facebook groups and reddit pages and newsletters and sometimes it can be kind of like an echo chamber you know so i had really been trying to from january of 2023 i'm sorry january 2024 through memorial day of 2024 to work on a um an answer to that you know to fill the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=367.142s">information</a> void that I felt was in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=369.783s">And</a> I learned about how there previously had been a paper, but there hadn't been for, I don't know, maybe five years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=375.946s">But</a> getting a paper started would have been exorbitantly expensive, production run and getting the distribution out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=383.99s">So</a> what we settled on, it was me and a team of people that I was leading from who I had met. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=390.213s">during</a> the election who cared about this issue, we decided to choose a platform, it was the Mighty Networks platform, and to try to build upon that basically a local social media site dedicated to Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=405.683s">Not</a> like a group on a Facebook page, but a Medford-wide group for Medford residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=412.867s">And</a> there's all kinds of issues that arise with that is like, how do you have it be both open and somewhat moderated, where like, there's there's ground rules for it, you know, it's not like anyone can just stomp through and start lobbing grenades. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=426.557s">But</a> how do you have it be as open as possible, and we're creating sub sections on it that were dedicated to our specific topic areas like Medford dining, or recreation or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=442.068s">You</a> name it, really. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=442.748s">There</a> was a governance section as well, and this was really supposed to be a comprehensive hub, if you will, like a dashboard for existing Medford Media, and also adding on to that as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=459.294s">actually</a> the plan was to have, you know, this very podcast be one of the things that would be linked to that hub. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=465.318s">It</a> would it would be this podcast, it would be WMFO, the Tufts radio station, it would be Medford Community Media, anything related to the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=475.543s">Now</a> we have Gotta Know Medford, and there's a program Medford Happenings as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=481.947s">But</a> yeah, that was what I had been doing related to Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=485.769s">And</a> then around March of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=489.222s">last</a> year, I got, I started getting involved at national politics level with the Kennedy campaign, which is, you know, a controversial thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=498.75s">Some</a> people like him, some people hate him, but my entry point into that, and I want to, you know, people have been asking me about this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=506.437s">I</a> want to state that my involvement with that was basically, I felt that at a federal level and at a global level, the United States <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=522.138s">The</a> pharmaceutical industry and the food industry, the agricultural industry and the chemical industry have become a powerful lobby and that we're sort of immersed in chemicals and it has affected our health. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=535.921s">And</a> so that's one of the things that I felt like was a high priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=544.163s">And</a> I had previously, I know I've been going on at length here, but I had previously been working when I was an engineer as a chemical project manager at one point, where it was swapping out the chemicals in the mechanical systems from a chemical that was now considered a forever chemical and was very constrained to an alternative chemical. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=569.323s">And</a> I think what people don't realize is these forever chemicals like asbestos, like lead, these things that are very durable in construction environments are also very durable in biological environments, whether that be the ecological environment or whether that be in the human body. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=589.604s">And</a> so similarly to that, what people don't realize is that the industrial food supply in our country, the preservatives that get put in the food that keep them shelf stable, or actually, you know, like prevent them from rotting, basically, are actually the same preservatives that are being fed into our body continuously that, you know, have an effect over time, an aggregate effect. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=611.463s">And</a> so that was really how I started to get into that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=614.845s">And</a> like people, you know, I don't agree with everything, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=617.948s">I'm</a> not trying to delve into national politics here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=620.609s">I</a> don't agree with everything that, you know, Kennedy has done or everything that he has said. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=625.111s">That</a> was kind of my entry point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=627.292s">And</a> so I was involved from March through July with students for Kennedy, the goal of which was to get, you know, college students, particularly in Massachusetts, aware of his campaign because he was running as an independent candidate and to consider <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=647.881s">you</a> know, how on their campus they could organize awareness. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=652.406s">So</a> I was involved with that and once his campaign ended at the end of August, I was at both the RNC and the DNC, once his campaign ended at the end of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=670.178s">August,</a> I started getting involved with this unity coalition concept, which was basically like, how do we get, there's clearly this major political divide, how do we get <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=681.801s">the</a> populists, like the Bernie supporters, the Trump supporters, the Kennedy supporters, that have a lot in common with each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=687.444s">They're</a> reform-oriented people that see all these systemic problems. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=691.426s">How</a> do you get them to see what they have in common with each other and work together, basically? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=697.709s">And</a> that was a tall order, but that was what I was working on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=703.903s">And</a> then I sort of, you know, once the election happened, it was kind of like, okay, now I can re immerse myself and in Medford stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=711.328s">And</a> so I started showing the local meetings and stuff again.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=744.617s">um</a> it was the website it's uh it was once again it's called the medford community network it's mcn02155.com it's still operational but it's incomplete so the original goal was to like basically find local representatives for each of these topic areas you know one of them was dei one of them was um uh as i mentioned a bunch of them before to find local sort of um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=773.225s">leaders</a> or people who were stores of tribal knowledge basically and get them to be the representative for that topic area and to to build out the page on the site and then to to you know invite others to uh to engage in those spaces basically so the goal was to not only have all these different spaces on the site but to also have a like a hub space that would be like the equivalent of a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=801.129s">A</a> virtual cafeteria where, you know, you could go on to Medford community community networks and say, oh, I want to, I only care about the arts and culture and the city government. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=812.213s">I</a> don't care about this other stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=813.714s">So</a> you could, you could do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=816.675s">And</a> you could. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=818.556s">Like</a> each of the sections would have its own calendar of events, and those calendars would migrate their events towards the main calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=827.265s">So</a> if you only cared about two pages, you'd only be getting the events of two of those pages on your main calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=832.851s">And</a> you would also have the space where you could go and engage with other people in like a digital common <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=842.295s">forum</a> basically that would be you would allow cross-pollination of ideas and awareness but it was all right there it was all like the digital version of a of a shopping mall where it has all these storefronts in it and the goal was to not only have that be um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=860.237s">pulling</a> together all these components digitally, which I feel like Reddit is more... First of all, one of the problems with Reddit is it's anonymous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=867.583s">The</a> anonymity factor really, I feel like, undermines, in a local context, that community building because it allows people to be... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=881.913s">some</a> cases nasty to each other and in some cases to do things that they would otherwise not do to people if they had their name or their or their photo associated with their account. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=892.78s">So</a> one of the things was to get people to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=897.797s">be</a> open about, you know, their they didn't have to use a photo of themselves, but like, at least their name, you know, a real person, it would be focused on residents, because as far as I know, there's not really a constriction with the Reddit page as to like, you could be a non Medford resident, you can still be on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=915.723s">And</a> then just like, yes, we have this digital thing, but also encouraging people to go and interact with each other in the real world, basically, these events are these various things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=925.972s">And</a> that's what builds the civic, the social fabric.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1074.079s">somewhat</a> improvising in the sense of like, you know, I'm certainly not modeling myself after, after RFK, I'm modeling myself after <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1085.44s">My</a> politics, I'm more of an independent centrist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1089.383s">And</a> when I say that, I don't mean I don't have opinions on things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1092.865s">I</a> don't mean I'm a fence-sitter and I'm like, can't we all just get along, man? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1097.148s">What</a> I mean is in the aggregate, my opinion on this issue might lean more progressive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1102.471s">On</a> this issue, it might lean more conservative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1104.433s">On</a> this one, it might lean more libertarian. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1106.814s">But,</a> um, so, so, yeah, there's no real model model on and I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm improvising on a large way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1115.859s">But</a> when it comes to what you're saying about Kennedy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1120.382s">Yeah,</a> I, you know, I would say that my personal take on it with when it comes to like, vaccines is like, I think vaccines have have were like, 1 of the miracles of of modern science. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1130.81s">And</a> I think that they helped to prevent a lot of the naturally occurring diseases like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1137.255s">you</a> know, measles would be one of them and, you know, like typhoid, I'm not sure if these were vaccine diseases, but like typhoid and tuberculosis and malaria and like, you know, hepatitis and all these various things, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1152.838s">I</a> feel like it gets into more dangerous territory once you start getting into gain-of-function research because there's, that's where the, first of all, I feel like people assume that when you question sort of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1167.698s">some</a> aspects of medical science that you're like anti-science and I think that is some people are but like I think that it's dismissive because there's really a lot of valid critiques of the pharmaceutical industry you know which is like they fund a lot of medical science and so it would be like saying <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1190.47s">it</a> would be wrong to critique military policy coming out of the Pentagon, because yes, the Pentagon, they're in theory the experts, but they get a lot wrong, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1200.312s">So</a> I feel like, on the one hand, critiquing the pharmaceutical industry is different than critiquing the science. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1210.751s">And</a> the other concern is like when I just what I just mentioned with gain of function research is like, and this is a rabbit hole, but there is a Pentagon slash. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1223.406s">defense</a> agency partnership with pharmaceutical companies on bioweapons, and people don't really realize that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1233.072s">They</a> don't really realize the history of the bioweapons program in the U.S. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1236.594s">and</a> global bioweapons programs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1239.516s">They</a> don't really understand <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1241.497s">Going</a> back to World War II, how the Japanese had Unit 731, which was a bioweapons facility, and the United States, after the end of World War II, inherited that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1254.244s">It's</a> just like Joseph Mengele was sort of that experimenter at Auschwitz. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1261.868s">The</a> Japanese also were experimenting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1263.889s">And</a> so that bioweapons program combined with American bioweapons programs and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1270.932s">I</a> don't remember if it was like Fort Detricks or Fort Dix, but we had our own facility. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1275.714s">It</a> ties into pharma, it ties into military, it ties into various aspects of US policy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1286.339s">And</a> I feel like that is worthy of critiquing because one of the concerns is that, where does medicine and health policy begin versus defense and military policy?
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1377.592s">Yeah,</a> like I'm basically a federalist in the sense of like, I believe that there's the realm of the personal, the realm of the local, the state, the federal, the global. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1387.657s">And</a> that doesn't mean that they don't lead into each other, of course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1391.259s">But</a> I think what people, you know, like some people have said to me, well, all politics is local. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1396.661s">Tip</a> O'Neill said that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1397.561s">And</a> it's like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1398.822s">I</a> understand like what's meant by that like local politics is where the rubber hits the road, so to speak, but I also like that's a slogan and and so like there's some truth to it, but like saying all politics local is like saying all all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1418.721s">all</a> life is cellular, you know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1420.962s">Like,</a> it's like a human, the human organism is composed of cells, which make up tissues, which make up organs, which make up organ systems, which make up the organism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1429.826s">And</a> so clearly, not all the functions of the organism could happen at the cellular level, to draw an analogy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1436.149s">So</a> like, what I'm what I'm trying to say is like, there's levels of complexity and levels of order, that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1443.818s">really</a> can only be handled at higher levels. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1446.559s">And</a> so it's not to say that like, clearly Medford doesn't exist in a vacuum. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1450.922s">Like</a> I've mentioned this before, it's like there are effects of higher level things that come down to the Medford, there's the animosities that exist among people in different groups, there's technologies, there's inflation, there's immigration, there's there's these things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1470.192s">But</a> I so you know, as they <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1474.227s">affect</a> the city like i i feel like you you can obviously comment i'm not sitting like no no we can't comment on um you know like that student granted some people say you shouldn't like because it was in somerville but it was right on our doorstep that student that was uh was abducted by ice uh i'm not saying that shouldn't be talked about that was right in in our area but what i'm saying is the example of like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1500.748s">you</a> know, there was one meeting where it was calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and then calling for an end to the to the the American embargo of Cuba. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1510.314s">That</a> to me is like going out of your way to find an issue to make it the city's issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1516.218s">And</a> I just felt like that was like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1518.92s">That</a> wasn't just like, let me say that this is going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1523.383s">And</a> it's it's it's unjust that that was like that took like hours out of the meeting and it pushed the other things out of the way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1530.408s">And</a> at the end of it, it's like, we don't really. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1533.153s">It's</a> not really something that the city council is capable of.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1596.294s">Yeah,</a> I think that it's like for some of the issues that you mentioned, like if it was addressing prejudice within Medford, I think that would be one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1605.002s">If</a> it was addressing an abortion clinic within Medford, things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1609.887s">But</a> talking about some of these general things, I think it overwhelms the city's capacity to address the things that are within its
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1642.507s">So</a> yes, and that's why I think that those should happen through things outside of the city council, like action networks and in various organized groups and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1652.49s">It's</a> really, my point isn't that people shouldn't talk about these things or have opinions about them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1657.691s">My</a> point is ultimately, is city council the place to address these things in this way, basically? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1666.314s">And</a> if we allow, and I feel like people, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1671.65s">assume</a> that i'm specifically targeting like progressive policies in this and in reality it's like i i would be the same with conservative or libertarian or whatever like it's really like once you open the door for this it really overwhelms the like there are core functions that the government is is supposed to uh deliver on and our capacity to deliver on those gets <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1699.525s">marginalized</a> and pushed to the perimeter when it becomes sort of an open forum to address any topic, basically.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1745.824s">I</a> mean, on that specific meeting, I'm not sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1750.518s">recently</a> um there was a charter uh there was a charter thing that got kind of pushed late so like my concern is and this is this other issue isn't entirely city council or any one uh entity or person's fault this has been a cumulative issue that what i was talking about before with the city communications i think that because the communications have um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1774.578s">degraded</a> over time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1776.359s">And</a> by the way, I scoured the city website over the last two weeks and really went into every nook and cranny to find important plans and important maps and things that I felt like the public might have been missing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1790.868s">Because</a> I think that there's this notion that just because something gets put onto the municipal website that it gets beamed into everyone's brain, which clearly isn't true. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1800.64s">And</a> so, yeah, the point of what I'm saying is, a lot of people feel that some of these plans and some of these proposals get dropped out of the void into their consciousness at the last minute, past the moment of public comment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1817.328s">And</a> so some people show up to these meetings to speak on these Medford issues and to hear on these Medford issues, and then they find out that, you know, that issue is being displaced to the end of the meeting so that people can talk about trying to solve the, you know, the Gaza crisis or the ending the embargo in Cuba. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1837.896s">And</a> then they go home eventually because they're like, you know what, I can't spend three hours here, four hours here, into the wee hours of the morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1850.086s">I</a> was hoping that I could get this addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1853.648s">That's</a> where I'm saying like, I really feel like people sense that it's like a lack of compassion in me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1859.73s">It's</a> not that I lack compassion on these issues, it's that I feel like some of these are just the wrong place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1864.972s">Like</a> the Gaza issue or the Cuban, and I don't mean to just harp on those two things, but those are the most obvious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1871.354s">It's</a> like the amount of complexity that it's like, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1878.013s">it's</a> it's like the the what the UN and some of these global governments haven't even been able to address these things and I feel like like you know the everyday person can get involved through like an action network or through organized means but I just think that it's really it's wading into very very deep waters that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1902.264s">local</a> government doesn't have the capacity to handle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1906.614s">And</a> I understand that people <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1911.326s">It</a> gives people comfort, but I think that can be dealt with by giving referrals to people to say, hey, you're being heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1918.53s">And</a> just so you know, like this, this isn't the best place to solve this, but there, there are resources like there's this group, there's this action network, there's this support group, there's this meetup group, there's this, there's other avenues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1932.759s">You</a> can petition the, the, the other higher level governments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1937.862s">There's</a> other avenues to, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1940.722s">enact</a> this, you know, I'm not implying like, hey, squash this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1945.348s">Don't</a> address it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1946.71s">Forget</a> about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1948.732s">Yeah,</a> it's like a particular thing that I'm basically taking.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1991.528s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1992.589s">I</a> mean, it's, it's, the answer is, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=1998.402s">Medford</a> can't solve those issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2000.643s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2001.203s">And</a> maybe people just need to hear that outright is like, this is not going to be solved in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2006.785s">And</a> it doesn't mean that it's not important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2010.626s">It</a> just means that there's, it's the wrong tool to use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2014.268s">It's</a> the wrong avenue to approach it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2016.629s">And</a> like, if we lose sight of like, if we try to make everything <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2021.617s">i</a> mean maybe this is like you know i mentioned i've been a handyman maybe this is like a handyman way of looking at it but and i know that's not handyman work is not you know work in the public sector but pools are for specific purposes and if you like if you start using things forever like if you start using uh you know a hammer for every for every purpose or a screwdriver for every purpose like that's not what it's intended for and you're gonna get <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2049.25s">you're</a> going to not only get bad results, but you're going to destroy the tool.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2074.559s">That's,</a> that's my point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2076.717s">They</a> had a way to address that, because the issue that you addressed was a local issue.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2096.868s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2097.949s">Ultimately,</a> I think what should also be considered is, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2102.493s">How</a> do we give people a sense of comfort, but without inflaming Islamophobia and antisemitism in a local context where it might have not existed at that point? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2116.785s">That's</a> another concern is like in addressing some of these things in the way that we're addressing them, we're creating inflammation and counter inflammation and sort of in some sense, bringing the war <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2128.926s">to</a> Medford and we have to be careful about like and that's just one issue but like any any of these things is like it creates inflammation and counter inflammation that makes the performance of of other functions lessened or more difficult.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2202.397s">I'm</a> fine with I'm fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2203.358s">Like</a> I actually this is one of my big things is like I've been so first of all, I understand that people a lot of people want catharsis, you know, there's so much happening right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2214.087s">And</a> there's so much that is unsettling and uncertain and disturbing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2218.39s">And</a> people people want an anchor point and they want a compass and they want like, you know, what the hell is happening? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2224.495s">Am</a> I going to be okay? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2226.196s">Is</a> the world going to be okay? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2227.537s">Is</a> that like, there's all these things, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2230.25s">And</a> so naturally I understand people looking for comfort. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2234.456s">I</a> don't mean to be dismissive of that by any means. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2239.202s">But</a> I will say that I'm very comfortable around people of different persuasions and people of different beliefs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2247.098s">I've</a> been in in virtually every group, politically, demographically, whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2253.584s">And</a> I find that like, you meet wonderful people in all of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2257.887s">And</a> then I find that you also meet assholes and all of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2260.61s">Like</a> there's there's people who are like, I think that people shouldn't be afraid to be prideful of whatever, you know, that all that intersectionality, like whatever fragments of your identity, like, shine your it's your kaleidoscope, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2273.621s">You</a> know, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2275.498s">be</a> prideful, but don't be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2277.919s">This</a> is to all all groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2280.14s">Don't</a> be chauvinistic or militant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2282.481s">Because</a> some like any group can have the capacity to become a, like a dark version of itself, basically, you meet you meet people in any group who are, as I just said, chauvinistic or militant, where they take it beyond a healthy pride, to the point of like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2304.007s">Everyone</a> else must see the world through my sliver, basically, and pushing everything to the margins. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2310.494s">And</a> so I think that that needs to be kept in mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2314.238s">The</a> overall balance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2316.421s">I</a> think that Medford will do well when things are kept in balance and people don't have to be in fear. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2324.021s">But</a> they also shouldn't feel that they can dominate others. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2328.003s">I</a> feel like I've seen examples of that from a lot of different corners, and so the fault doesn't lie exclusively on any one group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2336.748s">But</a> I'm hoping that we can transcend that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2341.787s">Yeah,</a> so I'm comfortable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2343.328s">I</a> very much am comfortable with different groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lkP0aJyhqdYr7q34R7wmL?t=2346.691s">If</a> I got invited or was, you know, as long as, you know, I'm not being chased away with a bat, I would feel comfortable going into any circle.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10643.564s">Patrick</a> Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10646.466s">I</a> actually like this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10648.608s">I</a> thank the Councilors that put it forward for putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10654.133s">But</a> I also think it's half the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10655.934s">So</a> I do think that people tend to, not everyone, but a lot of people tend to bloviate and they tend to like a gas fill whatever space is given to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10665.923s">And</a> I think that Medford is going through a tough time of transition and transformation right now, and that we're pretty dysfunctional. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10674.751s">And</a> so I do think that it is important to have some measures like this in place to, to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10683.584s">rain</a> people in a bit and I think in a functional city, you have the public and the governing bodies, holding each other accountable, as well as having some degree of self regulation but you can always rely on the self regulation so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10699.111s">I</a> like what was put forward, and I like that Councilor Callahan suggested some alternatives to it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10707.193s">The</a> other half of this, though, is that I think that the council should potentially consider, and the committee's address is part of this, but putting maybe less agenda items per agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10718.396s">And</a> then the second thing, and I've mentioned this before, is staying within the realm of local issues, because bringing in national and global issues as well <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10727.978s">a</a> couple weeks back, Gaza and the embargo in Cuba, tonight talking about some of the big oil company issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10739.444s">Those</a> might touch on local issues to some extent, but I think that it also massively extends the conversation beyond the local purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10750.689s">And</a> we'll, as time goes on, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10756.092s">very</a> much track, like even if everything that was talked about here was put into effect, I think that it would still extend the conversation into the hours of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10765.854s">So</a> something that I've been focusing on on the side is just filling the communications and information void in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10774.175s">And</a> if outside of council, some of the councillors wanted to talk to me on how to better reach the public in certain ways, I'd be open to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10782.617s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17585.796s">Patrick</a> Lurken, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17589.518s">Like</a> Councilor Tseng, I'm a man who appreciates nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17592.64s">And</a> on this particular topic, I think that it's an example of a mistake we all often make, which is comparing the best aspects of something that we support with the worst aspects of something that we don't, rather than the best and worst aspects of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17609.269s">And</a> so really what I'm addressing here is kind of the philosophy behind this rather than kind of the details of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17615.533s">And</a> I think one of the mistakes that's made with with fossil fuels and I have many many criticisms against the fossil fuel industry, and it's negative externalities, but we're comparing a mature industry with against an industry that isn't mature yet which is renewables. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17634.73s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17635.751s">Fossil</a> fuels is a fully scaled enterprise at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17638.832s">And</a> it's sort of like comparing Facebook as a startup to Facebook as a mega corporation, because we are not really aware of the externalities of scaling renewable energy yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17652.997s">We</a> don't know the externalities of scaling windmills or solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17657.219s">We</a> have small arrays of these things so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17661.06s">Everything,</a> once you scale it, has <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17664.741s">side</a> effects and has unintended consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17668.164s">So</a> windmills, for example, you have to source the materials from all across the globe through supply chains, some of which might be in fraught regions which require forever wars like oil has, some of which might require child labor to produce, some of which might have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17689.274s">byproducts</a> that you have to accumulate in big open pits. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17693.177s">Some</a> of them might have concentrated waste products like nuclear fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17700.062s">Some</a> of them might have dispersed waste products like the CO2 emissions of fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17707.006s">So</a> when you really look at this from a systems level perspective, which we're not really used to doing, there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17716.573s">complexity</a> and a lot of nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17718.636s">And</a> I just want to remind people that while the fossil fuel companies are by no means saints, they're also not <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17730.336s">purely</a> villains either. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17731.717s">We</a> do live in a world that has been for better or worse defined by the industrial revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17737.901s">And</a> I think that fossil fuel companies just like renewables companies are improving their products all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17744.626s">And</a> so we should just keep this in mind when we put these carrots and sticks in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17749.79s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks/2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks.html">City Council 02-06-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11401.778s">Once</a> again, Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11404.099s">I</a> just wanted to be simpler with what I said before, which is it basically comes down in my eyes to, if this is a question of equal pay for equal work, you have to make sure that you're comparing equal things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11415.321s">If</a> it was comparing a school committee that was all men and a school committee that was all women that were getting different pay, that would be one thing, but you're changing multiple variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11424.104s">You're</a> comparing not just <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11427.325s">men</a> and women, mixed bodies, but you're also comparing a school committee and city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11432.749s">So</a> you either have to demonstrate that it is equal work or if it's not equal work, you have to demonstrate why there should be equal pay for an equal work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11443.377s">That's</a> basically what I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11445.098s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2023-10-02_XXXXXX00087/2023-10-02_XXXXXX00087.html">Patrick Clerkin (City Council)</a></h2>
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=53.465s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=54.406s">Thank</a> you for having me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=55.346s">My</a> name is Patrick Clerken, and you'll see on a lot of my signage, my first name is actually Charles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=60.751s">So</a> if you see Charles, that is Patrick. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=63.313s">My</a> pronouns are he, him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=65.555s">And</a> my backstory is I've lived in Medford for seven years now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=70.243s">I</a> live in the Tufts practice fields area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=73.324s">And</a> what got me to, I'm sorry if I'm skipping ahead and you're gonna ask this question anyway, but what got me into this race was a neighbor said, oh, I really wish someone would join. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=82.189s">So</a> that was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's really been this cumulative process of me getting more and more involved in the neighborhood that I live in because community neighborliness is something that I really value. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=94.875s">So</a> I feel like it's been a long time coming.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=113.17s">So</a> I really, people will argue with me over what qualifies as a restaurant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=117.591s">Like</a> I say, a cafe, I would say I really like Brownder, which is right near me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=124.672s">I</a> really like Rosso's on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=128.712s">Particularly,</a> they have a pork chop with fingerling potatoes and vinegar peppers, which I find really delicious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=138.122s">So</a> I'll give you the specific dish as well.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=168.928s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=169.168s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=170.108s">I</a> think that what you'll see in a lot of my campaign imagery and various sites and social media is this image of the bridge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=178.15s">And</a> it's because, uh, throughout my life, I've been involved in a lot of different, uh, organizations or jobs where I find myself basically being this, this mediator role between different groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=191.413s">So</a> I'm a mechanical engineer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=193.617s">And</a> I worked in a corporate job for a little bit as an employee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=197.659s">I'm</a> now a contractor for that same company. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=200.2s">But</a> I was often between the engineers and the marketers who really speak a different language. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=205.943s">And</a> they're both valuable, but in isolation, they can go way to the extreme. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=213.026s">And</a> that's what I find in a lot of political situations is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=219.55s">I</a> think that people get really bogged down in the culture wars, and I'm not saying that there's no value in the culture wars, but I think that conservatives and progressives can actually have a lot of areas of agreement and overlap that they don't necessarily realize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=235.957s">And</a> I think that I can be sort of a fundamental link between them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=240.539s">To</a> give you some other examples of me being sort of this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=244.317s">this</a> bridge or this intermediary role is when I was in college, I went to Northeastern. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=251.6s">I</a> joined a fraternity, Alpha Kappa Sigma, and I am now out of college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=256.563s">I'm</a> on the fraternity trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=258.504s">And</a> so that means basically working between the different generations, the alumni and the actives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=266.688s">Growing</a> up, went to a church and I grew up in North Reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=270.24s">and</a> the Union Congregational Church. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=272.581s">And</a> I was on their board, the House Committee, which dealt with sort of handyman type stuff around the church, the church grounds and facilities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=284.707s">And</a> so that was dealing with a lot of different groups of people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=286.648s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=286.968s">I</a> just often find myself in this position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=289.47s">So</a> it seems a little bit destined. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=291.871s">I</a> think I can really do it for Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=294.812s">I</a> have a lot of patience and a lot of curiosity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=297.073s">And</a> I think it's a role that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=299.062s">is</a> needed right now because I've seen a lot of animosity.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=309.216s">Yeah,</a> I've been watching a lot of Parks and Rec too to get myself prepared for some of the things I might see.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=328.316s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=329.937s">I've</a> used that term before and I differentiate that from obviously a pessimist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=335.835s">and</a> a naive optimist, which is kind of like the, we all know the pessimist, or maybe it's optimist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=343.518s">Well,</a> I was gonna say the meme with the dog with everything on fire. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=345.919s">You</a> know, I guess that's more of an optimist, but, and he's saying, oh yeah, everything's fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=351.181s">But</a> a naive optimist to me is the like, oh, like good vibes only, nothing wrong here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=357.203s">And</a> so I'm not naive to the problems of the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=362.462s">But</a> I believe it or not, I am actually optimistic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=364.523s">I</a> think that people, like I said before, I think people have more in common than they realize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=368.964s">It's</a> just untapped right now.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=404.444s">So</a> two things that come to mind right away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=407.166s">The</a> first is relations between <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=410.772s">tenants,</a> landlords, homeowners, and developers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=415.334s">I</a> see that has a big core as to what Medford has been and what Medford wants to be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=421.236s">And</a> people have different opinions on both of those and very strong opinions because those are opinions that are not purely objective. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=429.339s">They're</a> wrapped around people's identities, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=431.499s">And</a> anything that's wrapped around your identity is going to be fraught and difficult. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=436.241s">And</a> so trying to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=439.547s">bring</a> those different interests to the table in a way that allows them to see that you do need balance among these things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=448.955s">There</a> are different roles in an ecosystem, you have to look at Medford as an ecosystem and to say we need to basically prioritize homeowners above renters or renters above homeowners. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=461.67s">Unless</a> it's a very specific context, it's kind of like saying, oh, we should just get rid of pine trees in the ecosystem and not thinking that's going to have rippling consequences, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=473.42s">I</a> do think there's a balance that's kind of underappreciated right now when people have these narrow special interest views. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=480.726s">So</a> that's one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=482.687s">And</a> the other thing is transparency. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=485.47s">People</a> talk about it a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=486.53s">It's</a> become a buzzword, but I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=490.644s">not</a> just transparency, but the ability to communicate between the mayor and the council and the school board, between all of the departments of City Hall, and then between the constituents of Medford across all 16 precincts and City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=508.93s">So</a> it's like there's a lot of siloing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=513.652s">And</a> I think that when, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=518.535s">When</a> we look at the issues out on the streets, like the potholes in the roads, I, like most people in Medford, want to see those fixed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=526.177s">But</a> I also want to get across to people that it's often the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=530.479s">It's</a> not just what you see in front of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=533.039s">It's</a> also a behind the scenes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=535.26s">And</a> like I said before, I have the patience to kind of disentangle that mess. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=541.802s">If</a> you ever worked with a box of holiday lights that are all tangled up in a knot, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=548.167s">I</a> have the patience of working with different people with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=550.656s">So</a> that's what I really am going to try to bring to this.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=643.089s">Yeah,</a> I think it's like what you mentioned with the renaming of the Columbus School to the Mississippi Tuck School is a good example of these various groups that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=654.051s">any</a> given issue isn't just in isolation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=656.912s">It's</a> chained to a whole bunch of other issues, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=659.433s">And</a> so that isn't just seen as a simple, for the various sides involved, it's not seen as a simple one-off change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=671.516s">It's</a> different groups of people feeling <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=675.985s">sort</a> of this anxiety of are we being slowly eroded or erased here, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=680.388s">And</a> I think that what I'm trying to bring to the table is more like explaining to people the fuller context of things and sort of reassuring them that like this isn't a symbolic of, you know, if someone's saying, I don't want the school to be renamed because it's, you know, like there's a proud history here for us, like I understand <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=704.737s">that</a> they're not saying that they're proud of all the terrible things that Columbus might have done, aside from the good things that he might have done, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=715.661s">I</a> also would try to explain that this isn't part of a large conspiracy to erase <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=724.858s">your</a> cultural history from Medford, it's more to sort of balance things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=729.342s">And</a> there's always a give and take, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=731.524s">I</a> really do think that a lot, like there's a missed opportunity where a lot of people feel that they're approached on these topics in a very adversarial way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=742.032s">And</a> it's just like the conversation from there only starts with people digging their heels in, and it only gets worse from there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=750.96s">So</a> it's funny because, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=753.998s">I</a> have some policy ideas, but I also think a big part of this is just cultural, where you've got to get people to, like I said before, put down the guns and the standoff where everyone's got a gun pointed at each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=766.467s">And</a> that's not just a me thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=770.37s">I'm</a> going to do my best to do that and treat all the different parties with respect. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=775.293s">That</a> doesn't mean that I think that any given party is fully right on anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=780.894s">that's</a> not just a me thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=782.155s">Like</a> a lot of people need to pull together to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=784.176s">So</a> I'm going to try to at least display that as much as possible.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=809.598s">Well,</a> I've already started it to an extent, I've tried to incorporate it as much as I can in my campaign where I have tried to meet with all the other candidates that are running to various degrees of success I know people are busy but I'm at least trying to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=828.945s">have</a> sent letters to all the city hall departments basically being like, look, I'm not trying to get you to rat on anyone or anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=835.909s">I'm</a> not trying to get you to put yourself in a hot seat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=838.87s">I</a> can understand if you don't want to, but what are the things that you think work well in your department that you think don't work well, that kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=845.914s">And</a> it was to every department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=847.294s">I</a> didn't just focus on one area or another. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=851.216s">So</a> it's kind of bringing the voices to the table in a broader way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=858.846s">And</a> with the expectation that, okay, this is going to be a constructive conversation rather than like a quick devolution into the depths of the culture wars, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=874.424s">Because</a> there's a lot of baggage that comes with that.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=912.559s">How</a> to own some of the work on the ground, is that what you asked? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=918.061s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=918.741s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=919.062s">So</a> almost borrowing from the idea of the fireside chat from like 70 years ago or whatever, this idea of having an update for people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=930.606s">And</a> I hope that can somehow merge into the idea of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=936.002s">a</a> common source that people can reference. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=940.505s">It</a> used to be print journalism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=942.126s">I</a> don't know to the degree that it will be print journalism, but I do know that everyone has their own facts now or their own thing that they check. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=950.471s">So</a> trying to bring some of that into ideally something that could be distributed to the different precincts in Medford so that people have an idea of what's going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=964.071s">And</a> then another idea that I had was how people could contribute and understand and put forward better ideas is inspired by basically Google Maps, where on Google Maps, you have these different layers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=979.683s">You</a> can see the transit layer, the business layer, the recreation layer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=984.367s">And</a> I was thinking, what if Medford had basically that, but for each department, where each department submitted a map that represented its ongoing projects or where its key <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=994.255s">uh,</a> resources are located. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=996.216s">I</a> don't, you know, if it's, if it's all the schools, if it's all the spiritual stuff in Medford, if it's all of the, um, the, uh, street repairs under construction, everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1007.282s">And</a> then you, you basically brought that together in some form of, uh, document and, and made it accessible for everyone so that when they put forward ideas for projects, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1018.52s">It</a> kind of forces them to see Medford in a more multi-dimensional way rather than just, oh yeah, take all the money out of the budget and put it towards my project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1030.807s">Those</a> are two ways.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1086.546s">So</a> I would imagine that all these various groups aren't just some people lumped together and cluster together, but there's probably also quite a spread of all these different groups across Medford, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1100.872s">And</a> so I would hope that in just making sure that each of the precincts has access to, like what I was saying before, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1115.39s">the</a> journalism or if there's a new repository that's put on the website, making sure that the marketing is put towards each precinct rather than just where most of the money is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1131.593s">I</a> would say that's really at a granular level, probably as far as I can go, and I have to trust that the rest of it needs to happen with other on-the-ground people and micro-community leaders in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1145.266s">I'm</a> trying to focus on the arteries and the veins, and I need other people to focus on the capillaries, because I can't do it all myself, and nor would I try to do it all myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1159.657s">I</a> want this to be a group effort, and I want to, like I said before, bring the voices to the table, and not just the loud, angry voices in every group, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1175.516s">you</a> know, really some of the voices that get talked over a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1180.06s">And</a> I'm not, I'm not saying anyone, any group in particular here, because I feel like once I say, oh, I'll do this for a particular group, it's just this very polarized time that we live in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1192.99s">People</a> just assume that you mean, oh, well, yeah, to the exclusion of this other group, you're gonna focus exclusively on them, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1201.717s">So</a> I'm not trying to be like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1204.406s">evasive,</a> per se, when I am answering this way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1207.428s">It's</a> more like, it's trying to preserve some degree of neutrality in the campaign so that people truly see this as representative of all of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1217.295s">And</a> not just in this lumpy way of, oh, we are all one, and kind of just marginalizing some of these voices that you're talking about, but in a way that is almost like a mosaic, where it brings together all the differentiation in a bigger whole.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1240.551s">Probably</a> equality of, I'm trying to say it without the word equality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1248.595s">It's</a> access rather than results oriented, I think, or yeah, equality is based on, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1264.153s">Sort</a> of like let the chips fall where they may getting people to a position where, where, you know, everyone's given the same opportunity but but then let the chips fall where they may and then equity is is trying to more level the playing field I think to go a bit further.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1402.912s">I</a> think using existing resources and institutions to try to make sure that people know what is already available is pretty critical. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1412.618s">And</a> like I said, I think that you can get, even in an already local situation, you can get very micro-targeted with how deeply you want to go with any of this stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1427.067s">So</a> I'm trying to do with what's in reason here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1432.508s">you</a> know, partnerships and pairings with various groups around Medford, I think, would help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1439.312s">But</a> yeah, like I said before, I don't want to just become associated with the, like, you're the X group candidate, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1447.917s">Or</a> you're the X group representative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1452.099s">I</a> do believe that there's a awareness problem <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1461.431s">And,</a> and obviously a, um, like there's been a discrimination problem and then there's also a motivation problem too, where it's like, um, you try to focus on the first two and then the, and then the third. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1475.417s">Could</a> continue to be a problem too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1477.297s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1477.478s">Cause</a> there's that old expression. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1478.738s">If</a> you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1481.019s">So</a> you, you basically want to get people, uh, as aware of things as possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1487.582s">You</a> want to get people encouraged, but you also have to realize that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1495.562s">Yeah,</a> so you can go crazy trying to force people sometimes to join into programs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1503.403s">And</a> then there's also a question of who truly represents any given group, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1508.044s">Because</a> do I represent white people just because I'm white? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1511.224s">Or</a> do I represent men as a group just because I'm men? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1514.785s">There's</a> all kinds of diversity within groups as well that I think often gets overlooked. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1522.135s">I</a> don't know if any of these groups in Medford have specifically designated leaders in any capacity, or if they're informal leaders, or if they're just sort of these more polyglot groups of people that are leaderless and decentralized, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1544.785s">Like,</a> there's always gonna, like, if I said, oh, I'm gonna engage with this group, and I'm gonna engage with their leader, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1550.974s">half</a> of that group might then say, well, who the hell's anointed that person later, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1555.936s">So</a> there's, it gets very fractal, like it's very difficult if you get too granular. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1564.179s">So</a> I'm trying to, I'm trying to balance the pieces in the whole without getting lost in either, if that makes sense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1573.423s">And</a> I know that sounds kind of abstract, but it's, it's a, it's a tough balance to get right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1579.005s">You</a> know, and I, and there's a lot of, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1581.767s">suspicion</a> surrounding, uh, understandably politicians now because they lie a lot and they, uh, they make promises that they don't deliver. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1594.314s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1597.476s">Trying</a> to bring earnestness, earnestness, sincerity, working with people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1603.659s">If</a> things are brought to my attention to, to try to work with those groups, but I don't know everything about Medford, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1611.583s">I</a> it's every day is a learning experience.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1636.615s">Uh,</a> so I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1642.668s">I</a> briefly had a podcast, I left, it was called Nan vs. Mob. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1646.869s">And</a> it was basically this kind of similar to the themes that I've been describing throughout this interview of trying to kind of bring people together and rise above some of the kind of the more obnoxious aspects of people screaming in each other's faces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1666.174s">And</a> so that was, that was kind of what <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1669.162s">started</a> this trajectory probably before my neighbor ever brought up running for office of any kind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1678.586s">And</a> it started the trajectory if I did <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1683.448s">20,000</a> plus miles of driving around the country at the start of the pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1687.671s">I</a> wanted to see the country sort of not just the coasts, but, uh, between the coasts everywhere and off the interstates everywhere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1695.355s">And</a> so, um, yeah, this, this podcast that I did kind of launched me on this, uh, this trajectory of, of stepping away from that traditional corporate job and, uh, seeing a lot of things in a short amount of time, I'd say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1712.96s">and</a> just having conversations with people in a spread out, geographically spread out way.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1724.489s">And</a> I think that rental car companies, it's safe to say rental car companies probably have me on a list as don't rent to this guy because I put 18,000, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1732.255s">Yeah,</a> I put 18,000 miles on a rental car in like four weeks or something.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1751.78s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1752.44s">So</a> I have a fundraiser coming up on Thursday, September 21st at the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1758.401s">I'm</a> sorry, not at the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1759.881s">That's</a> in my head. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1760.862s">At</a> Ford Tavern, which is across from Wegmans in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1765.963s">And</a> that starts at 6 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1768.487s">like</a> I said, on Thursday, the 21st. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1771.429s">And</a> my website is now fully operational. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1774.331s">I've</a> been doing a lot of this, this stuff solo, you know, kind of like this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1780.095s">Like</a> I said, I'm not associated with any special interests or anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1782.857s">So</a> sometimes things take a lot longer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1786.18s">And</a> so my website, Clerken for Medford, that's C-L-E-R-K-I-N with the number four. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1793.033s">ClerkenforMedford.com</a> is now up and on Instagram it's at Clerken for once again number four Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1800.42s">So</a> that's primarily what I engage with and you'll probably see me out canvassing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/755pu0ktgnOScc1IjXfeWa?t=1805.504s">I'm</a> doing a lot of canvassing now.
