 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1156.349s">Hi</a> everyone, I'm Patrick Clerkin, and I'm going to start off with a little bit of my backstory, and then I'm going to get into why it's relevant and what I'd like to do for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1165.355s">So</a> I'm a mechanical engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1167.036s">I've</a> worked in both a corporate context as an employee and as a contractor, and I've also been an entrepreneur, and most recently I've worked as a handyman. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1178.504s">And</a> with the handyman work, it's been a lot of meeting neighbors, getting out there, and a lot of practical hands-on stuff, so it's kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1185.759s">combining</a> the street smarts and the book smarts and the abstract and the physical hands-on stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1192.963s">So</a> I have also been involved with a lot of different civic organizations, both as a member and as a leader within those organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1202.809s">Some</a> of them have been Habitat for Humanity, <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1205.199s">Big</a> Brother Big Sister, American Red Cross, and the board of my fraternity. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1210.543s">So</a> I want to bring all of those perspectives and experiences to my efforts here in Medford for the city's benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1217.97s">And</a> what I wanted to focus on in particular was robust community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1223.094s">And</a> how I see it, community is both communications and unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1227.576s">And</a> in 2023, when I ran for the first time, what I saw was that this city has so many resources and there's no hub of communications anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1237.078s">There</a> used to be a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1238.419s">There</a> isn't anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1239.179s">There's</a> some new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1240.439s">But</a> basically, there's not a dashboard or there's not a consistent reference that people are consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1245.861s">And</a> when you don't have that, it causes anger and fear and distrust and confusion to proliferate. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1252.638s">And</a> so I have a bunch of different ideas as to how to practically address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1257.021s">They're</a> on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1257.822s">I</a> can't get into all of them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1259.483s">So</a> I recommend that you consult my website for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1262.706s">But</a> I will say if you want a practical example as to how lack of communications negatively affects the city, look at the current zoning issue, how a lot of the people feel that this information has been dropped on them at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1275.275s">They</a> feel like things have already been decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1277.559s">they</a> feel like basically the neighborhoods aren't getting a say in this citywide process. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1284.582s">The</a> other aspect of what I wanted to focus on was unity, and I'm already embodying that democracy within my campaign where I've gone to all 16, canvassed all 16 precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1297.447s">I've</a> crossed demographic, geographic, partisan, ideological lines, talked to anyone, I don't care what <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1304.019s">what</a> flag you have in your yard, what letter you have next to your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1306.6s">I</a> want everyone to be involved in this process and I am actively doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1311.783s">So</a> the last thing that I'll say is that I'm focused on independent thinking, on practical solutions, on <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1321.129s">Medford</a> in its entirety and on local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1324.472s">So</a> I'm a Councilor, I would be a Councilor at large for Medford, not for Massachusetts, not for the United States, not for the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1331.378s">So</a> if these are values that you appreciate, please vote for me on September 16th and on November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/afnvZAYk2_M&t=1338.224s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council 08-05-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6963.219s">Patrick</a> Clerkin, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6965.87s">So</a> I wanted to address two particular sub-issues on this, and the first is related to the wholesale divestment from particularly the fossil fuel industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6979.997s">I</a> think that people don't realize the ripple effects of the fossil fuel divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6984.199s">There</a> are other industries, the chemical industry, the plastics industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6988.361s">I</a> have critiques of all of these industries, and I think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6993.343s">substantial</a> negatives to them, but there's also substantial positives to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6997.405s">A</a> lot of what we have that we take for granted are clothes, eyeglasses, equipment around us, medical equipment, vehicle equipment that reduce vehicle weight and that reduce vehicle emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7013.452s">A</a> lot of good things come from the fossil fuel industry and its byproducts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7019.455s">And</a> so I'm concerned with the wholesale divestment, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7022.958s">And</a> the second thing is, I think there are other industries that equally have downsides to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7030.546s">So</a> looking at defense, we're focusing on how the defense industries have more of an emphasis on <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7037.552s">war</a> rather than defense and peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7039.633s">I</a> understand that criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7041.814s">You</a> could add to the list media, which tends to emphasize getting people profiting off of getting people to hate each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7051.057s">You</a> could focus on the pharmaceutical industry, which often focuses more on sickness rather than on health. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7059.92s">I</a> think it's easier to focus on defense industries and fossil fuel industries when they're located geographically in say Texas or the or the south of the United States and not focus on the pharmaceutical industry which is in our own backyard which has <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7075.684s">jobs</a> and money flowing through the veins of Massachusetts more so than these things that we're trying to divest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7081.448s">And</a> I think it's very specific and odd to focus on just several of these things and wholesale divest from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7090.693s">So</a> I think if you look at the broad systems level perspective, there's tradeoffs everywhere, and I think it should be looked at more piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7098.958s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU/2025-07-10_-nzz6eWSWpU.html">Community Development Board 07-09-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=96.912s">So</a> I've been in Medford for nine years now, coming up in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=101.475s">And</a> before that, I grew up in North Reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=103.696s">I've</a> been a North Shore guy my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=105.957s">And</a> I went to North Reading Public School. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=109.479s">And</a> when I was in school, my favorite subjects were actually history, geography, and literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=115.843s">So</a> what does somebody whose favorite subjects are those do after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=120.106s">They</a> go to school for engineering, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=123.789s">I</a> went to Northeastern for mechanical engineering and it was it was partly <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=131.253s">My</a> high school had a couple programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=132.654s">It</a> was not like the Medford High School with these great vocational programs, but it had an architecture program or a class, I should say, an engineering class, and those sort of stoked my curiosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=143.359s">So</a> when I went to Northeastern Mechanical Engineering, did a couple co-ops there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=147.761s">If</a> you're familiar, they have this, you do classes one semester, jobs another semester. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=153.123s">That</a> was great because that was work experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=155.824s">And</a> I also got involved with a fraternity when I was there and was eventually the president of the fraternity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=162.268s">So</a> that's my entry point into leadership roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=165.77s">And</a> really post-college, I started working for a company in the semiconductor test industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=173.774s">Nothing</a> that you or I would ever work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=175.575s">It's</a> really company to company stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=178.396s">And</a> I was there for a couple years and I just kind of decided, you know, corporate was not really like I was too restless for corporate. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=186.408s">And</a> so I ventured out on my own and I really got involved with <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=193.358s">At</a> one point, I was doing my own entrepreneurial pursuit called Tether, and that was in the realm of communications and software. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=201.924s">And</a> then I also started making money through doing handyman work, which I really enjoyed because that was more practical, hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=211.191s">It</a> was very face-to-face with clients, and I got to know a lot of my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=215.334s">So</a> I'll say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=217.075s">Those</a> were sort of my entry points into, because people look at why you're involved in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=225.26s">Engineering</a> is sort of this profession that allows you to look deeply at problems from a systemic level and to look at the limitations of systems and to look at the possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=237.207s">So</a> it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=238.147s">It's</a> a combination of having gotten to know my neighbors through the handyman work. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=242.129s">And</a> I would say it's also the desire to be civically involved and an intermediary between people. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=249.473s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=264.097s">Yeah,</a> so I mentioned before that I started doing handyman work. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=268.3s">And</a> at one point, one of my neighbors said, oh, I really wish that we had better options for city council and that people were better addressing these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=278.687s">So</a> I looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=279.408s">That</a> was 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=280.909s">And</a> I really jumped in at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=282.93s">This</a> was like a week before the you have to get signatures to get your name on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=287.013s">It</a> was like a week before the signature deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=289.415s">So</a> when I say I was running for council, it was more like I was sprinting for council because it was such an immersive and quick process. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=298.46s">But</a> what I learned from last time, I didn't win last time, but what I learned was that one of the biggest issues that affects the city, that affects all of the problems that people see, is the communications issue that's citywide and it's gotten <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=315.87s">particularly</a> bad over the last five or six years with the lack of a common hub of information, like a city paper or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=324.519s">And</a> so now we have some of these new sources, like we've got Medford Happenings, we've got Gotta Know Medford, we've got some things that have filled that void. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=331.787s">But</a> after I ran last time, I really got this <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=336.192s">civically</a> oriented group of people together who really all saw the communications as a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=341.776s">And</a> we were meeting every week at the library, pretty much from New Year's to Memorial Day, trying to set something up. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=347.621s">And</a> what we came up with was called the Medford Community Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=350.883s">And</a> it kind of got shelved, but we got pretty far with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=355.447s">And</a> that's the foundation that I'm building upon this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=359.029s">I</a> have some ideas around improving the communications throughout the city.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=395.388s">Well,</a> so there's kind of two things that need to, two realms of problem that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=402.41s">One</a> of them is infrastructure, and one of them is more cultural in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=405.992s">And</a> so from the infrastructural side of things, I'm really focusing, first of all, on citywide issues and local issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=413.214s">But</a> the ones that I've put on the back of my literature are the city budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=418.976s">The</a> development, both commercial and residential, zoning is a big, big topic right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=425.342s">The</a> high school, what to do with that, whether it's going to be a new high school, whether it's going to be doing renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=434.452s">And</a> then the fire station is another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=436.994s">And</a> I think that was pretty much it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=441.178s">One</a> of the biggest things that I've noticed is lacking is it's unclear what the processes are for these things, or if there are processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=450.005s">And</a> I'm not putting that on any given person, but coming from that engineering perspective that I mentioned before, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=457.436s">What</a> I would be looking for is some kind of a flow chart that says, OK, this is the first stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=462.262s">This</a> is the second stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=463.743s">Does</a> it pass this stage? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=464.965s">Yes</a> or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=465.705s">If</a> it's a yes, it goes in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=467.528s">If</a> it's a no, it goes in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=469.169s">And</a> it says the different departments that are involved, the different stakeholders that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=474.796s">And</a> it really gives... <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=476.297s">It</a> would really add to the transparency and accountability that you often hear politicians talk about, which often unfortunately falls through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=486.924s">So</a> I think that there's ways to do that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=491.987s">fiddled</a> around, people talk a lot about AI these days, and I'm not really on the doom train. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=498.152s">I'm</a> not really on the hype train. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=499.653s">I</a> try to walk the middle path. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=501.675s">But</a> I was fiddling around with chat GPT and just asking it some questions like, you know, hey, generate for me a sample of a of a flowchart depicting a municipal Department of Public Works filling in cracks and holes in city streets, you know, what that would look like, or <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=521.13s">Or</a> show me what a typical budgeting process would look like for a city of 65,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=526.652s">And</a> it's a little bit wonky. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=529.372s">It'll</a> spit out something with typos. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=531.993s">But</a> generally, it's pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=534.674s">It's</a> impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=535.554s">And</a> I think that those could be models for what we could build in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=542.236s">That's</a> one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=543.016s">There's</a> others, but yeah.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=606.632s">Yes,</a> yes, and yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=607.954s">I</a> hear that problem all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=609.556s">I</a> mean, that's probably the biggest problem that I hear, and I do think it can be addressed and it can be solved, but it's not an easy snap your fingers fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=621.554s">Yeah,</a> the zoning thing right now that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=624.495s">I</a> would say that thankfully, I just saw the other day, the mayor is releasing a letter saying, hey, I think we should move the decision for this process to the fall because a lot of the public is feeling caught off guard or uninformed about this, and I think that's very much the right choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=644.199s">Let's</a> take the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=645.501s">A</a> lot of people feel like this information is being dropped out of the void at the last minute and that the public comment period has passed and that there are these sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=660.39s">uh,</a> in sincere efforts to get public opinion, like the, these, uh, cardboard cutout attempts to, to, hey, we're, we're listening to the public, but are you really listening to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=671.833s">And</a> so, um, once again, I'm not trying to, to put that on, on any given, you know, person. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=678.255s">Uh,</a> in some cases I do think it's deliberate where, you know, the, the process has already gotten to a certain point and all the consultants have gotten involved and, and it's just about done and it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=689.999s">Like</a> we don't want to get the public to shut this down at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=693.626s">So</a> let's kind of you know Pass it through the through the later hours of the night or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=699.297s">But</a> then I think other times there's <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=702.702s">there</a> really is information that's posted out there, but it's posted in one of the drawers of the bureau in the city website, and who is ever going to find that?
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=713.713s">It</a> doesn't come out of the drawer, and so a couple weeks ago I really scoured the city website, and I'll be the first to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=721.821s">The</a> new city website is actually, it has some problems, but it's much better than what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=727.365s">And</a> there's a lot of great stuff on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=728.986s">There's</a> maps of the city that show these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=731.447s">There's</a> all these different project proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=735.31s">But</a> if you don't know that they're there, like what good are they to some extent? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=740.033s">And</a> so so that's why I think that there needs to be a bunch of people in the city the council included Working together to to address that to work with this, you know, you've interviewed gotta know Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=752.917s">They</a> could be a new they could fill that void. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=755.258s">Yeah,</a> and and I think that the city <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=759.299s">On</a> the front page of the city website, there currently is a section that shows the quick links for city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=770.405s">And</a> then beneath that, there's news and events. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=773.266s">But</a> I think there needs to be either a link or a little bulletin board that shows all of the currently ongoing city projects and links to key maps and key project developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=785.592s">I</a> think that would go a long way as well.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=824.615s">Yeah,</a> I think it was the right choice.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=856.157s">Yeah,</a> I mean I don't think that the immediate, and things have gotten bad enough where to some extent people might feel that this is the only option that they have, but I don't feel like the answer is just to squeeze the life out of the homeowners, you know, and wrench money out of their equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=873.578s">You</a> know, it's not to say like taxes are a necessary evil, but I think if it's part of a bigger package and a wider lens view of how to balance the city budget, I do need to familiarize myself more with the the details of the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=888.129s">But</a> broadly, I think we need to focus on seriously <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=893.152s">increasing</a> and diversifying the commercial and industrial tax base, and you don't do that in the residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=899.738s">The</a> residential component of development is a separate issue, but you do it on the Mystic Ave corridor, you do it partly in the Wellington area, in East Medford, you do it in places that are already really <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=913.951s">you</a> know, zoned for and have significant commercial and industrial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=919.798s">I</a> think it's a damn shame that in the city, and this isn't just someone who's deeply at this point, I consider myself pretty aware of what's going on, but I've heard these comments from people who <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=930.169s">really</a> are just casually observing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=931.97s">They</a> go for walks with their dogs, they take notes of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=934.65s">But</a> some of these boarded up shops and stretches of boarded up windows, I have a friend who lives over near the royal house and we used to take my dog for a walk and it can't even be real. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=946.373s">There's</a> a sausage casing business and it's just been shut forever and there's a whole strip of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=953.016s">And</a> you see a lot of those types of things throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=956.079s">So</a> I think that the city can create certain incentives, like maybe expedited permitting processes could be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=964.947s">Maybe</a> the utilities are a mess, in the sense of particularly the streets, making streets in front of businesses more attractive.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=980.859s">And</a> there's other financial arrangements that can be made.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1013.321s">One</a> last thing is I do think that it doesn't have to be an either or thing of you have to wholly satisfy the homeowners or wholly satisfy the renters or wholly satisfy the landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1026.027s">It's</a> something that if it's done wisely, it can balance all of those forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1032.411s">Because</a> Medford at the end of the day is an ecosystem and you need all those groups.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1072.343s">Yeah</a> well It would be nice if there if there was an audit but that is there's been some resistance to that and When it comes to priorities in the city for for spending I would say <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1091.715s">putting</a> a significant amount of that money into projects that are already underway, like the fire station is a big one that was already promised to the firemen and the fire tower when the new police station was put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1112.128s">And</a> there's a plan for that on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1114.87s">So</a> seeing that through is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1118.916s">looking</a> seriously at how far we can stretch the money that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1124.719s">I</a> do think that, you know, Rick Orlando was on in one of your episodes and he was talking about the process of building schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1131.463s">The</a> school is one of these looming things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1133.284s">What</a> do we do with the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1134.565s">Do</a> we renovate it? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1135.346s">Do</a> we do it over again? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1136.726s">Well,</a> Rick talked about how if we're <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1139.628s">you</a> know, if we were even to consider redoing the school all over again, we're not going to get the same, you know, abatements as previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1147.39s">You</a> know, there was that racial balancing that paid for, you know, like 90% of the schools or 75% of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1153.572s">So</a> I think we should prioritize the school because this school does have this studio that we're in right now is a gem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1161.394s">There's</a> the robotics club that's a gem. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1164.255s">This</a> school has, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1166.976s">I'm</a> blanking on the name right now, Bistro 489. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1170.118s">There's</a> some really great stuff at this school, both vocational and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1174.641s">But</a> maybe we could look at it, how do we stretch our dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1180.504s">Some</a> people say, absolutely no way, never renovation, redo the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1184.187s">Well,</a> first of all, we're not going to get those refunds that we previously did. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1188.469s">Second</a> of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1189.69s">There's</a> good bones in this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1190.991s">There's</a> a lot of, I mean, it's a brutalist architectural style like the Boston City Hall, but maybe efforts could be done to make it more, you know, coming into the school to feel less sort of ominous, I would say.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1207.223s">And</a> to just renovate parts of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1209.825s">It</a> was built for a certain number of students that it currently is not filling, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1216.969s">I've</a> taken a tour of the whole school, so that is a goal of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1220.691s">I</a> have a neighbor down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1224.132s">a</a> couple, and they just moved here a couple years ago, and they're saying that they're already considering moving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1229.714s">Like,</a> they have a baby, they have another one on the way, and they're like, the school system, we just, you know, whether it's true or not, perception is reality to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1237.816s">And</a> they say, you know, we're moving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1239.737s">And</a> I think they're not alone with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1241.137s">There's</a> people who look at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1242.418s">So</a> I would consider that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1244.198s">A</a> hemorrhage within Medford is the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1248.162s">And</a> outside of that, I would just say, yeah, the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1253.266s">The</a> streets are a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1254.887s">And</a> putting forward on the city website, there's a plan for all the streets, prioritizing them by area. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1262.453s">Really</a> putting that forward and putting that next to that process flowchart that I was describing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1268.919s">So</a> people can see and hold the city accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1271.521s">Those</a> are the big ones.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1315.858s">see</a> it from two angles one is the on the streets level which is the meat and potatoes of like what is what is the average resident of Medford see and they see bad quality streets they see and unfortunately the bad things tend to stick out more than the good things and the things that are working you know you don't you know and when you're paying attention to things you don't go oh that's working really well you go oh that's a mess <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1337.547s">So</a> it's really unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1338.73s">But</a> people tend to lock into the things that aren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1341.415s">So</a> the state of the streets, the fact that we have a bunch of business sections that are <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1349.712s">more</a> worn down or mismatched or, uh, you know, not really diversified in the sense of, you know, not to, not to demean banks and credit unions and barbershops, but we have a lot as I walk around, we have a lot of both, both of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1363.342s">So,</a> um, a, a focus on the, what people actually see on the front end and then simultaneously on the back end, there's all these, these, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1373.911s">these</a> processes and communications failures that are happening that would make addressing the front end more possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1382.25s">And</a> I'll say that <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1384.283s">this</a> is both meat and potatoes and back end but I mentioned before how there's an infrastructural part of this and then there's also a cultural part just getting people to talk to each other again and not see each other as villains you know it's it's really like the number of people that have just disengaged has left the the smaller public square open to to be taken over by <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1410.433s">Brats</a> and bullies I would say And there's a lot of people who do participate who really just want to see things work and they're trying to get things work get things to work, but you know, there's there's also a lot of rancor and a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1428.502s">stuff</a> that sucks the oxygen out of the room, you know, and I do, I want to see neighbors talking to neighbors again and seeing each other as such, rather than like, you're a red, you're a blue, you're this, you're that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1442.226s">It's</a> not helping. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1442.966s">And</a> so that cultural component play in people talking to each other again, plays into whether this stuff gets done and whether neighborhoods can start participating in the political process.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1455.149s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1461.334s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1461.854s">And</a> by the way, block parties are one of the biggest examples of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1464.896s">Like</a> that might seem like a small thing, but it's a sign in my it's like a vital sign, in my opinion, of like a healthy neighbor.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1493.844s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1494.325s">Well,</a> some of the more relatable things would just be discovering new restaurants and trying new things on the menu and discovering like, oh, we've got Wright's Pond in North Medford that has its own beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1505.289s">You</a> know, that's not a lot of towns have that, you know, that aren't oceanfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1510.81s">So</a> there's just a lot of cool stuff that I've been discovering. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1515.532s">sort</a> of a behind-the-scenes satisfaction is just seeing how How much common ground that there is with all the people that I talked to I really enjoy the conversations that I have with people and just finding out that like this person who would Never associate with that person actually has so much So much of a common description of what they consider the strengths and the weaknesses of the city, you know, and and so there really is like a <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1542.509s">a</a> ton of budding potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1544.33s">And</a> it's just seeing that validated is really reinforcing, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1549.471s">So</a> that's one of my favorite things. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1550.512s">But</a> negative things is the counter to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1554.293s">Well,</a> first of all, driving over all those potholes all the time, that's definitely a negative thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1558.635s">Passing</a> by a lot of these things that have so much potential, but it's just not realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1563.456s">Those</a> boarded up buildings, those neighborhoods that could be having block parties and could be getting together but aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1572.139s">Um,</a> and then also just the people who are talking past each other, but, but missing the opportunity to sort of connect, you know, like two ships in the night.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1597.925s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1630.236s">Thank</a> you, John, for giving me a platform to talk about some things that are just quick soundbites.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k00YYHPhilI&t=1782.03s">I</a> can tell, and you've got a lot in the pipeline.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10643.564s">Patrick</a> Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10646.466s">I</a> actually like this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10648.608s">I</a> thank the Councilors that put it forward for putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10654.133s">But</a> I also think it's half the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10655.934s">So</a> I do think that people tend to, not everyone, but a lot of people tend to bloviate and they tend to like a gas fill whatever space is given to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10665.923s">And</a> I think that Medford is going through a tough time of transition and transformation right now, and that we're pretty dysfunctional. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10674.751s">And</a> so I do think that it is important to have some measures like this in place to, to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10683.584s">rain</a> people in a bit and I think in a functional city, you have the public and the governing bodies, holding each other accountable, as well as having some degree of self regulation but you can always rely on the self regulation so <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10699.111s">I</a> like what was put forward, and I like that Councilor Callahan suggested some alternatives to it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10707.193s">The</a> other half of this, though, is that I think that the council should potentially consider, and the committee's address is part of this, but putting maybe less agenda items per agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10718.396s">And</a> then the second thing, and I've mentioned this before, is staying within the realm of local issues, because bringing in national and global issues as well <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10727.978s">a</a> couple weeks back, Gaza and the embargo in Cuba, tonight talking about some of the big oil company issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10739.444s">Those</a> might touch on local issues to some extent, but I think that it also massively extends the conversation beyond the local purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10750.689s">And</a> we'll, as time goes on, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10756.092s">very</a> much track, like even if everything that was talked about here was put into effect, I think that it would still extend the conversation into the hours of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10765.854s">So</a> something that I've been focusing on on the side is just filling the communications and information void in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10774.175s">And</a> if outside of council, some of the councillors wanted to talk to me on how to better reach the public in certain ways, I'd be open to that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10782.617s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10786.441s">We're</a> gonna go- And that was two and a half minutes, by the way.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17585.796s">Patrick</a> Lurken, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17589.518s">Like</a> Councilor Tseng, I'm a man who appreciates nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17592.64s">And</a> on this particular topic, I think that it's an example of a mistake we all often make, which is comparing the best aspects of something that we support with the worst aspects of something that we don't, rather than the best and worst aspects of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17609.269s">And</a> so really what I'm addressing here is kind of the philosophy behind this rather than kind of the details of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17615.533s">And</a> I think one of the mistakes that's made with with fossil fuels and I have many many criticisms against the fossil fuel industry, and it's negative externalities, but we're comparing a mature industry with against an industry that isn't mature yet which is renewables. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17634.73s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17635.751s">Fossil</a> fuels is a fully scaled enterprise at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17638.832s">And</a> it's sort of like comparing Facebook as a startup to Facebook as a mega corporation, because we are not really aware of the externalities of scaling renewable energy yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17652.997s">We</a> don't know the externalities of scaling windmills or solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17657.219s">We</a> have small arrays of these things so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17661.06s">Everything,</a> once you scale it, has <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17664.741s">side</a> effects and has unintended consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17668.164s">So</a> windmills, for example, you have to source the materials from all across the globe through supply chains, some of which might be in fraught regions which require forever wars like oil has, some of which might require child labor to produce, some of which might have <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17689.274s">byproducts</a> that you have to accumulate in big open pits. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17693.177s">Some</a> of them might have concentrated waste products like nuclear fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17700.062s">Some</a> of them might have dispersed waste products like the CO2 emissions of fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17707.006s">So</a> when you really look at this from a systems level perspective, which we're not really used to doing, there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17716.573s">complexity</a> and a lot of nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17718.636s">And</a> I just want to remind people that while the fossil fuel companies are by no means saints, they're also not <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17730.336s">purely</a> villains either. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17731.717s">We</a> do live in a world that has been for better or worse defined by the industrial revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17737.901s">And</a> I think that fossil fuel companies just like renewables companies are improving their products all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17744.626s">And</a> so we should just keep this in mind when we put these carrots and sticks in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=17749.79s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks/2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks.html">City Council 02-06-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2720.586s">Patrick</a> clerkin 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2723.187s">I'd</a> like to start off by commending Councilors Callahan and Leming for putting this motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2728.889s">I</a> am pretty passionate about history and I have learned about the history of the Cold War and the war on drugs and how they relate to this particular issue of entheogenic and psychedelic substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2742.154s">And</a> I started really getting into this when I started noticing the trends and rises in depression and anxiety, chronic depression and anxiety, deaths of despair, the opioid crisis, as mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2759.231s">PTSD.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2760.491s">And</a> I heard about these trials that were being done at John Hopkins University, my curiosity, a lot of the people that suffered from these things saying that this was using some of these substances really psychologically healed them in a way that some of these holistically healed them in a way that some of these more kind of reductionists artificially derived substances like, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2787.217s">oxycontin</a> would not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2789.019s">And</a> so I thought to myself, if I'm going to potentially advocate for these, I want to know more about them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2796.465s">Long</a> story short, I myself ended up trying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2800.008s">I</a> tried ayahuasca several times, I tried 5-MeO-DMT psilocybin, and I come up here not to just drop that in front of everyone, but to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2811.838s">I</a> can speak personally to their possibilities and their limitations, and I would put myself forward as someone who would help you to advance this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2824.934s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2826.416s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Clerk.

 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13820.543s">Yeah,</a> if you need to find me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13823.184s">So</a> my concern with this, not to take away from any of the testimony from the Gaza issue earlier, it was powerful and it was meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13835.251s">My</a> concern is really the precedent that it sends that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13840.006s">If</a> Gaza or if Cuba are local issues, then what isn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13845.151s">You</a> know, I mean, should we be talking about the Rohingya Muslims? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13848.013s">Should</a> we be talking about the Uyghurs in China? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13849.975s">Should</a> we be talking about what's going on in Colombia and Argentina and anywhere in the world? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13855.18s">I</a> mean, in a sense, yes, but should it be here in these chambers? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13859.183s">I</a> think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13860.905s">we</a> have to start to put some structure in place where, you know, there's personal matters, there's local matters, there's state matters, there's national matters, there's global matters, and they're all important, but, and I completely agree that Medford is not this, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13881.724s">completely</a> sealed off entity it were affected by by immigration were affected by by technology changes were affected by inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13891.132s">We're</a> not her medically sealed but. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13895.967s">the</a> amount of energy that will go into fighting global issues in these chambers will pull energy away from all of these other things that truly are locally confined issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13906.85s">And</a> it's like the body needs to continue to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13909.731s">And</a> if you pump all the blood towards one organ, then all the other organs start to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13913.912s">I</a> know that's not maybe the best analogy, but it's the best analogy I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13918.793s">So</a> I just wanted to put that on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13920.974s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9634.3s">Hi,</a> Patrick Clerken, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9637.982s">A</a> lot of great comments made here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9639.943s">I</a> just wanted to add the comment that I felt like I think we've gotten significantly past this, but I think when this was first brought up by Nicole back in December, the initial argument for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9655.12s">was</a> a little bit reductionistic in the sense of bringing pay parity between council and the committee, just because I understand historically the difference between men and women and that still exists to some extent, but because the committee and the council are both mixed at this point, it's a little bit comparing apples to oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9677.807s">So</a> I wanted to request if possible, just for public edification, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9683.909s">a</a> simple diagram that compares basically what council does and what school committee does and how they should be potentially brought up to equity or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9699.72s">Is</a> it based on the hours worked overall? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9702.382s">Is</a> it based on the content of the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9704.864s">Because</a> it's not necessarily the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9710.706s">I</a> don't know for sure what, and I think probably a lot of people in Medford don't know for sure what each of these two bodies does, and so it would be difficult to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9724.11s">how</a> they could be brought up to parity or if they should be brought up to parity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9727.573s">And</a> I just want to add that just like when you're talking to people and you meet them for the first time and you hear their name and it goes in one ear and out the other, a lot of the times if we don't have these diagrams or simple ways to understand these things, when you just hear the information in a stream, it just goes right out the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9747.428s">So</a> anything <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9749.71s">with</a> this issue and with future issues, that's like a simple diagram or something that could be posted in a public place would really help. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9755.695s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Patrick Clerkin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11401.778s">Once</a> again, Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11404.099s">I</a> just wanted to be simpler with what I said before, which is it basically comes down in my eyes to, if this is a question of equal pay for equal work, you have to make sure that you're comparing equal things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11415.321s">If</a> it was comparing a school committee that was all men and a school committee that was all women that were getting different pay, that would be one thing, but you're changing multiple variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11424.104s">You're</a> comparing not just <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11427.325s">men</a> and women, mixed bodies, but you're also comparing a school committee and city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11432.749s">So</a> you either have to demonstrate that it is equal work or if it's not equal work, you have to demonstrate why there should be equal pay for an equal work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11443.377s">That's</a> basically what I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11445.098s">Thank</a> you.
