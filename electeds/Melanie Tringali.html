 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=312.088s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=312.648s">Mistakes</a> happen.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2426.652s">Hi,</a> I'm Melanie Tringali. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2428.472s">I</a> don't know how I'm going to top that, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2430.053s">But</a> anyways, first of all, I want to thank the Medford Democrat City Committee for organizing this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2437.954s">I'm</a> a longtime resident of Medford and a homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2440.854s">My</a> husband, James Murdoch, and I live on Forest Street with our four children. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2445.235s">Both</a> my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2449.636s">My</a> father, Salvatore J. Tringali, lived in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2453.557s">And</a> my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2456.697s">I'm</a> a graduate of UMass Amherst, and have over 20 years of business experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2461.739s">As</a> long as I have lived here, I have served this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2464.92s">I</a> served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, and served on the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2474.823s">Today,</a> I'm a board member of the Rotary Club, an organization that provides services to the city and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2483.608s">I'm</a> running because this is my home and a city I deeply love. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2487.49s">I</a> want to serve this community, make a positive impact, and ensure Medford is the best it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2493.963s">I</a> believe in common sense change, the kind that strengthens neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the history and character of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2501.867s">As</a> a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but given the time tonight, let me highlight my top four priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2508.871s">One,</a> I will always protect our neighborhoods and historic squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2512.813s">Blanket</a> rezoning would forever change our neighborhoods and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2516.835s">Instead,</a> we should focus on thoughtful commercial development that grows our tax base and revitalizes our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2523.358s">Two,</a> our streets and sidewalks continue to be in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2527.743s">Recent</a> staffing changes and overrides have not made significant improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2532.388s">Potholes</a> remain and sidewalks are unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2536.072s">Safe,</a> walkable sidewalks and well-maintained streets are basic services that meet the needs of every citizen in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2544.375s">Our</a> first responders risk their lives every day to keep us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2548.777s">They</a> deserve to be fully staffed, have safe and clean facilities, and the equipment to do their jobs well. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2555.439s">Public</a> safety must come first in our city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2558.821s">And</a> fourth, <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2559.981s">For</a> the fourth year in a row, Medford has had a large amount of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2563.883s">The</a> percentage of that free cash exceeds most cities our size of what is considered to be a normal percent of budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2571.266s">I</a> will push for line item budget breakdown and responsible planning so taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2579.369s">In</a> closing, Medford deserves a City Council that puts Medford first. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2583.631s">Protecting</a> our neighborhoods, fixing our streets and sidewalks, supporting our first responders, and spending responsibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2590.194s">As</a> an independent candidate, I will bring balance, common sense, and accountability to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2596.056s">On</a> Tuesday, September 16th, I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2602.219s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-16_76AnRcU6pIg/2025-07-16_76AnRcU6pIg.html">Medford Happenings w/ Melanie Tringali</a></h2>
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=76.208s">Well,</a> on a personal level, I'm married to James Murdock, my husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=80.99s">We</a> have four children and one dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=83.771s">We've</a> been residing in Medford close to 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=88.273s">Yeah,</a> and I have deep roots in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=92.357s">Both</a> my grandparents lived here, one in South Medford, one on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=97.121s">Both</a> my parents graduated Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=100.023s">And</a> ironically, I live now in the house of my pediatrician, Dr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=106.248s">So</a> many people that live here know that old yellow house on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=112.514s">And</a> on a professional level, I work in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=116.118s">I've</a> been in marketing for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=118.941s">I've</a> worked for professional services company, nonprofits, education, and community service-wise, I've been on the Methodist Family Network Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=129.774s">I've</a> worked â€“ I was on the <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=132.82s">I</a> was the co-chair of the PTO for the Columbus School, which is now the Mississippi, but when I was at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=140.424s">And</a> I am now a member of Method Rotary.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=181.085s">Well,</a> one, the thing I learned is I really enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=186.526s">It</a> was a lot of hard work, I'm not going to lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=189.222s">But</a> I really enjoyed meeting people, being out in the community, hearing from different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=195.026s">But</a> then the other lesson I learned is that it's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=197.988s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=199.389s">It</a> takes a lot of time and effort from meeting people to fundraising, trying to get up to speed and everything that's happening with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=208.515s">But</a> overall, it was a good experience.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=235.312s">The</a> biggest issue right now is the rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=238.248s">And</a> I am really rezoning in a way that disrupts our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=245.292s">And</a> so we really need to take a step back and protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=249.034s">That's</a> my first thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=250.935s">I</a> am not against rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=253.276s">I</a> think we need to rezone at a level that brings in a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=258.487s">And</a> not so much this type of this rezoning that's happening is really trying to bring in a lot of density. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=264.18s">And</a> I don't know if housing density is the right thing for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=267.607s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=269.325s">for</a> this city to be successful and to grow is we need to think of rezoning in a way that brings in commercial and more businesses so that we're not relying on residential tax bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=283.095s">Because</a> if we continue to rely on residential tax bases, we'll continue to have more overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=289.76s">So</a> that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=290.761s">I</a> think other than that, the majority of the issues are still there.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=295.945s">Most</a> of them, not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=298.307s">You</a> know, my campaign when I ran two years ago, my campaign was running on the local issues and not on the national issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=305.812s">I</a> think we need to take a step back and really look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=310.556s">we</a> function as a city and making sure that we still have problems with our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=315.928s">We</a> still have problems with our streets and our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=319.015s">There's</a> still <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=322.797s">I</a> would say budgetary issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=323.998s">We</a> still come up with $25 million of free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=327.24s">So</a> why is that continuing to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=332.042s">That's</a> not to say we shouldn't have a rainy day fund, but $25 million is a lot of money to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=335.844s">Sure</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=339.386s">Revitalizing</a> our squares, bringing in more of a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=342.348s">So</a> a lot of that stuff is still kind of the same.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=346.17s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=347.29s">But</a> the main thing right now, I think, is really protecting our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=352.837s">This</a> rezoning fundamentally changes the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=357.7s">And</a> it fundamentally changes every single neighborhood we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=362.083s">I've</a> been living here for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=364.605s">And</a> one thing I've always appreciated about the city is the difference between Lawrence Estates, West Medford, East Medford, Glenwood, the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=374.532s">Every</a> place is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=376.513s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=377.774s">And</a> what we're seeing is people coming in and making them kind of look <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=382.817s">Vanilla</a> and taking away Taking that away.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=402.371s">Yeah,</a> I also don't think just by building more houses, we're going to reduce the cost of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=408.054s">It's</a> very expensive to build homes today. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=411.036s">And</a> given the green initiatives that they want, that actually increases the cost of building houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=419.701s">And</a> no one's not going to build houses without a profit.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=425.984s">Will</a> it bring down some costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=428.286s">Maybe,</a> but not drastically.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=453.364s">There</a> was a lot of problems.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=459.351s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=460.772s">Well,</a> in 2023, during the local election, there were a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=467.699s">And</a> I think a lot of those problems came to fruition or were recognized when the tallies and the results of the election was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=479.51s">It</a> almost looked like there was <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=481.555s">counts</a> or ballots missing because the tallies weren't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=486.716s">But</a> some of the main issues, and I'm going to have to refer to my notes on this one because there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=492.537s">So</a> one, there was misprinting of ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=494.378s">They</a> sent out incorrect ballots, the mail-in ballots, and they were wrong.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=507.423s">I</a> believe there was incorrect information on the website at one point with incorrect dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=512.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=513.129s">There</a> was inaccurate instructions provided to the voter polls and mail-in ballots, if memory serves me right.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=521.337s">Trainings</a> that were provided had incorrect information. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=525.14s">People</a> were told, the poll wardens were telling people they couldn't bring in notes or instructions about who they wanted to vote for, and they were turning people away. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=533.746s">I</a> know there was many people that went to vote, and they weren't on the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=539.089s">They</a> somehow, even though they filled out a census, they weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=542.771s">There</a> was an issue with the poll location. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=544.713s">I</a> believe there was an issue with the Roberts School, and one of the poll locations had changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=552.905s">There</a> was definitely an issue with the ballot counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=556.086s">And</a> when the results were provided, you could tell there was, it looked like there was 700 votes missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=565.37s">So</a> giving all, and actually, for on the record, the city council recognized all these issues and actually agreed, they all voted, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=582.099s">Every</a> single one of them agreed that the issues were bad and that they were to write a letter to the Secretary of State asking them to come in and review the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=590.684s">That's</a> how bad it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=591.524s">So</a> it was a mess, the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=593.045s">Yeah,</a> it was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=594.426s">So</a> I knew I didn't win. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=596.867s">I</a> was definitely behind by a couple of hundred votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=600.629s">But</a> I felt it was important to develop or I felt it important to do a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=606.977s">And</a> the reason I wanted to do the recount, because I wanted to see if there was any other inconsistencies, given all the stuff leading up to the election and the ballot count. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=616.266s">And</a> there was.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=618.028s">There</a> was a lot of inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=620.67s">The</a> things that we found were that there was 130 mail-in ballots that were never counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=627.585s">Now,</a> people say, oh, 130, that's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.065s">But</a> it is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.705s">That's</a> someone's vote that was not counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=633.026s">And</a> that goes to show that there's still process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=635.867s">There's</a> problems with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=639.928s">Then</a> for precinct counting, 80% of the precincts had incorrect tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=649.089s">So</a> what we did is we counted the ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=652.762s">And</a> then we compare the ballots to the tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=654.664s">And</a> what we found were, in some cases, there was more tallies than there were ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=662.252s">And</a> actually in two of them, two precincts, there was 40 more <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=668.301s">I</a> mean, all of them had some inconsistencies, but two of them, one was 40 more and one was 50 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=672.847s">So</a> we had 50 more tallies than actual ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=675.911s">So,</a> yeah, there were a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=678.834s">And,</a> you know, I don't know if those got resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=681.277s">You</a> know, the city council had requested that the elections committee come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=687.169s">With</a> the report, I went to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=689.109s">I</a> don't know if anything was actually resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=691.51s">In</a> matter of fact, in 2024, during the federal election, and during the override, I was out one night with a friend, and I said, let's just go over to the, it's eight o'clock, let's go over to City Hall, and let's go watch them tally up the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=709.394s">And</a> usually the votes are tallied in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=711.694s">Chambers,</a> they have to be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=712.855s">So</a> we go up to chambers, there's no one there.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=716.011s">So</a> I go downstairs to the election office, the Italian in the election office.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=721.856s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=723.598s">I</a> actually went and asked to go and view the Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=729.784s">And</a> I was told that I could not stand in the election office, that I had to leave and stand outside in the hallway and watch through the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=739.357s">Legally,</a> I have the right to watch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=742.841s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=743.202s">And</a> I'm not, I wasn't going to harass, but as a citizen and knowing all the inconsistencies that happened in 2023, I did have the right to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=752.373s">So</a> I, you know, with the upcoming election, I think one of my main things is to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=758.54s">There's</a> a new manager of the elections office and make sure that the processes, I'm actually going to bring something forward to the city council to make sure that that happens.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=780.81s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=781.811s">People</a> want to know that their vote was counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=783.531s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=801.141s">And</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=804.26s">Again,</a> I didn't do it because I thought that it was gonna change the outcome of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=808.361s">I</a> did it to make sure that moving forward, people would have confidence that their votes were being counted.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=844.402s">The</a> only thing I think I need to do different really is really look at where I was strong in the voting process and hitting the areas where I may have not been as strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=856.371s">Reaching</a> out to more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=858.353s">I</a> think being less shy about asking help because it's a lot of work and you need the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=866.058s">Even</a> if it's just holding a sign for a day or having a meet and greet at your house so you can meet other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=874.572s">Living</a> here, you think you know a lot of people, and then you realize it's a pretty big, it's a small city, but it's a big city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=881.681s">So</a> though I do know a lot of people, and sometimes I think, oh, I didn't realize I knew that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=886.527s">At</a> the same time, I meet new people every time that I never met before.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=898.671s">So</a> yeah, I'm hoping to get another, I think I came in at 4,800 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=903.253s">My</a> goal is to get another 1,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=904.734s">So</a> my goal is 6,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=905.314s">I</a> think if I can get 6,000, I can get in.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=936.034s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=939.655s">I</a> think the biggest issue was communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=945.0s">You</a> know, I'm a marketing professional, that's what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=947.221s">Communication,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=949.543s">And</a> one thing I realized in my role as a marketing professional is everyone digests information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=957.268s">Some</a> people are on social media, some people go and look for the information, some people rely on, well they used to rely on the newspaper, we don't have a newspaper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=966.013s">Not</a> everyone's on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=968.435s">And</a> even on social media people, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=971.016s">consume</a> information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=972.537s">Some</a> people go to Instagram, some people go to Facebook, some people go to TikTok, some people go to Reddit, some people look at online newspapers, some, you know, there's just different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=985.844s">And</a> I don't think we do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=989.606s">Let's</a> take the zoning, for example.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=993.229s">Okay,</a> let's take the zoning as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=995.071s">So</a> one, we don't communicate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=997.674s">Two,</a> it's hard to find information and the information when you find it is not easily digestible. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1003.458s">And</a> what I mean by that is the zoning is a really good example of bad communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1009.501s">I've</a> been involved in the zoning since they started on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1012.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1013.383s">There</a> was little information about the Salem Street zoning in what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1019.306s">There</a> was no notices that I know of that was put in tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1022.288s">And</a> matter of fact, I know it's not because I do own a property that was part of the rezoning piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1027.31s">And</a> I'm going to be up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1028.211s">I</a> do want to to <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1030.572s">two-family</a> on Park Street that is right on the corner of Salem and Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1038.715s">And</a> I never got notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1040.095s">The</a> only reason I found out about it is due to Sheryl Rodriguez and Gene Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1044.317s">And</a> I got involved in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1046.697s">And</a> in the sense that I was going to the meetings, I was presenting my thoughts and my feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1055.832s">What</a> happened over there is really too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1060.033s">That</a> zoning was pushed through without any planning, with resident feedback, but that resident feedback really wasn't taken into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1071.176s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1073.016s">And</a> then what I mean by easily digestible is that unless you're an architect, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1080.147s">or</a> some zoning person, trying to read all this information is very challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1085.73s">If</a> you have a full-time job, trying to do this is really challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1092.474s">And</a> I mean, I'm still trying to get caught up on everything and what the zoning means. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1099.198s">So</a> it's not in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1101.279s">I</a> know I've been to community development board meetings where even the board members have asked for easy <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1110.253s">easy</a> keys and easy ways to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.095s">Simplify</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.735s">There's</a> got to be a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1115.496s">The</a> information was not always available timely before meetings to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1119.058s">And</a> there was a couple of meetings that I went to that the presentations were not up on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1123.92s">And</a> then I think the other thing is that the information is hard to find, regardless of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1127.882s">You</a> go to the Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1129.863s">I</a> mean, I was trying to look at minutes from two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1134.465s">They're</a> all on Google Docs. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1140.172s">senior,</a> I don't even want to just say senior, but if you're just not, like my husband, my husband is technically inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.316s">I'll</a> be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.896s">He</a> can fix your car, he can build anything, but when it comes to technology, simple things on his phone, he's inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1156.74s">So</a> it will be a challenge for people to find the information they need and then get it in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1164.064s">That</a> being said, I do think improvements have been made over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1167.485s">The</a> website has been updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1169.065s">They</a> have been making improvements to try to get information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1173.646s">For</a> the zoning, it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1176.067s">I</a> mean, I know the mayor, there was finally stuff put in the tax things for the West Medford and Lawrence Estates, but it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1183.348s">They</a> should have started that from the very beginning, and they didn't.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1224.011s">Yeah,</a> I do think the Community Development Board I I do have a lot of respect for Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1230.093s">I</a> think she's been very I <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1233.228s">fair</a> and trying to get everyone's information and hear everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1237.311s">And</a> I have, you know, again, it's just a little, I think a lot of this stuff happened a little bit too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1246.822s">And</a> we all know at the end, it's the city council that makes the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1249.404s">They</a> can take the recommendation from the community development board, or they can not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1253.947s">And</a> that's what happened on Salem Street.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1267.396s">Well,</a> I want to be clear, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1271.639s">I</a> do think we need to rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1273.163s">I'm</a> not saying that we shouldn't rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1274.926s">I</a> think we need to focus on specific areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1278.463s">The</a> squares, I think rezoning will help to revitalize the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1282.846s">Mr.</a> Gav, the Fellsway, but it needs to be done in a thoughtful and planful manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1288.29s">And</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1289.571s">So,</a> for example, we put out three RFPs for three parcels in Medford Square before the rezoning was even done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1296.355s">Why</a> wasn't that done, why wasn't planning done together? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1300.118s">Like,</a> okay, this is our vision for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1303.728s">And</a> to include that vision, this is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1305.909s">And</a> to do that, this is the type of rezoning we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1310.149s">There</a> just needs to be a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1311.29s">And</a> I'll give another good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1313.99s">In</a> my eyes, anyways, if you look at the Felsbury where Stop and Shop is, that's a huge property. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1320.992s">And</a> if we had thought and planned out that appropriately, have you ever tried that parking lot?
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1331.578s">It's</a> the angles and where Keynes is too. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1334.081s">That</a> came in, yeah.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1340.545s">It's</a> just it needs to be planned appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1344.546s">And</a> there needs to be a master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1345.906s">And</a> there needs to be studies done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1347.847s">We</a> haven't had the studies done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1349.147s">I</a> agree with the studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1350.007s">So</a> again, and I think that we should focus on those areas, not so much on building just housing density.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1388.804s">I</a> really do think that, again, that goes back to planning and working with different departments, the Chamber of Commerce, the planning department at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1401.466s">We</a> need to look at ways to bring in new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1404.427s">I</a> don't know if there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1408.292s">regulation</a> or barriers for people starting small businesses here. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1412.674s">I</a> do know that we have 64 liquor licenses for restaurants and only 28 are being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1420.257s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1421.157s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1421.898s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1422.678s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1423.038s">I</a> think that's pretty accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1424.159s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1424.319s">It's</a> about 60 and we're only about 28 are being used.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1430.221s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1436.035s">I</a> think there's a lot of opportunity there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1438.496s">I</a> also think we need to make our squares more welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1449.06s">If</a> you look at Melrose Square, even Arlington, Winchester, a lot of the surroundings, there's conformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1459.782s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1460.082s">Very</a> much. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1462.284s">They</a> make it very welcoming, and you want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1465.306s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1466.726s">If</a> you look at Medford Square, there's no conformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1470.349s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1471.069s">I</a> know we have a sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1472.47s">The</a> sign ordinance is not followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1475.992s">You</a> need to make it welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1477.194s">You</a> need to clean them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1478.255s">And</a> there's small things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1479.677s">Clean</a> them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1480.739s">Plants,</a> flowers, more lights, working on the signs, cleaning up the windows, just making it more inviting. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1489.109s">I</a> think we go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1491.312s">And</a> there's no reason why we shouldn't be attracting <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1495.198s">restaurants</a> and small business with the Chevalier Theater.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1540.862s">For</a> the buildings, for... And they get people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1545.503s">You</a> know, I talked to the owner of the Altacuba, he's doing well.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1581.327s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1581.867s">I</a> mean, in restaurants, I mean, there's other types of businesses that we can bring into. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1584.688s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1584.928s">It's</a> just not restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1586.229s">But</a> I think we all agree that we want more restaurants.

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1663.05s">Using</a> them as much as possible.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1667.794s">I</a> mean, Tufts, you know, Tufts, I don't know if their pilot program has increased over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1672.278s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1672.578s">There's</a> other non-profits that we could be tapping into.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1706.752s">All</a> right, I would say my least favorite is food shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1713.081s">I'm</a> not a fan of the majority of the food stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1716.123s">Okay</a> in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1717.263s">Yeah,</a> I will frequent Wegmans I think they're very expensive stop-and-shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1721.506s">I</a> don't really go to it all and I will go to Whole Foods I'm usually at Trader Joe's or Market Basket I'd say that's my least favorite So I don't really yeah, I don't food shop in Medford at all And my <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1739.502s">It's</a> kind of a combo, most favorite, least favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1742.144s">I</a> walk all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1743.625s">I</a> love that we are so close to the Mystic River, which, by the way, I think we should be taking more advantage of that, which we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1751.492s">And</a> actually, the RFP for the three buildings that came in really didn't take into account how to take advantage of our waterfront, which was disappointing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1765.974s">But</a> I love walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1766.914s">I</a> walk along the river and the Mystic all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1770.316s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1770.716s">I</a> love watching the birds. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1772.317s">But</a> it's also the worst part because our sidewalks... I mean, I end up walking in the street all the time because the sidewalks are awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1781.543s">I've</a> tripped a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1782.704s">I've</a> actually fell a couple of times on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1787.618s">my</a> dog pulled me once and I fell because there was a lip in it and ended up getting black eye.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1798.201s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1798.702s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1801.603s">It</a> is embarrassing.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1826.71s">And</a> Medford Square, I don't even like walking in the square during <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1833.376s">uh...</a> on mondays yeah because the trash so our businesses put the trash out in the front of the uh... which i don't like because i'm always afraid that i'll come across some critters that i don't want to see you know you would think there would be a better way to do that because there's gotta be a better way
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1853.45s">Tons</a> of trash barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1854.311s">It</a> just doesn't look too good. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1855.251s">It</a> doesn't look good at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1856.312s">So</a> I try to avoid the square on Monday nights.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1879.456s">No,</a> there's a lot of small stuff that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1881.756s">I</a> think following through on our ordinances would be a huge help. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1887.698s">There's</a> a lot of ordinances that are not enforced, which could bring in additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1896.141s">It's</a> not going to be huge, but it could bring in additional revenue.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1923.346s">So</a> I do have a Facebook page that they can reach out to Melanie Tringali from City Council, I believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1929.97s">And</a> then I do have an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1932.328s">It's</a> Tringali, F-O-R, and that's Tringali with an I, T-R-I-N-G-A-L-I-4-F-O-R Medford at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1942.055s">And</a> I will have a website up fairly shortly.

right outside of the main square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6924.158s">And</a> I just want to, I have a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6927.6s">1,</a> I want to thank, I don't, I remember their names, but there was 2 board members that specifically talked about providing information prior to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6935.457s">Thank</a> you for that we need that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6937.42s">I</a> like Cheryl would not was not able to review the information so a lot of this, I didn't have time to really delve into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6946.833s">To</a> the acronyms, I think someone else had mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6949.876s">I</a> think that's really helpful, especially for Layman and the majority of the residents here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6956.622s">And</a> also there was a comment from one of the board members about an overall plan for each of these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6962.167s">And</a> I think that's really important as we look to how we want to zone these squares for the benefit of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6971.393s">To</a> given the timing of the information that was received tonight, I agree with page and Michael that this needs to be slowed down and that I don't think there should be moved to the city council for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6982.158s">I</a> think there's a lot of things that still need to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6987.832s">Development</a> of commercial being outside of West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6992.358s">I</a> love to walk to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6993.98s">I</a> love to go to the restaurants and the bars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6997.304s">I</a> wish there was more shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6998.686s">I'm</a> not sure that we need more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7003.131s">I</a> think we need housing, but not a ton of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7005.774s">There's</a> tons of traffic in Method Square as it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7008.117s">Adding</a> more density is only going to increase that traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7013.242s">I</a> think there's tons of people in the neighborhood that I know of that want to walk to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7018.827s">and</a> frequent businesses, small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7021.79s">And</a> I look at Melrose Square, Winchester Square, there's not a whole lot of density there, but those are very vibrant squares with small businesses, lots of restaurants, lots of activity happening, lots of coffee shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7034.181s">Winchester</a> Square, I think has three to four different coffee shops, but you don't see a lot of density there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7039.365s">And</a> they're vibrant squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7042.768s">With</a> regards to keeping historical preservation, I actually worked, was on the Historic District Commission for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7049.651s">I</a> know there was a purpose of them of making Medford Square a Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7055.574s">I</a> don't know where that is, but I'm all in favor of keeping our history and reducing <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7063.139s">destruction</a> of any of our history for that in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7066.16s">And</a> lastly, we need parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7068.902s">I</a> live on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7070.663s">When</a> there is a show here, the side streets are filled with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7074.464s">No</a> one parks at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7077.266s">No</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7078.226s">No</a>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6205.309s">Hi,</a> this is Melanie Tringali calling from 116 Forest Street, but I do own a property at 178 Park Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6214.094s">Just</a> a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6217.997s">I</a> don't think there was a traffic study done at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6221.014s">Um,</a> I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6228.522s">Properties</a> apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6232.386s">Um,</a> I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6238.312s">How</a> does this impact our water our sewer? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6241.89s">And</a> our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6247.613s">I</a> know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6252.335s">I'm</a> very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6258.717s">I</a> don't understand why that was even considered to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6264.78s">commercial</a> zoning at up to six stories next to a public school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6270.486s">If</a> you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6277.033s">And</a> if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6285.382s">I'm</a> trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6292.167s">The</a> only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6305.157s">But</a> I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6312.292s">reality,</a> there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6317.418s">If</a> they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6330.084s">Availability</a> to make more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6331.626s">A</a> lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6335.889s">So</a> that's all I have.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">I</a> don't think a lot of them do.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6346.854s">Matter</a> of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6367.972s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6368.173s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M/2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M.html">City Council 10-29-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6997.503s">Dormitory</a> and fraternity and sorority houses can be built on Mystic Ave, which I'm not quite sure how that contributes to our tax base, but then you have senior housing facilities, CDB.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7047.128s">Okay</a> so everything in bold would be a new use and then so then previously dormitory fraternity sorority was part of the old use and that's why it's still wide but okay all right exactly yeah okay that makes a little bit more sense to me thank you thank you all right on the motion to refer to community development board um do you think we should roll call<h2><a href="../2024-08-14_j7cOY__Bzdc/2024-08-14_j7cOY__Bzdc.html">City Council 08-14-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7076.56s">And</a> just one other thing, I think the other big thing comes down to enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7080.962s">enforcing</a> ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7090.971s">And</a> if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7264.458s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7270.981s">Yeah,</a> that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7274.562s">The</a> other thing I was going to mention was it's building off of, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7279.703s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli is pilot programs, working with Tufts and our other nonprofits and helping with a lot of the code enforcement and getting some restitution or help in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7292.252s">And</a> then also, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7294.164s">my</a> understanding, and I could be wrong with how I read the budget, but isn't there $25 million put aside with the fact that the mayor only wanted 10% of our full budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7304.466s">So</a> if I read that budget correctly, that means she wanted to put about 14 million aside for a rainy fund, but that's still money that's left over, no?
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7329.995s">But</a> you said October, November, November. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7332.517s">So</a> that's not that far away.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7338.582s">So</a> you guys don't have authority to ask to be sent, but you can recommend to the mayor that she make adjustments in the budget to enforce codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7347.168s">in</a> ordinances, is that correct?

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=911.312s">So</a> we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=919.352s">more</a> than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=924.214s">So,</a> that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=943.02s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4548.241s">Sure,</a> Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4552.324s">First</a> of all, I'm really sorry to hear about Bradley Street displacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4557.767s">I</a> feel for those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4559.869s">I</a> think 30 days is not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4563.011s">But</a> I'm here as a small property owner who has been extremely lucky to have very good tenants and I treat them very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4572.997s">To</a> respond to you, to respond to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4577.415s">the</a> mortgage payment for individuals, you didn't take into account the maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4583.518s">I</a> had to replace a roof that costs $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4587.039s">So</a> my mortgage payment does not stay the same for the next 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4591.942s">Insurance</a> goes up, taxes go up, water bills go up, everything goes up, and including the maintenance of that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4598.465s">So</a> we're providing a service to these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4601.746s">Second</a> of all, I always hear when there's a housing crisis, it always goes immediately to the rent to the owners who rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4609.351s">There's</a> no discussion at all about zoning or other other opportunities to help people actually become homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4615.815s">The</a> only reason I became a homeowner is because I was able to buy a multifamily home and have rent help subsidize my mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4623.62s">Instead,</a> we are selling these two-family, multi-family homes to these developers who are turning these two-family homes into $1.2 million condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4634.678s">What</a> are you doing about the zoning instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4638.061s">Instead</a> of hurting small property owners, I provide a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4641.183s">My</a> rent is comparable and is cheaper than these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4645.707s">What</a> are you doing to help people buy these units instead of having these developers come in and redo them and selling them for $1.2 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4653.993s">The</a> house on the corner of Webster Street, that single family house that was sold and subdivided, that house just sold for $1.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4663.717s">It's</a> really, there needs to be zoning laws changed here to help these people become actual homeowners and help people become small property owners to offer rentals that are reasonable to these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4675.046s">We're</a> actually good for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4677.749s">We're</a> good, not for the environment, but good for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4680.691s">So</a> it always goes to the rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4682.753s">And</a> then you want to cap rent, but I don't ever hear anyone capping the sale of a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4687.697s">I</a> mean, no one ever caps the sale of a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4694.081s">If</a> you want this government power, why don't you put a cap on the sale of the hall?<h2><a href="../2022-02-28_0SdCkR9KuqQ/2022-02-28_0SdCkR9KuqQ.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1418.142s">Hi,</a> this is Melanie Tringali from 116 Forest Street in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1423.524s">And</a> you, again, I'm going to reiterate that you have been saying that you're following the CDC guidelines all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1432.247s">Until</a> now, you're no longer following the CDC guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1435.54s">The</a> CDC came out with new guidelines based on when to mask indoors and when not to mask outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1442.425s">Masking</a> indoors is based on a number of different criteria now based on the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1446.687s">And</a> they're looking at hospitalization rates, the amount of beds that are being used and not being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1455.173s">And</a> Middlesex County right now is considered to be low risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1458.895s">And</a> according to the CDC guidelines, those are on low risk counties <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1464.76s">are</a> not required to mask indoors anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1467.703s">Even</a> those in medium risk, they don't even recommend that people mask indoors anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1473.468s">Okay,</a> even on those counties with medium risk, their recommendation is only those that are vulnerable or who have serious complications from COVID mask, no one else. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1483.517s">And</a> we're in low risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1485.739s">Secondly,</a> you said the reason you're continuing your mask mandates is due to uptick <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1490.433s">after</a> every single vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1491.934s">I</a> like to know where that data is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1493.816s">I'm</a> on the DESC website right now, and I am checking all the reported cases of positive cases after vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1505.066s">The</a> only time there was really an uptick was during the January 2022 time when there was Omicron, when there was a high number of cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1514.467s">I'm</a> looking here right now, 12-24 to 1-6-2021, four cases reported of students, one teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1522.949s">1-7</a> to 1-13, zero cases reported for students, two teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1528.11s">February</a> 2021, five students, six teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1531.571s">So</a> where is the data that there's an uptick? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1534.552s">There's</a> nowhere near going through, if I'm looking at the correct data on the DESE website, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1539.725s">in</a> an Excel document of all number of district students reported individual positive cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1545.708s">These</a> are the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1547.149s">April</a> of 2021, two students, zero teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1551.17s">All</a> the data is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1552.131s">So</a> I'm curious, what data are you basing this information on? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1559.374s">Where</a> are the upticks that you say are here? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1561.715s">Second</a> of all, out of all these numbers, what is your data based on students? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1567.86s">You</a> say you're not doing contact tracing anymore and no one else needs to mask, only the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1574.064s">Well,</a> we know the majority of students are at least risk of any serious complications and schools have never been known to be a super spreader. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1584.63s">So</a> again, I like to know where your documentation is and also the documentation that you've been tracking that mask has been preventing any <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1593.542s">and</a> preventing spread within the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1596.063s">Where's</a> your documentation on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1597.824s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_NqJnNNyD4Uw/2024-11-19_NqJnNNyD4Uw.html">City Council 02-15-22</a></h2>
