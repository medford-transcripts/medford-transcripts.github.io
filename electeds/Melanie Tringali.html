    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6912.493s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6917.476s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I live at 116 Forest Street, so I live right outside of the main square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6924.158s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I just want to, I have a couple of comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6927.6s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: 1, I want to thank, I don't, I remember their names, but there was 2 board members that specifically talked about providing information prior to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6935.457s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you for that we need that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6937.42s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I like Cheryl would not was not able to review the information so a lot of this, I didn't have time to really delve into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6946.833s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: To the acronyms, I think someone else had mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6949.876s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think that's really helpful, especially for Layman and the majority of the residents here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6956.622s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And also there was a comment from one of the board members about an overall plan for each of these squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6962.167s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I think that's really important as we look to how we want to zone these squares for the benefit of the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6971.393s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: To given the timing of the information that was received tonight, I agree with page and Michael that this needs to be slowed down and that I don't think there should be moved to the city council for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6982.158s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think there's a lot of things that still need to be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6987.832s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Development of commercial being outside of West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6992.358s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I love to walk to the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6993.98s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I love to go to the restaurants and the bars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6997.304s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I wish there was more shopping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6998.686s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm not sure that we need more density.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7003.131s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think we need housing, but not a ton of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7005.774s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's tons of traffic in Method Square as it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7008.117s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Adding more density is only going to increase that traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7013.242s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think there's tons of people in the neighborhood that I know of that want to walk to the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7018.827s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: and frequent businesses, small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7021.79s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I look at Melrose Square, Winchester Square, there's not a whole lot of density there, but those are very vibrant squares with small businesses, lots of restaurants, lots of activity happening, lots of coffee shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7034.181s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Winchester Square, I think has three to four different coffee shops, but you don't see a lot of density there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7039.365s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And they're vibrant squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7042.768s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: With regards to keeping historical preservation, I actually worked, was on the Historic District Commission for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7049.651s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I know there was a purpose of them of making Medford Square a Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7055.574s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't know where that is, but I'm all in favor of keeping our history and reducing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7063.139s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: destruction of any of our history for that in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7066.16s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And lastly, we need parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7068.902s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I live on Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7070.663s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: When there is a show here, the side streets are filled with cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7074.464s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: No one parks at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7077.266s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: No one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7078.226s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: No one parks there to visit the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7080.347s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They all park on Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7084.829s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: the residential streets and in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7087.212s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And removing parking within the square puts an onus on elderly and other people that can't walk from distances to go to the bank and to run their errands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7099.186s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7099.666s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8650.15s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, Melanie Trangali 116 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8654.535s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I also own a piece of property at the corner of Park and Salem Street, and I do want to say that I'm in favor of rezoning especially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8663.668s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: anything that increases our businesses and commercial businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8666.949s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: However, at this current zoning, I'm not in favor of right now for a number of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8673.67s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: One, just looking at the website, one of the goals that says moderately increase residential housing and ensure neighborhood compatibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8682.873s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Under the current zoning, I don't think the increase in residential housing is moderate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8688.114s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think it's much larger than moderate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8690.454s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We could be talking about possibly thousands of houses and units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8694.356s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: In top of that, none of these houses and units are affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8697.779s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's nothing saying that they're affordable, that it's going to reduce the cost of living in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8702.624s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There are currently 489 apartments listed on Zillow right now in Medford, and that has not brought down the price at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8712.053s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Parking is an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8713.674s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: As I stated, I do have a piece of property on Park and Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8716.477s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I have tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8717.318s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They all have cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8718.799s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They all need parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8720.039s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They all drive to their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8721.92s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They don't take the 101 bus or walk around in Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8725.361s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They drive to other destinations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8728.161s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Two, I think that I'm concerned of the businesses and gentrification of these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8735.963s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: All these businesses, the majority of them do not own the buildings that they're renting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8740.164s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Rents could increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8741.244s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And we saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8742.184s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We saw that with the Best Sellers Cafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8744.565s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It was displaced for years and years, came in, and then couldn't afford the rent to stay there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8749.126s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So there's a very good chance that a lot of these local businesses will be out of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8754.889s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And again, just we need to consider parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8757.35s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: If you're gonna have businesses, you need to have places to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8761.092s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8761.852s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6205.309s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, this is Melanie Tringali calling from 116 Forest Street, but I do own a property at 178 Park Street as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6214.094s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Just a couple of things that I'm concerned about specifically is traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6217.997s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't think there was a traffic study done at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6221.014s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um, I don't think there was any study done with our public safety departments at all as to how this these new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6228.522s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Properties apartments or commercial building would have an impact on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6232.386s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um, I don't think there was any infrastructure studies done as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6238.312s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: How does this impact our water our sewer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6241.89s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And our electrical, I think that area is pretty prone to black, pretty frequent blackouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6247.613s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I know in the past couple of months, they've people have lost electricity and heating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6252.335s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm very concerned about the intense zoning around the public school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6258.717s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't understand why that was even considered to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6264.78s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: commercial zoning at up to six stories next to a public school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6270.486s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: If you go down those streets, those streets are so crowded, there's parking on both sides, it's just dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6277.033s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And if you have commercial buildings, they are businesses, it's a huge safety issue for the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6285.382s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm trying to, if I had anything else, I think those are my biggest concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6292.167s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The only other thing I did want to comment on is earlier in the presentation, I think you had actually asked a specific question about, you know, businesses and if they would have to go out of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6305.157s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But I think what we have to consider here is that if these new zoning things go into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6312.292s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: reality, there is a possibility that some of those businesses may lose their business, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6317.418s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: If they don't own those buildings and there's owners that are open to more cash or other types of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6330.084s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Availability to make more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6331.626s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: A lot of those people and all those businesses could be displaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6335.889s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't think a lot of them do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6346.854s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Matter of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6367.972s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6368.173s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6957.801s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Melanie Tringali, 1164 Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6961.422s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I just have a question as I'm looking through this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6965.202s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I noticed that you have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6968.041s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: mix one, mix two, mix three, and then through all the columns you have either, yeah, like an N, which I assume stand for no, Y for yes, and then the CDB, is that because you're sending it to them to make a recommendation for that, or is that because when one of those particular parcels come up for development, it needs to go to the Community Development Board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6997.503s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Dormitory and fraternity and sorority houses can be built on Mystic Ave, which I'm not quite sure how that contributes to our tax base, but then you have senior housing facilities, CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7047.128s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Okay so everything in bold would be a new use and then so then previously dormitory fraternity sorority was part of the old use and that's why it's still wide but okay all right exactly yeah okay that makes a little bit more sense to me thank you thank you all right on the motion to refer to community development board um do you think we should roll call<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6824.657s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I just want to thank them for bringing this up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6831.865s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I have a property on Forest Street where I live and have been seeing rodent activities the first time I've seen it in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6839.394s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I also own a property that I lived in for 25 years at 2931 Stoughton Street and have never had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6846.121s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: rat issues over by the hillside, but that is becoming an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6850.643s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The Method Health Department was very responsive and coming out after my calls and people have come out and looked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6859.106s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I do just want to say two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6861.227s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: One, there's a huge health concern with rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6866.597s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: A friend of mine's actual dog got liver disease from being in touch with rat urine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6873.122s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So rat urine actually causes liver disease in animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6878.606s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6879.507s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It can also cause a lot of issues with human contact as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6883.15s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And two, you mentioned something about the trash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6887.053s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Is trash being done, because I walked through Medford Square on Monday night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6893.294s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And it is disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6895.556s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't even like walking through this square at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6898.638s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It's deplorable, the amount of trash that's not in any receptacles whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6903.901s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They're just sitting in cardboard boxes and trash bags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6908.324s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I want to be supportive of the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6910.106s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think it's really important to have the businesses there, but I also think it doesn't put our city in good light and it also attracts all types of rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7076.56s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And just one other thing, I think the other big thing comes down to enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7080.962s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: enforcing ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7090.971s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3032.498s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, this is Melanie Tringale, 116 Forest Street in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3037.663s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I also wanted to comment similar to what the previous woman has also said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3041.286s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I am a landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3042.848s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I own two multi-families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3044.729s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: My first home was a multi-family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3046.111s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I've been a landlord in Medford for over 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3049.333s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I take pride in ownership of my properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3052.336s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I upkeep them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3053.497s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I have good tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3054.658s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm a good landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3055.659s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Many of my tenants have lived in my properties for five, six, seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3060.503s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: This registry is a slippery slope and it's a policing policy of landlords and the people that end up getting punished for this are the good landlords, not the bad landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3072.812s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You said in your comments, President, that you know who the bad landlords are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3080.245s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It is a code enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3081.867s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: If you know who they are, then you can enforce the laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3084.991s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The other thing is you talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3088.376s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3089.157s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3089.698s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You said you already know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3111.451s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Okay, all right, so I didn't hear anything about single families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3114.793s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's tons of single family homes that don't enforce their codes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3117.994s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I walk the streets of Medford all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3120.275s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's no code enforcement for businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3123.317s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's trash thrown in front of their businesses, overgrowth, things are not taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3127.859s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: What are you doing about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3129.52s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Are they registered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3130.2s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Do you reach out to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3131.901s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: How are you gonna reach out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3132.882s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You talk about tax programs that you wanna reach out to us for tax programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3135.703s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's other ways to reach out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3138.084s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: do you what about the tax incentives for single family homebuyers how are you going to reach out to them are you going to have them register there's ways to reach out to these people without having to and again the people that end up getting burned with these types of things are the small property owners who actually the majority of them are pretty good landlords and they're the ones who end up bearing the brunt of these these laws that's all i have to say thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3178.4s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Well, then maybe we should start there first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5907.538s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, Melanie Trangali, 16 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5913.062s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I just have a couple of comments and questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5915.624s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: First of all, it's good to see that there's work being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5920.287s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Many of you know I actually requested a recount at the November election due to all the issues that transpired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5928.093s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And so it's good to see that this election went a lot smoother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5930.714s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There was still some hiccups, and there's still some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5934.476s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I do think that cleaning the voter rolls is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5939.858s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You're wasting money sending things to people anyways that aren't eligible to vote, and that shouldn't be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5947.561s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: A couple of things on Henry Milleran's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5951.109s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: thing here that I wanted to comment on or question on is, he talks a lot about fixing irregularities in our election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5959.193s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And in the first four, he talks about what he wants to do, but there's really no game plan on how that's going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5966.597s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So I hope to see that there's going to be some plans on how that's going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5971.58s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It talks about identifying and investigating irregularities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5974.581s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: That's great, but how is that going to be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5978.783s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Establish an independent investigation committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5981.805s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Another good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5983.366s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Secure and audit voting machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5984.947s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: How is that being done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5986.788s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: One of the things that came across during the election and during the recount is what we found was that machines were counting ballots incorrectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5994.913s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There was several machines, actually, I think about 60 to 75% of the machines had different counts than actual ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6003.058s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: and I don't see anything here in this plan addressing how that's gonna be rectified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6008.162s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The other thing that came up during the recount is there was over 130 million ballots that were never counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6014.246s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Again, there's no plan in here to rectify or count the number of actual ballots that were received and the actual number of ballots that were counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6024.133s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So I hope to see that addressed in this plan, or hope to see it addressed in some plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6030.459s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um, and then just one other comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6033.0s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I was reading another report here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6034.761s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um, I don't know if this is an error or but I mean, it is kind of true, but I think it's an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6039.842s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um, it says seven results in transparency, the counting and tabulation of votes were conducted with transparency and a lack of accuracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6047.285s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Oh, I guess that that is accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6048.925s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But then it goes on to say instilling confidence in the election outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6053.607s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You might want to that doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6057.208s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So those are my those are my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=6059.249s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2315.116s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2319.66s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm actually one of the candidates that requested the recount of the recent election, and I just want to recognize and appreciate Councilor Bears for adding those additions to the agenda this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2335.546s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think it's really important that we have integrity in our elections and that they're accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2342.708s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: In addition, I would like it noted that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2346.981s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: you know, after the election, there was a lot of discussion about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2351.984s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And though each one of these city council members agreed that there was an issue with the process, you all agreed that there was no change in the accuracy of the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2361.292s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Well, the election was not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2364.114s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2366.991s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The outcomes may have not changed, but the accuracy was not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2371.033s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We missed over 130 ballots that were not counted, which Councilor Bears had mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2378.356s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But in addition, and I think this is something that should be addressed, is that there was tabulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2383.078s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There were several precincts that had tabulations where there were more ballots counted than actually tallied than there were counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2391.762s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: In two precincts, there was 40 ballots<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2395.183s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: more that were tallied than what was actually counted during the blocking process, and there was another precinct that had 50.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2401.528s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: In addition, there were others that had smaller amounts of 11 and 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2407.514s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But that, to me, is a serious issue with the tabulation machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2411.977s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So my hope is that somehow those will be addressed as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2417.702s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2418.243s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3939.156s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, Melanie Trongali, 116 Forest Street and a recent candidate for the 2023 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3947.043s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And just sitting here, a couple of things that really stuck out at me is that there was listed probably 10 to 15 issues with the election from beginning to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3960.015s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: 4,000 ballots, if I heard George right, were not counted, were not counted in public, or don't know how they were counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3967.52s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You all said that there was a complicated process, more complicated process because of the early voting and the mail-in ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3974.885s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And each one of you said that election integrity was an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3979.829s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And given all those issues, how can you sit here and say 100% that the end result<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3986.348s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: will not be impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3987.909s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I've been in business for 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3990.471s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And whenever there is a breakdown in process, there is usually an impact on the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3997.717s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Now, I'm not saying that those changes are going to be huge to make a difference in who won and who didn't win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4002.941s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But there should be absolute 100% proof that what happened or the counts were accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4012.528s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4013.829s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7217.988s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7219.108s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I live at 116 Forestry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7221.73s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I just had a couple of questions and then maybe a couple of suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7226.714s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Councilor Bears stated that the revenue from the parking is the only revenue that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7234.574s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: fees that has the most, but I have not been able to see or find in the budget the actual amount of money that we get from parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7243.266s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I've seen the cost it is to support our parking department, which is four people, and I've seen the revenue generated from our excise taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7252.312s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: but I've not seen any breakout of revenue from our parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7256.074s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that's a question, I don't even know if we're making any money off of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7259.735s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: That was delivered to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7264.458s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7270.981s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Yeah, that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7274.562s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The other thing I was going to mention was it's building off of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7279.703s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is pilot programs, working with Tufts and our other nonprofits and helping with a lot of the code enforcement and getting some restitution or help in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7292.252s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And then also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7294.164s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: my understanding, and I could be wrong with how I read the budget, but isn't there $25 million put aside with the fact that the mayor only wanted 10% of our full budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7304.466s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So if I read that budget correctly, that means she wanted to put about 14 million aside for a rainy fund, but that's still money that's left over, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7329.995s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But you said October, November, November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7332.517s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that's not that far away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7338.582s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So you guys don't have authority to ask to be sent, but you can recommend to the mayor that she make adjustments in the budget to enforce codes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7347.168s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: in ordinances, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7360.158s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7360.559s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So then in other words, then the citizens really need to get on her in residence of Medford to ask her to really push for this, but all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7368.225s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you for answering my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7369.286s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1632.872s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I live at 116 Forest Street, and I'm all for any new retail on the square to help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1639.916s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: bring in some new energy as well as some new foot traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1644.099s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We definitely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1646.261s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So, and I think I'm very aware of spirituals and the crystals and I think it's a great thing to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13047.917s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm sure it has not been an easy year given the situation with Covid and the reduction in revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13054.139s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I do hope that the mayor and the City Council can work together and making this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13060.542s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Um budget work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13062.863s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I definitely feel for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13072.365s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I'm not for a proposition two and a half override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13078.03s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We are all, all families are struggling right now to make ends meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13082.994s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Many people are working two jobs to make ends meet and many people are going and trying to do more with a lot less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13093.122s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It's just a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13093.822s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It's just a situation that we're all currently in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13097.103s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So I do appreciate the mayor trying to look for additional funding and making additional changes to try to appease everyone and I hope that the mayor and the city council can work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13107.426s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5960.95s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Yes, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5964.192s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Just a couple of points of clarification I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5967.833s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: One, if it's really not your business or our business, then why are we writing an ordinance, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5973.816s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And number two, when you say whether child or adult, are you usurping the parental rights for that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5983.24s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So if a 12 year old child came here from another state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5987.745s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: wanting a sexual change but the parent doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5991.75s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: What is your, how is that ordinance going to deal with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5995.373s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And then my last point is, you know, some of the things you say is not, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6006.863s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Some of your words were a little bit harsh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6009.445s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm a Catholic, I'm against abortion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6011.707s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't force people not having abortion, but I do believe strong morals and values that it's wrong and that people should be counseled on those types of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6027.058s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I do think that children make decisions rashly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6031.942s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: They don't think as a parent of four children,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6035.384s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I can tell you they don't think about the consequences very often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6041.006s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And so I guess those are my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6043.527s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And then lastly, you talked about medical rights and medical freedom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6047.288s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I'm just wondering where the medical rights and medical freedom were when those that didn't want to have vaccine mandates were excluded from a lot of their activities over the past year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=6058.392s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: That's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8431.418s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, yes, this is Melanie Tringali, 1116 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8434.04s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I actually have my hand up during the diversity, equity, and inclusion presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8440.323s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So I don't know if I can ask a question now or not, but that's when I have my hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8450.249s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Well, they didn't talk to me at the end of the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8451.93s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I don't have any comments on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8452.971s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I had questions on the diversity, equity, inclusion, and that's when my hand went up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8461.328s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So then how do I get my question answered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8472.73s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Yeah, well, my comment was in the presentation, she talked about the diversity of the student body and it was an HR presentation, but there was no diversity or reporting out on the actual people that worked in the administration of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8491.169s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So it would be helpful to have that as a comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8494.292s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: When you're talking about diversity in HR, and what, what that makeup is of the host of the whole administration of the school, school, school body and administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8505.341s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Be helpful as a comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8514.468s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Oh, I didn't see that so I apologize I didn't, I don't remember seeing that so if it was there I didn't see it I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=818.202s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: forestry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=819.863s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: This is the I'm not familiar with the Fair Share Amendment Act, but so I have a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=825.406s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: How is the money being managed and diverted to the cities and towns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=831.03s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Once this once this money is collected, if this gets approved at a state level, and people are taxed 4% that money then goes into a state must mean some state account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=841.577s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So how, how is it diverted to the cities and towns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=911.312s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=919.352s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: more than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=924.214s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So, that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=943.02s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4548.241s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Sure, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4552.324s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: First of all, I'm really sorry to hear about Bradley Street displacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4557.767s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I feel for those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4559.869s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I think 30 days is not a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4563.011s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: But I'm here as a small property owner who has been extremely lucky to have very good tenants and I treat them very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4572.997s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: To respond to you, to respond to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4577.415s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: the mortgage payment for individuals, you didn't take into account the maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4583.518s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I had to replace a roof that costs $30,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4587.039s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So my mortgage payment does not stay the same for the next 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4591.942s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Insurance goes up, taxes go up, water bills go up, everything goes up, and including the maintenance of that home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4598.465s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So we're providing a service to these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4601.746s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Second of all, I always hear when there's a housing crisis, it always goes immediately to the rent to the owners who rents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4609.351s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's no discussion at all about zoning or other other opportunities to help people actually become homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4615.815s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The only reason I became a homeowner is because I was able to buy a multifamily home and have rent help subsidize my mortgage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4623.62s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Instead, we are selling these two-family, multi-family homes to these developers who are turning these two-family homes into $1.2 million condos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4634.678s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: What are you doing about the zoning instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4638.061s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Instead of hurting small property owners, I provide a service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4641.183s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: My rent is comparable and is cheaper than these units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4645.707s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: What are you doing to help people buy these units instead of having these developers come in and redo them and selling them for $1.2 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4653.993s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The house on the corner of Webster Street, that single family house that was sold and subdivided, that house just sold for $1.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4663.717s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: It's really, there needs to be zoning laws changed here to help these people become actual homeowners and help people become small property owners to offer rentals that are reasonable to these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4675.046s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We're actually good for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4677.749s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: We're good, not for the environment, but good for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4680.691s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So it always goes to the rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4682.753s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And then you want to cap rent, but I don't ever hear anyone capping the sale of a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4687.697s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I mean, no one ever caps the sale of a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4694.081s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: If you want this government power, why don't you put a cap on the sale of the hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1418.142s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Hi, this is Melanie Tringali from 116 Forest Street in Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1423.524s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And you, again, I'm going to reiterate that you have been saying that you're following the CDC guidelines all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1432.247s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Until now, you're no longer following the CDC guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1435.54s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The CDC came out with new guidelines based on when to mask indoors and when not to mask outdoors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1442.425s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Masking indoors is based on a number of different criteria now based on the CDC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1446.687s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And they're looking at hospitalization rates, the amount of beds that are being used and not being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1455.173s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And Middlesex County right now is considered to be low risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1458.895s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And according to the CDC guidelines, those are on low risk counties<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1464.76s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: are not required to mask indoors anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1467.703s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Even those in medium risk, they don't even recommend that people mask indoors anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1473.468s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Okay, even on those counties with medium risk, their recommendation is only those that are vulnerable or who have serious complications from COVID mask, no one else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1483.517s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And we're in low risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1485.739s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Secondly, you said the reason you're continuing your mask mandates is due to uptick<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1490.433s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: after every single vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1491.934s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I like to know where that data is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1493.816s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm on the DESC website right now, and I am checking all the reported cases of positive cases after vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1505.066s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: The only time there was really an uptick was during the January 2022 time when there was Omicron, when there was a high number of cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1514.467s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: I'm looking here right now, 12-24 to 1-6-2021, four cases reported of students, one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1522.949s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: 1-7 to 1-13, zero cases reported for students, two teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1528.11s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: February 2021, five students, six teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1531.571s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So where is the data that there's an uptick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1534.552s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: There's nowhere near going through, if I'm looking at the correct data on the DESE website,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1539.725s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: in an Excel document of all number of district students reported individual positive cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1545.708s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: These are the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1547.149s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: April of 2021, two students, zero teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1551.17s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: All the data is right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1552.131s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So I'm curious, what data are you basing this information on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1559.374s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Where are the upticks that you say are here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1561.715s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Second of all, out of all these numbers, what is your data based on students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1567.86s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: You say you're not doing contact tracing anymore and no one else needs to mask, only the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1574.064s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Well, we know the majority of students are at least risk of any serious complications and schools have never been known to be a super spreader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1584.63s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So again, I like to know where your documentation is and also the documentation that you've been tracking that mask has been preventing any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1593.542s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: and preventing spread within the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1596.063s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Where's your documentation on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1597.824s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1033.815s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: Thank you Melanie Trinidad and I live at 116 forestry, and I just want to work off of that the only other thing, and I don't think differences they don't clear any snow removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1042.122s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: That's a really dangerous intersection for walking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1046.586s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: And I know there's a lot of bus stops there for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1049.188s">[Melanie Tringali]</a>: So that would be the only thing I would add is they don't.<br><br>
