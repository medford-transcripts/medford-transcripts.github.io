 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1204.251s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1205.451s">So</a> thank you for having this again, having this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1210.332s">So</a> I was on the Historic District Commission for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1214.633s">I</a> am a huge believer in preserving our history in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1220.314s">I</a> actually own a home that's built in 1850 and worked tirelessly to reconstruct it and redevelop it as a single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1231.417s">I</a> believe that we should preserve our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1233.177s">We</a> have a beautiful history here in the city of Medford, and we should be preserving our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=1238.019s">That</a> being said, I do believe that there should be some incentives to make those homes into multifamily homes as long as they stay within the structure of the historic nature of the neighborhood.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2535.714s">Well,</a> that's a tough one. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2544.716s">Well,</a> I've always been talking about our streets and sidewalks, our infrastructure, and our fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2557.499s">I</a> would definitely think that we need more money in those. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2560.201s">We</a> need to be focusing on our streets and our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2564.462s">They</a> are in serious disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2567.464s">From</a> the sidewalk perspective, we have senior citizens, disabled people that find it very difficult to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2576.448s">I've</a> known several people that have fallen and fell and have hurt themselves pretty seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2583.591s">So</a> I would say that is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2585.072s">I</a> also think that the fire department needs some serious funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2589.353s">We</a> need to really need to look at what we're going to do to help them in their fire, in their fire department area. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2596.396s">So</a> I would say those two areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2598.217s">We</a> have a lot of needs and we need to figure out how we're going to support all those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=2602.479s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3660.696s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3669.48s">Thank</a> you to the Medford Democratic City Committee for hosting tonight's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3673.562s">Thank</a> you all for being here and those that are watching on TV tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3677.803s">And</a> thank you for the candidates for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3681.505s">You</a> know, running for city council is not an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3685.566s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3687.33s">And</a> we have to, it's a lot of work, so I appreciate all of you, too, in trying to serve our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3695.382s">I'm</a> running for city council because I love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3698.306s">I've</a> been living here for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3701.01s">It's</a> my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3703.826s">And</a> I feel that it needs a leadership that truly focuses on what makes Medford special. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3710.231s">My</a> campaign has really been focused on a couple of things, mostly the rezoning and protecting our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3717.097s">I've</a> been living here for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3718.658s">I</a> love my neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3719.659s">I</a> love the community that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3722.221s">I</a> want to keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3724.483s">People</a> move here for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3726.585s">They</a> move here to the neighborhoods and we need to keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3730.768s">The</a> other thing I've been focused on is our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3733.97s">We</a> know that our streets and sidewalks need to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3737.412s">The</a> sidewalks, I had to help a senior citizen the other day cross one side of Medford Square to the other side of Medford Square because she couldn't maneuver it on her own. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3747.197s">We</a> need to do that for our senior citizens and for those that are not as well physically challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3754.28s">We</a> need to support our first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3757.937s">Our</a> fire and police are important for keeping us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3762.66s">Our</a> fire department is living in quarters that are not livable and need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3770.705s">And</a> they're not fully staffed either. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3772.926s">As</a> our city grows, which it has been doing, we need to make sure that our first responders are fully staffed and supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3781.591s">We</a> need to focus on our budget, too, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3784.573s">We</a> have to have budget transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3787.978s">For</a> the past four years, we've had over $25 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3793.7s">Now,</a> free cash is really the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3795.9s">It's</a> money that you guys put in to that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3799.101s">And</a> so we need to be able to understand where our money is going and making sure that we're spending money reasonably in the way it should be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3807.784s">Unless,</a> oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/okS2_B9brgA&t=3810.564s">Thank</a> you, sorry.<h2><a href="../2025-10-20_q5q1AJYD1Gg/2025-10-20_q5q1AJYD1Gg.html">2025 Candidate Profile - City Council - Melanie Tringali</a></h2>
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=6.399s">Hi,</a> my name is Melanie Tringali, and I'm a candidate for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=11.182s">A</a> homeowner and taxpayer, my husband James Murdoch and I live on 4th Street with our four children, Michaela, Emily, Jackie, and my son Jacob, who is a junior at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=22.288s">Both</a> of my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=26.031s">My</a> father, Salvatore J. Tringali, grew up in South Medford, and my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=33.557s">I</a> am a UMass Amherst graduate and have over 20 years of business experience in operations and marketing, working for both for-profit and non-profit organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=43.365s">For</a> more than 20 years, I've volunteered with organizations throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=47.926s">I</a> served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, served on the Historic District Commission, and organized annual park cleanups. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=59.288s">Today,</a> I'm a board member of the Rotary Club, an organization that provides community service to our cities and schools, providing college scholarships, neighborhood improvements, and other initiatives such as Thanksgiving and Christmas baskets. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=73.882s">Why</a> am I running? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=75.363s">For</a> too long, I've seen our elected officials focus more on ideology and national issues rather than the local challenges right in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=83.328s">My</a> goal is to bring the focus back to Medford to strengthen our communities, support our residents, and address the issues that affect our daily lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=91.833s">We</a> need to bring common sense back to the city council, the kind that strengthens our neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the character and history of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=102.083s">As</a> a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but let me highlight my top priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=107.391s">One,</a> I will always stand up to protect our neighborhoods in historic squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=112.239s">Blanket</a> rezoning that favors high density would forever change the look and feel of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=117.693s">Instead,</a> we need thoughtful, balanced planning that focuses on revitalizing our commercial areas and main corridors, bringing new life to our business districts, expanding our tax base, and supporting responsible growth that benefits residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=133.583s">With</a> more than 1,100 new apartment units already in the pipeline, there is no need to expand residential zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=140.367s">Mevitt</a> can grow and thrive without sacrificing the character and charm of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=145.402s">Two,</a> our streets and sidewalks remain in poor condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=149.123s">Potholes,</a> uneven walkways, and crumbling pavement make daily life difficult for too many residents, specifically our seniors and physically challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=158.146s">Despite</a> budget overrides and staffing changes, little progress has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=162.647s">Safe</a> sidewalks, well-maintained streets, and reliable city facilities aren't optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=167.768s">They're</a> basic city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=169.929s">We</a> must repair what's broken now while also investing in long-term maintenance plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=175.625s">Three,</a> our police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel put their lives on the line every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=182.688s">They</a> deserve full staffing, safe facilities, and modern equipment to do their jobs effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=188.631s">Public</a> safety must come first in our city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=191.652s">We</a> need to prioritize the health and safety of those who protect us and ensure our neighborhoods remain safe for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=198.598s">Four,</a> for the fourth year in a row, Medford has carried unusually high levels of free cash reserves, a sign that we need better financial planning and accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=207.88s">I</a> will push for line-item budgets, transparent reporting, and a financial process that shows where every tax dollar goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=215.262s">We</a> also need to diversify our revenue by encouraging commercial growth, reducing over-reliance on residential taxpayers, and ensuring we're investing in projects that deliver real value for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=226.745s">And</a> five, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=228.045s">We</a> need traffic patterns that ease congestion, not create it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=232.388s">Lane</a> reductions, narrowed streets, and scattered pylons strewn across the city have only made driving more frustrating and stressful. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=240.294s">It's</a> time to bring common sense to our traffic planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=243.336s">Any</a> changes, whether it's a lane adjustment, signal timing, or street redesigns, should be well-planned and backed by real studies and data, not rushed experiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=252.382s">At</a> the same time, we must ensure clear, well-marked crosswalks and safe intersections so that walkers, cyclists and drivers can all move safely and confidently through our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=264.167s">Medford</a> residents deserve a transportation plan that works for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=268.367s">Together,</a> these priorities strengthen the foundation of our community and help make Medford the special place that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=274.493s">I'll</a> bring to City Hall an independent, fair-minded voice focused on what works for Medford, not on partisanship or politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=282.281s">My</a> decisions will always be guided by what's best for the residents and neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=286.105s">In</a> closing, Medford deserves a City Council that puts Medford first. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=289.729s">I</a> look forward to earning your support, your trust, and the opportunity to serve you and our city on November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5q1AJYD1Gg&t=296.304s">I</a> respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for City Council. <a

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=76.208s">Well,</a> on a personal level, I'm married to James Murdock, my husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=80.99s">We</a> have four children and one dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=83.771s">We've</a> been residing in Medford close to 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=88.273s">Yeah,</a> and I have deep roots in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=92.357s">Both</a> my grandparents lived here, one in South Medford, one on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=97.121s">Both</a> my parents graduated Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=100.023s">And</a> ironically, I live now in the house of my pediatrician, Dr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=106.248s">So</a> many people that live here know that old yellow house on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=112.514s">And</a> on a professional level, I work in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=116.118s">I've</a> been in marketing for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=118.941s">I've</a> worked for professional services company, nonprofits, education, and community service-wise, I've been on the Methodist Family Network Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=129.774s">I've</a> worked – I was on the <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=132.82s">I</a> was the co-chair of the PTO for the Columbus School, which is now the Mississippi, but when I was at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=140.424s">And</a> I am now a member of Method Rotary.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=181.085s">Well,</a> one, the thing I learned is I really enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=186.526s">It</a> was a lot of hard work, I'm not going to lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=189.222s">But</a> I really enjoyed meeting people, being out in the community, hearing from different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=195.026s">But</a> then the other lesson I learned is that it's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=197.988s">It's</a> a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=199.389s">It</a> takes a lot of time and effort from meeting people to fundraising, trying to get up to speed and everything that's happening with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=208.515s">But</a> overall, it was a good experience.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=235.312s">The</a> biggest issue right now is the rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=238.248s">And</a> I am really rezoning in a way that disrupts our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=245.292s">And</a> so we really need to take a step back and protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=249.034s">That's</a> my first thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=250.935s">I</a> am not against rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=253.276s">I</a> think we need to rezone at a level that brings in a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=258.487s">And</a> not so much this type of this rezoning that's happening is really trying to bring in a lot of density. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=264.18s">And</a> I don't know if housing density is the right thing for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=267.607s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=269.325s">for</a> this city to be successful and to grow is we need to think of rezoning in a way that brings in commercial and more businesses so that we're not relying on residential tax bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=283.095s">Because</a> if we continue to rely on residential tax bases, we'll continue to have more overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=289.76s">So</a> that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=290.761s">I</a> think other than that, the majority of the issues are still there.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=295.945s">Most</a> of them, not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=298.307s">You</a> know, my campaign when I ran two years ago, my campaign was running on the local issues and not on the national issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=305.812s">I</a> think we need to take a step back and really look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=310.556s">we</a> function as a city and making sure that we still have problems with our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=315.928s">We</a> still have problems with our streets and our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=319.015s">There's</a> still <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=322.797s">I</a> would say budgetary issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=323.998s">We</a> still come up with $25 million of free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=327.24s">So</a> why is that continuing to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=332.042s">That's</a> not to say we shouldn't have a rainy day fund, but $25 million is a lot of money to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=335.844s">Sure</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=339.386s">Revitalizing</a> our squares, bringing in more of a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=342.348s">So</a> a lot of that stuff is still kind of the same.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=346.17s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=347.29s">But</a> the main thing right now, I think, is really protecting our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=352.837s">This</a> rezoning fundamentally changes the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=357.7s">And</a> it fundamentally changes every single neighborhood we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=362.083s">I've</a> been living here for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=364.605s">And</a> one thing I've always appreciated about the city is the difference between Lawrence Estates, West Medford, East Medford, Glenwood, the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=374.532s">Every</a> place is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=376.513s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=377.774s">And</a> what we're seeing is people coming in and making them kind of look <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=382.817s">Vanilla</a> and taking away Taking that away.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=402.371s">Yeah,</a> I also don't think just by building more houses, we're going to reduce the cost of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=408.054s">It's</a> very expensive to build homes today. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=411.036s">And</a> given the green initiatives that they want, that actually increases the cost of building houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=419.701s">And</a> no one's not going to build houses without a profit.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=425.984s">Will</a> it bring down some costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=428.286s">Maybe,</a> but not drastically.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=453.364s">There</a> was a lot of problems.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=459.351s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=460.772s">Well,</a> in 2023, during the local election, there were a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=467.699s">And</a> I think a lot of those problems came to fruition or were recognized when the tallies and the results of the election was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=479.51s">It</a> almost looked like there was <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=481.555s">counts</a> or ballots missing because the tallies weren't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=486.716s">But</a> some of the main issues, and I'm going to have to refer to my notes on this one because there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=492.537s">So</a> one, there was misprinting of ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=494.378s">They</a> sent out incorrect ballots, the mail-in ballots, and they were wrong.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=507.423s">I</a> believe there was incorrect information on the website at one point with incorrect dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=512.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=513.129s">There</a> was inaccurate instructions provided to the voter polls and mail-in ballots, if memory serves me right.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=521.337s">Trainings</a> that were provided had incorrect information. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=525.14s">People</a> were told, the poll wardens were telling people they couldn't bring in notes or instructions about who they wanted to vote for, and they were turning people away. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=533.746s">I</a> know there was many people that went to vote, and they weren't on the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=539.089s">They</a> somehow, even though they filled out a census, they weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=542.771s">There</a> was an issue with the poll location. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=544.713s">I</a> believe there was an issue with the Roberts School, and one of the poll locations had changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=552.905s">There</a> was definitely an issue with the ballot counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=556.086s">And</a> when the results were provided, you could tell there was, it looked like there was 700 votes missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=565.37s">So</a> giving all, and actually, for on the record, the city council recognized all these issues and actually agreed, they all voted, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=582.099s">Every</a> single one of them agreed that the issues were bad and that they were to write a letter to the Secretary of State asking them to come in and review the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=590.684s">That's</a> how bad it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=591.524s">So</a> it was a mess, the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=593.045s">Yeah,</a> it was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=594.426s">So</a> I knew I didn't win. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=596.867s">I</a> was definitely behind by a couple of hundred votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=600.629s">But</a> I felt it was important to develop or I felt it important to do a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=606.977s">And</a> the reason I wanted to do the recount, because I wanted to see if there was any other inconsistencies, given all the stuff leading up to the election and the ballot count. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=616.266s">And</a> there was.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=618.028s">There</a> was a lot of inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=620.67s">The</a> things that we found were that there was 130 mail-in ballots that were never counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=627.585s">Now,</a> people say, oh, 130, that's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.065s">But</a> it is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.705s">That's</a> someone's vote that was not counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=633.026s">And</a> that goes to show that there's still process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=635.867s">There's</a> problems with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=639.928s">Then</a> for precinct counting, 80% of the precincts had incorrect tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=649.089s">So</a> what we did is we counted the ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=652.762s">And</a> then we compare the ballots to the tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=654.664s">And</a> what we found were, in some cases, there was more tallies than there were ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=662.252s">And</a> actually in two of them, two precincts, there was 40 more <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=668.301s">I</a> mean, all of them had some inconsistencies, but two of them, one was 40 more and one was 50 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=672.847s">So</a> we had 50 more tallies than actual ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=675.911s">So,</a> yeah, there were a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=678.834s">And,</a> you know, I don't know if those got resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=681.277s">You</a> know, the city council had requested that the elections committee come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=687.169s">With</a> the report, I went to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=689.109s">I</a> don't know if anything was actually resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=691.51s">In</a> matter of fact, in 2024, during the federal election, and during the override, I was out one night with a friend, and I said, let's just go over to the, it's eight o'clock, let's go over to City Hall, and let's go watch them tally up the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=709.394s">And</a> usually the votes are tallied in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=711.694s">Chambers,</a> they have to be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=712.855s">So</a> we go up to chambers, there's no one there.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=716.011s">So</a> I go downstairs to the election office, the Italian in the election office.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=721.856s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=723.598s">I</a> actually went and asked to go and view the Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=729.784s">And</a> I was told that I could not stand in the election office, that I had to leave and stand outside in the hallway and watch through the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=739.357s">Legally,</a> I have the right to watch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=742.841s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=743.202s">And</a> I'm not, I wasn't going to harass, but as a citizen and knowing all the inconsistencies that happened in 2023, I did have the right to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=752.373s">So</a> I, you know, with the upcoming election, I think one of my main things is to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=758.54s">There's</a> a new manager of the elections office and make sure that the processes, I'm actually going to bring something forward to the city council to make sure that that happens.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=780.81s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=781.811s">People</a> want to know that their vote was counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=783.531s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=801.141s">And</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=804.26s">Again,</a> I didn't do it because I thought that it was gonna change the outcome of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=808.361s">I</a> did it to make sure that moving forward, people would have confidence that their votes were being counted.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=844.402s">The</a> only thing I think I need to do different really is really look at where I was strong in the voting process and hitting the areas where I may have not been as strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=856.371s">Reaching</a> out to more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=858.353s">I</a> think being less shy about asking help because it's a lot of work and you need the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=866.058s">Even</a> if it's just holding a sign for a day or having a meet and greet at your house so you can meet other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=874.572s">Living</a> here, you think you know a lot of people, and then you realize it's a pretty big, it's a small city, but it's a big city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=881.681s">So</a> though I do know a lot of people, and sometimes I think, oh, I didn't realize I knew that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=886.527s">At</a> the same time, I meet new people every time that I never met before.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=898.671s">So</a> yeah, I'm hoping to get another, I think I came in at 4,800 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=903.253s">My</a> goal is to get another 1,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=904.734s">So</a> my goal is 6,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=905.314s">I</a> think if I can get 6,000, I can get in.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=936.034s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=939.655s">I</a> think the biggest issue was communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=945.0s">You</a> know, I'm a marketing professional, that's what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=947.221s">Communication,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=949.543s">And</a> one thing I realized in my role as a marketing professional is everyone digests information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=957.268s">Some</a> people are on social media, some people go and look for the information, some people rely on, well they used to rely on the newspaper, we don't have a newspaper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=966.013s">Not</a> everyone's on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=968.435s">And</a> even on social media people, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=971.016s">consume</a> information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=972.537s">Some</a> people go to Instagram, some people go to Facebook, some people go to TikTok, some people go to Reddit, some people look at online newspapers, some, you know, there's just different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=985.844s">And</a> I don't think we do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=989.606s">Let's</a> take the zoning, for example.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=993.229s">Okay,</a> let's take the zoning as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=995.071s">So</a> one, we don't communicate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=997.674s">Two,</a> it's hard to find information and the information when you find it is not easily digestible. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1003.458s">And</a> what I mean by that is the zoning is a really good example of bad communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1009.501s">I've</a> been involved in the zoning since they started on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1012.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1013.383s">There</a> was little information about the Salem Street zoning in what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1019.306s">There</a> was no notices that I know of that was put in tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1022.288s">And</a> matter of fact, I know it's not because I do own a property that was part of the rezoning piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1027.31s">And</a> I'm going to be up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1028.211s">I</a> do want to to <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1030.572s">two-family</a> on Park Street that is right on the corner of Salem and Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1038.715s">And</a> I never got notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1040.095s">The</a> only reason I found out about it is due to Sheryl Rodriguez and Gene Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1044.317s">And</a> I got involved in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1046.697s">And</a> in the sense that I was going to the meetings, I was presenting my thoughts and my feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1055.832s">What</a> happened over there is really too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1060.033s">That</a> zoning was pushed through without any planning, with resident feedback, but that resident feedback really wasn't taken into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1071.176s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1073.016s">And</a> then what I mean by easily digestible is that unless you're an architect, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1080.147s">or</a> some zoning person, trying to read all this information is very challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1085.73s">If</a> you have a full-time job, trying to do this is really challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1092.474s">And</a> I mean, I'm still trying to get caught up on everything and what the zoning means. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1099.198s">So</a> it's not in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1101.279s">I</a> know I've been to community development board meetings where even the board members have asked for easy <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1110.253s">easy</a> keys and easy ways to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.095s">Simplify</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.735s">There's</a> got to be a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1115.496s">The</a> information was not always available timely before meetings to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1119.058s">And</a> there was a couple of meetings that I went to that the presentations were not up on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1123.92s">And</a> then I think the other thing is that the information is hard to find, regardless of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1127.882s">You</a> go to the Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1129.863s">I</a> mean, I was trying to look at minutes from two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1134.465s">They're</a> all on Google Docs. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1140.172s">senior,</a> I don't even want to just say senior, but if you're just not, like my husband, my husband is technically inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.316s">I'll</a> be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.896s">He</a> can fix your car, he can build anything, but when it comes to technology, simple things on his phone, he's inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1156.74s">So</a> it will be a challenge for people to find the information they need and then get it in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1164.064s">That</a> being said, I do think improvements have been made over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1167.485s">The</a> website has been updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1169.065s">They</a> have been making improvements to try to get information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1173.646s">For</a> the zoning, it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1176.067s">I</a> mean, I know the mayor, there was finally stuff put in the tax things for the West Medford and Lawrence Estates, but it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1183.348s">They</a> should have started that from the very beginning, and they didn't.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1224.011s">Yeah,</a> I do think the Community Development Board I I do have a lot of respect for Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1230.093s">I</a> think she's been very I <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1233.228s">fair</a> and trying to get everyone's information and hear everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1237.311s">And</a> I have, you know, again, it's just a little, I think a lot of this stuff happened a little bit too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1246.822s">And</a> we all know at the end, it's the city council that makes the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1249.404s">They</a> can take the recommendation from the community development board, or they can not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1253.947s">And</a> that's what happened on Salem Street.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1267.396s">Well,</a> I want to be clear, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1271.639s">I</a> do think we need to rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1273.163s">I'm</a> not saying that we shouldn't rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1274.926s">I</a> think we need to focus on specific areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1278.463s">The</a> squares, I think rezoning will help to revitalize the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1282.846s">Mr.</a> Gav, the Fellsway, but it needs to be done in a thoughtful and planful manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1288.29s">And</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1289.571s">So,</a> for example, we put out three RFPs for three parcels in Medford Square before the rezoning was even done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1296.355s">Why</a> wasn't that done, why wasn't planning done together? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1300.118s">Like,</a> okay, this is our vision for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1303.728s">And</a> to include that vision, this is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1305.909s">And</a> to do that, this is the type of rezoning we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1310.149s">There</a> just needs to be a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1311.29s">And</a> I'll give another good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1313.99s">In</a> my eyes, anyways, if you look at the Felsbury where Stop and Shop is, that's a huge property. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1320.992s">And</a> if we had thought and planned out that appropriately, have you ever tried that parking lot?
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1331.578s">It's</a> the angles and where Keynes is too. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1334.081s">That</a> came in, yeah.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1340.545s">It's</a> just it needs to be planned appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1344.546s">And</a> there needs to be a master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1345.906s">And</a> there needs to be studies done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1347.847s">We</a> haven't had the studies done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1349.147s">I</a> agree with the studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1350.007s">So</a> again, and I think that we should focus on those areas, not so much on building just housing density.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1388.804s">I</a> really do think that, again, that goes back to planning and working with different departments, the Chamber of Commerce, the planning department at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1401.466s">We</a> need to look at ways to bring in new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1404.427s">I</a> don't know if there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1408.292s">regulation</a> or barriers for people starting small businesses here. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1412.674s">I</a> do know that we have 64 liquor licenses for restaurants and only 28 are being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1420.257s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1421.157s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1421.898s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1422.678s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1423.038s">I</a> think that's pretty accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1424.159s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1424.319s">It's</a> about 60 and we're only about 28 are being used.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1430.221s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1436.035s">I</a> think there's a lot of opportunity there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1438.496s">I</a> also think we need to make our squares more welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1449.06s">If</a> you look at Melrose Square, even Arlington, Winchester, a lot of the surroundings, there's conformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1459.782s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1460.082s">Very</a> much. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1462.284s">They</a> make it very welcoming, and you want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1465.306s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1466.726s">If</a> you look at Medford Square, there's no conformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1470.349s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1471.069s">I</a> know we have a sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1472.47s">The</a> sign ordinance is not followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1475.992s">You</a> need to make it welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1477.194s">You</a> need to clean them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1478.255s">And</a> there's small things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1479.677s">Clean</a> them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1480.739s">Plants,</a> flowers, more lights, working on the signs, cleaning up the windows, just making it more inviting. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1489.109s">I</a> think we go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1491.312s">And</a> there's no reason why we shouldn't be attracting <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1495.198s">restaurants</a> and small business with the Chevalier Theater.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1540.862s">For</a> the buildings, for... And they get people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1545.503s">You</a> know, I talked to the owner of the Altacuba, he's doing well.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1581.327s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1581.867s">I</a> mean, in restaurants, I mean, there's other types of businesses that we can bring into. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1584.688s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1584.928s">It's</a> just not restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1586.229s">But</a> I think we all agree that we want more restaurants.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1613.53s">Well,</a> depending on where the zoning goes, I bring in the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1617.603s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1618.003s">I</a> would really look into our infrastructure and where we stand with our roads and our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1623.787s">Uh,</a> you know, there's been a street, you know, a comprehensive street plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1628.39s">We</a> hired two new people to in the DPW or there was an override to hire two new people to fix our streets and our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1638.738s">Um,</a> really figure out where that's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1641.259s">Um,</a> take a good look at the budget and see, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1645.788s">Yeah,</a> I could see you taking a good look at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1649.032s">No,</a> I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1649.893s">You're</a> good with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1650.634s">I</a> could see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1652.556s">I</a> would look at our pilot programs, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1656.561s">Our</a> pilot programs, I don't know if we're getting the most out of them and if we're

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1667.794s">I</a> mean, Tufts, you know, Tufts, I don't know if their pilot program has increased over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1672.278s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1672.578s">There's</a> other non-profits that we could be tapping into.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1706.752s">All</a> right, I would say my least favorite is food shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1713.081s">I'm</a> not a fan of the majority of the food stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1716.123s">Okay</a> in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1717.263s">Yeah,</a> I will frequent Wegmans I think they're very expensive stop-and-shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1721.506s">I</a> don't really go to it all and I will go to Whole Foods I'm usually at Trader Joe's or Market Basket I'd say that's my least favorite So I don't really yeah, I don't food shop in Medford at all And my <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1739.502s">It's</a> kind of a combo, most favorite, least favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1742.144s">I</a> walk all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1743.625s">I</a> love that we are so close to the Mystic River, which, by the way, I think we should be taking more advantage of that, which we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1751.492s">And</a> actually, the RFP for the three buildings that came in really didn't take into account how to take advantage of our waterfront, which was disappointing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1765.974s">But</a> I love walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1766.914s">I</a> walk along the river and the Mystic all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1770.316s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1770.716s">I</a> love watching the birds. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1772.317s">But</a> it's also the worst part because our sidewalks... I mean, I end up walking in the street all the time because the sidewalks are awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1781.543s">I've</a> tripped a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1782.704s">I've</a> actually fell a couple of times on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1787.618s">my</a> dog pulled me once and I fell because there was a lip in it and ended up getting black eye.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1798.201s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1798.702s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1801.603s">It</a> is embarrassing.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1826.71s">And</a> Medford Square, I don't even like walking in the square during <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1833.376s">uh...</a> on mondays yeah because the trash so our businesses put the trash out in the front of the uh... which i don't like because i'm always afraid that i'll come across some critters that i don't want to see you know you would think there would be a better way to do that because there's gotta be a better way
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1853.45s">Tons</a> of trash barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1854.311s">It</a> just doesn't look too good. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1855.251s">It</a> doesn't look good at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1856.312s">So</a> I try to avoid the square on Monday nights.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1879.456s">No,</a> there's a lot of small stuff that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1881.756s">I</a> think following through on our ordinances would be a huge help. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1887.698s">There's</a> a lot of ordinances that are not enforced, which could bring in additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1896.141s">It's</a> not going to be huge, but it could bring in additional revenue.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1923.346s">So</a> I do have a Facebook page that they can reach out to Melanie Tringali from City Council, I believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1929.97s">And</a> then I do have an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1932.328s">It's</a> Tringali, F-O-R, and that's Tringali with an I, T-R-I-N-G-A-L-I-4-F-O-R Medford at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1942.055s">And</a> I will have a website up fairly shortly.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1954.223s">I'm</a> sure but just one more time Tringali t r i n g a li for for Medford at gmail.com awesome.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1970.61s">I</a> really enjoyed this.

right outside of the main square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6924.158s">And</a> I just want to, I have a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6927.6s">1,</a> I want to thank, I don't, I remember their names, but there was 2 board members that specifically talked about providing information prior to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6935.457s">Thank</a> you for that we need that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6937.42s">I</a> like Cheryl would not was not able to review the information so a lot of this, I didn't have time to really delve into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6946.833s">To</a> the acronyms, I think someone else had mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6949.876s">I</a> think that's really helpful, especially for Layman and the majority of the residents here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6956.622s">And</a> also there was a comment from one of the board members about an overall plan for each of these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6962.167s">And</a> I think that's really important as we look to how we want to zone these squares for the benefit of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6971.393s">To</a> given the timing of the information that was received tonight, I agree with page and Michael that this needs to be slowed down and that I don't think there should be moved to the city council for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6982.158s">I</a> think there's a lot of things that still need to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6987.832s">Development</a> of commercial being outside of West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6992.358s">I</a> love to walk to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6993.98s">I</a> love to go to the restaurants and the bars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6997.304s">I</a> wish there was more shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=6998.686s">I'm</a> not sure that we need more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7003.131s">I</a> think we need housing, but not a ton of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7005.774s">There's</a> tons of traffic in Method Square as it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7008.117s">Adding</a> more density is only going to increase that traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7013.242s">I</a> think there's tons of people in the neighborhood that I know of that want to walk to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7018.827s">and</a> frequent businesses, small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7021.79s">And</a> I look at Melrose Square, Winchester Square, there's not a whole lot of density there, but those are very vibrant squares with small businesses, lots of restaurants, lots of activity happening, lots of coffee shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7034.181s">Winchester</a> Square, I think has three to four different coffee shops, but you don't see a lot of density there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7039.365s">And</a> they're vibrant squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7042.768s">With</a> regards to keeping historical preservation, I actually worked, was on the Historic District Commission for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7049.651s">I</a> know there was a purpose of them of making Medford Square a Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7055.574s">I</a> don't know where that is, but I'm all in favor of keeping our history and reducing <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7063.139s">destruction</a> of any of our history for that in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7066.16s">And</a> lastly, we need parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7068.902s">I</a> live on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7070.663s">When</a> there is a show here, the side streets are filled with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7074.464s">No</a> one parks at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7077.266s">No</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7078.226s">No</a> one parks there to visit the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7080.347s">They</a> all park on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7084.829s">the</a> residential streets and in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7087.212s">And</a> removing parking within the square puts an onus on elderly and other people that can't walk from distances to go to the bank and to run their errands. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7099.186s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=7099.666s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6342.134s">I</a> don't think a lot of them do.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6346.854s">Matter</a> of fact, I know that, and I don't know if it's a result of the potential zoning coming up, but Citizens Bank, which is a huge bank for that community, I know I visited frequently, even though I live on Forest Street, is being closed or has already been closed because they did not renew their lease.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6367.972s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=6368.173s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M/2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M.html">City Council 10-29-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6997.503s">Dormitory</a> and fraternity and sorority houses can be built on Mystic Ave, which I'm not quite sure how that contributes to our tax base, but then you have senior housing facilities, CDB.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7047.128s">Okay</a> so everything in bold would be a new use and then so then previously dormitory fraternity sorority was part of the old use and that's why it's still wide but okay all right exactly yeah okay that makes a little bit more sense to me thank you thank you all right on the motion to refer to community development board um do you think we should roll call<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7338.582s">So</a> you guys don't have authority to ask to be sent, but you can recommend to the mayor that she make adjustments in the budget to enforce codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7347.168s">in</a> ordinances, is that correct?

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8450.249s">Well,</a> they didn't talk to me at the end of the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8451.93s">I</a> don't have any comments on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8452.971s">I</a> had questions on the diversity, equity, inclusion, and that's when my hand went up.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8461.328s">So</a> then how do I get my question answered?
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8472.73s">Yeah,</a> well, my comment was in the presentation, she talked about the diversity of the student body and it was an HR presentation, but there was no diversity or reporting out on the actual people that worked in the administration of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8491.169s">So</a> it would be helpful to have that as a comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8494.292s">When</a> you're talking about diversity in HR, and what, what that makeup is of the host of the whole administration of the school, school, school body and administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=8505.341s">Be</a> helpful as a comparison.

 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=911.312s">So</a> we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.
 <p>[Melanie Tringali]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=919.352s">more</a> than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=924.214s">So,</a> that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.
