<h2><a href="../2018-03-03_x0L4o0xiL_U/2018-03-03_x0L4o0xiL_U.html">Joe Fortunato Hour - Patriots Day Ceremonies April 18, 1995</a></h2>
 <p>[Alfred Pompeo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=359.231s">I</a> am glad my comrades, auxiliaries, friends, this morning we are participating <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=372.877s">and</a> a unique ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=375.619s">The</a> stars and stripes of our nation's banner of freedom, democracy, and courage is joined by the flag that symbolizes the sacrifice of America's prisoners of war and that of her unaccounted for heroes who remain on the roads of the missing in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=398.638s">The</a> flag raised is not a colorful flag, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=402.198s">It</a> is not an inspiring emblem. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=405.0s">It</a> was not intended to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=407.561s">Black</a> is the garb of mourners. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=411.723s">It</a> is the color of those who grieve for their lost ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=418.827s">Returned</a> POWs and all others still long for the news of those missing in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=427.792s">On</a> this somber black flag is a profiled head, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=432.8s">that</a> once was held proudly high, that once stood stalwart against the enemy, but now vowed it is the portrayal of a crestfallen captive under the watchful eye of his tower guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=450.715s">It</a> is the image of an American serviceman who has been stripped of all dignity and self-respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=458.721s">The</a> POWMIA flag <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=461.078s">is</a> a stark and haunting reminder of man's inhumanity to man and a nation's pledge that their POWs and MIAs will never be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=474.427s">To</a> submit to the enemy, to surrender in battle, is a decision arrived at when no alternative remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=484.554s">Putting</a> down one's arms when to resist is futile is to acknowledge <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=490.971s">that</a> discretion is the better part of valor. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=495.773s">Forced</a> marches, torturous interrogations, unfit living conditions, rodent-ridden camps, life-infested bodies, starvation, dysentery, disease, and death for all the companions of prisoners of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=517.303s">Life</a> in the Stalags, the German prison camps, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=521.147s">like</a> all other war prison camps, was a psychological as well as a physiological ordeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=529.069s">Coping</a> with confinement and boredom in a barbed wire compound tested one's will not to succumb to depression and self-pity. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=543.094s">While</a> incarceration was made more tolerable <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=547.84s">talking</a> about mother's home-cooked meals, many found it helpful not to be too proud to pray. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=556.946s">Survival,</a> it seems, was as much reliant on faith as on food. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=563.27s">Prisoners</a> of war knew that America would prevail against her enemies. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=568.133s">They</a> never doubted their nation's resolve to effect their liberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=573.496s">Yet,</a> while mindful that their country would not abandon them, <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=578.417s">many</a> petitioned for help from a higher authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=582.779s">And</a> to this day, they humbly confess that it was amazing grace that set them free. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=589.542s">Come</a> on in. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=591.303s">Let's</a> go over there to the fire alarm.
 <p>[Alfred Pompeo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=2469.052s">Handle</a> turkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=2469.472s">Charge</a> turkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/x0L4o0xiL_U&t=2477.236s">Rim</a> turkey.
