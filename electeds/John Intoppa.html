<h2><a href="../2025-10-16_ntWR6BrwZ7g/2025-10-16_ntWR6BrwZ7g.html">2025 Candidates Forum - School Committee - Candidates Forum - Caron Theater</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=526.237s">Hello,</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=527.278s">My</a> name is John Lewis Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=528.779s">I'm</a> a candidate for re-election to the Method School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=531.401s">I</a> just want to take a moment and just thank everyone for being here, both the people running this event and also all the candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=537.385s">I</a> think this is the first time the nine of us have been in a room together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=540.828s">And</a> I just want to thank you all for running a campaign that is based on love, that is not done through anger, that is based on what is the best for our students, faculty, and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=551.676s">And</a> I think we all have, you know, our own visions, but we all have the same end goal, and that is for the uplifted support and progress of the Medford public school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=560.789s">I'm</a> an unaffiliated progressive candidate whose vision mainly stems around student support and the co-curricular experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=567.438s">A</a> lot of my work in my day job is supporting students, whether that be for student organizations, student activities, student leadership, civic and voting engagement, military veterans and military dependents, and active duty students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=581.423s">So</a> I work a lot alongside students being successful outside the classroom, because that's what student success is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=587.065s">It's</a> the handshake between the co-curricular experience and the academics coming together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=591.867s">And</a> I'm hoping to talk about that a little bit later on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=594.828s">I'm</a> the product of public education, as I've mentioned before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=597.77s">I'm</a> the product of a K through BFA public degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=600.332s">I'm</a> a product of the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=602.874s">And</a> that is what helped me go through the system was that co-curricular experience, whether it be the athletics or the arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=612.101s">Our</a> nurses, a lot of things got me through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=615.103s">I</a> was a student with the 504, so I was very much in the nurse's office a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=618.206s">And</a> so anything I can do to support them, civic and voting engagement, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=624.07s">And</a> so I'm really here to look at how we can focus on that sense of belonging, focus on that sense of drive to keep our students in school, focused on academics, and figure out a way to make this the best time that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=635.674s">And</a> also, be perfect community members of our society, and how to be that role model for other students, whether they choose to go into higher ed, whether they choose to go into the armed forces, whether they choose to go into the workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=647.919s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1773.414s">That's</a> a really great one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1775.875s">Six</a> years ago was the first time I ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1778.276s">I</a> ran at the age of 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1779.016s">And</a> it was a lot because of these school safety concerns and mental health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1785.399s">I'm</a> the product of an unfortunate time in America where school shootings seemed to be like, oh, that happened again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1792.181s">And</a> I remember very vividly while they were doing construction down the street they would announce that they were doing controlled explosions and being in a classroom with no windows and no escape route and that being the most anxious part of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1806.63s">because</a> of that, and not knowing if this was a safe building, knowing that there was one entrance and one exit, thinking about the awfulness of that, and that severely impacted my mental health, and a few other things, and I've been very, very open about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1821.539s">I</a> think in terms of, you know, school safety, we need to look at the source. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1824.941s">I</a> want to know, you know, we've talked about or I've talked about revisiting, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1831.305s">lockdown</a> drills? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1832.246s">How</a> do we do that in a way that doesn't further traumatize our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1836.029s">How</a> do we do that in a way that our faculty and staff feel prepared for a situation where we find that middle ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1843.535s">And</a> also, you know, how, what, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1846.297s">For</a> school safety, what does a safe school look like from a faculty perspective? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1849.538s">What</a> does it look like from a student perspective? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1851.078s">And</a> what does it look like from a staff perspective? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1853.719s">My</a> background is in industrial design, and so designing experiences and systems that a bunch of users put their input into in terms of how it looks like is where we have to start in terms of, where are the pain points? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1867.522s">Where</a> do we feel like the building isn't safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1869.362s">And</a> how do we do it where we're not advocating for the ridiculous thought of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1873.563s">educators</a> carrying firearms or a bunch of metal detectors doing the building, because that's going to affect people's mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1880.025s">When</a> your building looks like a prison and feels like a prison even more than this building does, you're going to have success rates drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1886.426s">And</a> so finding that, I keep saying balance, but that balance of safety and also well-being is where we need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1893.008s">So</a> I hope I answered the question to the fullest, but thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3139.925s">Thank</a> you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3141.826s">It's</a> no surprise that, to anyone when I talk about this, but I was a huge theater kid, and this was the theater, this was actually the stage that I found my voice on, which would lead me to be here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3155.208s">And</a> obviously the stage is new and we have some new lighting, but in comparison to what every other theater production company that is at a building like this, it's abysmal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3168.712s">And</a> it's really sad because when we try to promote the arts and we try to help talk about all this, it's really bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3176.735s">Talking</a> about the vocational school too, talking about the handshake between the high school and the vocational school, there's talks of having the Curtis Tufts on the same plot of land and that integration of students being with students and being all together and working together to better each other's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3195.514s">I</a> think that, you know, kind of piggybacking on the question of what other programs would you like to see, I think we need to have a bigger, I know we need to have a bigger emphasis on design. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3205.624s">We</a> have a great graphic design program, but we have it where I feel as the community feels or some students maybe go into it where it's like, well, I just don't want to design posters all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3214.953s">That's</a> not what graphic design is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3216.714s">We're</a> doing a wayfinding survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3218.314s">We're</a> trying to figure out how to navigate the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3220.495s">Can</a> you imagine if we could do that in-house? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3222.756s">Can</a> you imagine if we had a whole plot of artists, designers, graphic designers? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3226.118s">And</a> we see that with the West Medford Open Studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3227.959s">We</a> see how powerful art and design is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3230.32s">And</a> our art studios and learning areas just aren't there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3235.322s">And</a> so I would personally be advocating for more up-to-date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3238.423s">you</a> know, technology, up-to-date resources, so that way students that choose that path can feel empowered to do that, whether they wanted to go into engineering fields or industrial design fields like myself, architecture, graphic design, communication design, whatever have you, theater arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3253.287s">There</a> are a lot of people, production companies, they're in demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3257.068s">And</a> it's exactly what we have here today, how to use DMX, how to use sound, and that's what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3262.489s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-10-07_P8rYkRI7D6M/2025-10-07_P8rYkRI7D6M.html">10.06.2026 MSC regular Meeting (In Person)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5445.236s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5448.238s">Thank</a> you for the really good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5449.399s">It's</a> actually, I was actually just at an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5451.911s">talking</a> with a parent about why don't we have plumbing and what are the differences and what's what's the deal with that so that's really cool to hear that we have pulling this away, we have a lot, and we have the means to hopefully support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5465.768s">I'm</a> really happy to see that we have chosen to go instead of the sort of eighth grade rotation and looking at stuff, we're actually going towards the ninth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5474.753s">Basically,</a> I was just gonna really reiterate the importance of going through the rotation and seeing, you know, what your options are and what everything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5481.457s">You</a> know, there's this difference between, you know, theoretical career paths and applied career paths and folks going through it and saying, well, actually, I really liked the problem solving of culinary more than I ever thought I'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5493.575s">you</a> know, this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5494.696s">So</a> seeing that, that this that's the driving factor behind that is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5501.481s">I</a> also love the ideology behind the thought of not doing a weighted with a lottery system. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5509.937s">That</a> sorry the ringing is insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5513.978s">You</a> know we talked a lot about you know we've heard from students we've heard from other folks that the vote brings a sense of belonging that actually increases retention among students you know once students are doing the things that they love and doing that sort of you know it's kind of what the CCS are. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5526.782s">pushes,</a> it is what the CCR pushes, project-based learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5529.203s">And</a> when you learn the thing that you wanna learn, your retention goes, and that drives student success. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5533.164s">And</a> so for students who maybe don't feel that sense of belonging in school, didn't feel that sense of belonging in middle school because academia, like straight path academia wasn't for them, why put that against them to be admitted into the VOC? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5545.248s">Because</a> the VOC hopefully is what will help fix that and help fix the lack of that sense of belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5553.311s">I</a> think we also, part of member Graham's point of, <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5557.197s">talking</a> about what a modern day vocational school looks like and you know the whole thing of my graduation speaker said the same thing you know they said I go to the voc I won't go to college I said I won't go to voc I won't go to college now I've been accepted to all nine colleges that I you know applied to it was accepted in you know with huge financial aid packages because the voc isn't just an end part for people it is oftentimes a stepping stone into another career path maybe they're gonna go into something else <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5581.169s">Maybe</a> they learn hey culinary is where how I got myself through high school because high school the four year first years of my life and now I'm going to go pursue something else that we don't have as a program like criminal justice like psychology like whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5592.743s">But</a> I think we also have to do an important part of advertising our programs that are. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5598.79s">maybe</a> lesser enrolled, you know, looking at we, I'm very happy to see an increase in, no surprise to, you know, graphic design and talking about how we need to look at, you know, for maybe the programs that maybe have a lesser waitlist or have lesser enrollment, you know, talking about the advantages of what graphic design is, you know, we're doing a whole wayfinding study in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5618.467s">you</a> know what a big part of wayfinding is? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5620.488s">Is</a> how it's designed and how people read through things and how people understand information, informational hierarchy, everything, zoning, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5627.893s">Everything</a> is determined by how you design the language and the graphics to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5633.456s">And</a> I don't know if we're there yet, but I'd love to see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5637.138s">And</a> business marketing being a stepping stone for any career path. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5640.26s">Whatever</a> you decide to go to, you wanna open your own business? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5642.701s">You</a> can't do that if you don't know how to market yourself or run a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5646.265s">We</a> have two people in there now, six, nine, it's going down a little bit, but these are the things that we need to be doing to push as that stepping stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5653.891s">Maybe</a> the voc is sort of like an associate's degree, pushing up whatever bachelors you go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5658.114s">But</a> if you don't do that, then that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5660.216s">One</a> or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5660.796s">So</a> that's sort of the rant that I had in terms of this, but I'm really happy to see where this is moving forward and what we're doing, transforming the vocational program in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5672.625s">So</a> really appreciate all the efforts there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5674.982s">you</a> and your staff and faculty are all, and students are all doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=5678.505s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8709.562s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8711.062s">Just</a> a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8713.263s">In</a> terms of, actually I'll go with some language questions first. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8716.924s">When</a> you, Member Reinfeld, when you say designate one member each season, what determines a season?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8799.858s">Okay,</a> I mean.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8811.802s">I</a> quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8813.002s">There's</a> quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8813.703s">Let's</a> just do quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8814.803s">If</a> it stays the same, it stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8816.924s">Doesn't</a> mean it has to change.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8828.534s">season</a> quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8829.994s">And</a> then obviously this is sort of like our policy on public engagement, presentations to the public where if they don't have anything or if they don't, like they're not being expected to prepare everything every, you know, by week to make sure that they have something.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8849.401s">And</a> they are so, cause they're behind you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8852.082s">The</a> best way for them to do that is to, I'm assuming email who?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8868.44s">And</a> then the last thing, so I guess, so I will, if there's no other questions for my colleagues, I'll motion to approve and also with the amendment of changing season to quarter and also adding, which you can sever this if you want, one alternate elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8882.613s">So</a> for the result that the school committee shall designate one member each quarter and one alternate whom the high school student council may invite to attend their meetings on a monthly basis that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8rYkRI7D6M&t=8893.302s">if</a> someone can't make it, we're still as informed as we possibly can be.<h2><a href="../2025-09-23_ewRLf8jM8M0/2025-09-23_ewRLf8jM8M0.html">09.22.2025 MSC Regular Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.183s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.983s">It's</a> no surprise to anyone that I'm super psyched about this because I was a member of student government at Medford High and then also all throughout higher education was involved with student leadership and student government and how do we advise and work to help form policy that we want to see every day that affects us every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2540.388s">And</a> it's what led me to being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2542.828s">And</a> I super appreciate the idea of expanding that and for bringing this committee back to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2548.81s">I</a> loved working with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2550.691s">two</a> years ago a lot on some things and I'm really excited to see what you bring to the table moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2555.577s">So</a> thank you very much for doing this work and I really appreciate it.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3787.134s">So</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3788.175s">Thank</a> you for all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3789.837s">So</a> we have on our agenda a policy on AI guidance and how that's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3796.834s">If</a> we vote this into the handbook, is that the same ruling? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3800.176s">Or</a> are these two different rulings for two different things? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3802.638s">Because</a> inherently, if we vote yes on this, it automatically brings it in.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3846.626s">I'm</a> asking in terms of, no, I was just more of like if they were similar because <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3851.482s">I</a> have opinions about generative AI, and I have concerns, and I have issues with it, specifically how it's being used in the handbook and in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3862.291s">And</a> I was just making sure that how we vote on the handbook doesn't affect the policy, because I get into my specifics in reviewing the full policy in the text that it's written.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.54s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.7s">Yeah,</a> because just my question was then, do I say my concerns now, or do I wait till the policy reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3904.985s">But</a> if I can just wait until the policy reading, I can more dissect it in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3910.209s">It's</a> a good question.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3929.676s">So</a> thank you for affirming that.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3953.443s">So,</a> member Intoppa, do you want to make a motion to sever the MPS AI guidance from the handbook?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3968.352s">Okay,</a> if that makes the most sense, then I'll motion to, I'll take the recommendation of Member Ruseau, motion to table the handbook discussion.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4432.682s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4433.803s">I'm</a> really happy to see this <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4436.178s">breakdown</a> and also you know the clarification in terms of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4439.28s">I</a> think one thing to make very clear and important to folks is that this is not the only basis of funding for the CCSR, that the CCSR actually, especially in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4451.907s">secondary</a> education part of the CCSR actually encourages students to get grants elsewhere and to help fund the projects through that as a way of project learning and a way for folks to learn how to do that in the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4464.151s">I</a> know that my project in the CCSR was mainly funded actually through Tufts and through Harbor Freight and that was done in with my advisor Michael Skorka teaching me how and Richard Trotta teaching me how to sort of do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4477.514s">So</a> when we see <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4480.616s">These</a> numbers outside of the scope of, well, how does that fund everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4485.198s">It's</a> important to know that at the core of the CCSR they are teaching students how to be advocates and how to advocate for themselves in terms of what they want to get funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4493.683s">So</a> oftentimes they're reaching out to community partners for sponsorships and a lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4498.646s">So</a> just kind of like a point of information, I guess, about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4502.289s">this</a> funding when we see this here and we go, well, how does 4,000 sustain the various grade levels and various intricacies of projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4509.252s">Oftentimes</a> we rely on our community partners and thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4513.234s">So</a> thank you for the clarification and I appreciate all the information presented.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4668.533s">My</a> understanding for one for the in terms of where we find what those that is actually outlined in the 10 year grant contract executed in 2021 so we'd have to refer to that language to find out what that means outside of the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4681.42s">My</a> understanding of the faculty and staff stipends when it comes to advising is more in the term of that this is the allotted amount and that it is earmarked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4693.39s">So</a> that way every, you know, and I don't know what the number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4697.174s">I</a> know I was asked to be an advisor at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4699.856s">I</a> never got to that point of asking what the stipend weeks I didn't ask ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4704.66s">that</a> I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4706.581s">But</a> as far as I'm concerned, it's a baseline stipend of whatever the amount is, and then that $29,000 is basically reachable to them because we pay part of Mr. Trotta's salary through the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4718.207s">And</a> as far as I'm concerned, it's for folks outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4720.889s">But</a> I could be completely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4722.81s">I</a> don't know the answer 100%, so I don't want to pretend like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4727.092s">But</a> that is my interpretation of this letter and from past context, working with Director Trotta on this.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4776.331s">everyone</a> else's, all the other advisors and assistants, whether it's faculty or staff, is from this, but TRADA is the only one that is paid for in our budget.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5100.747s">And</a> one more not to like you said, I'm going to make maybe a dangerous assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5106.871s">What</a> I'm assuming is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5109.578s">And</a> again, I use the word assuming strongly, is that the Cummings Foundation had guidelines on what they wanted the grant funding to be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5118.164s">And</a> now, with a lot of things happening federally with grant funding, what they're earmarked for, they are lifting certain recommendations to avoid becoming targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5130.887s">I'm</a> going to assume that they are basically saying we had priorities and now it's whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5137.45s">Because</a> that seems to be the trend that seems to be what's happening nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5142.872s">And</a> I have a feeling that it was just more of or maybe it wasn't that deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5146.433s">Maybe</a> it's nothing like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5147.453s">And</a> maybe it's just, you know, hey, we wanted to use it for this, but now <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5152.135s">you</a> know, whatever floats your boat, whatever we can do to make sure that students have student success and that they're doing the projects they want to do, and that we actually really don't care what you use it for as long as you spend it appropriately and responsibly.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.018s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.398s">I</a> want to say first and foremost, thank you member Reinfeld and everyone on the committee for putting their heads together, thinking about what this looks like, thinking about the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.006s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.587s">It</a> is very clear on a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6470.85s">There's</a> a lot of, you know, the policy is bulky in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6474.233s">There's</a> a lot of guidance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6475.654s">There's</a> some things we just can't avoid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6476.895s">It's</a> sometimes like we want to make them as short and simple as we can, but you always want to make sure things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6481.459s">There's</a> clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6484.172s">There's</a> clarity amongst other things that better less likely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6489.858s">The</a> first question I have is, has the district identified what generative AI models are state approved, are district approved, are OK to use in the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6501.426s">Because</a> it mentions that in the DESE guidelines, they have to be vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6505.108s">And</a> I was curious.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6519.318s">Yeah,</a> in terms of what, because there's thousands of models and there's different third party softwares in terms of which- Only a certain number of them have the agreement.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6535.016s">I</a> was gonna say, because that is that's my biggest concern is in terms of student data privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6540.317s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6563.865s">Yeah,</a> no, my question, it was more in terms of like, have we identified yet, you know what I mean, in terms of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6569.63s">Obviously,</a> like you said, things are fluid, things change, we find a problem with the software, we take it off the list, it happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6575.949s">I'm</a> sort of breaking this apart in terms of, so I understand in terms of citing AI sources, I find it very interesting because it basically seems like the old adage of you can't cite Google because you can't cite a Google search. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6592.353s">And</a> that's exactly what an AI citation is through MLA and APA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6595.694s">It's</a> just, you're writing what you searched up, what model you used and what day it was, which is funny because you go through primary and secondary education and they tell you not to do that with Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6605.136s">And</a> yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6606.578s">This</a> isn't our language, but this is what the language is across the nation in terms of MLA and APA, what is acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6614.12s">So</a> I think that's kind of hilarious, especially if you know how AI works in terms of machine learning that inherently it is plagiarism because it is pulling together a bunch of sources and spitting out a summary without any real citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6627.288s">And</a> if you've, you know, in college, they always teach you, even if you summarize, even if you don't use every single word, word by word, or even have two of the same, you still have to cite it because you're still using someone else's information to form your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6637.855s">And</a> so generative AI being cited is an interesting sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6643.315s">cycle</a> of like, that's an interesting kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6646.356s">In</a> terms of us implementing generative AI, I know that we as a committee stand on policies that are sustainable and making sure we're in our environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6656.519s">And</a> if you know about AI, generative AI, you know how much energy it uses and how much water it uses and how much fossil fuels it inherently uses to generate answers and to machine learn these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6668.203s">And</a> so from a sustainability standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6671.466s">not</a> that sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6673.247s">There</a> are ways for them to, I'm sure, to get the energy from solar or wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6678.171s">But</a> for the most part, it's really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6680.992s">In</a> terms of ethical usage in the arts, there is no way to ethically use AI, except for if you code an AI system and feed it only your artwork, it is inherently plagiarism and not stealing like an artist, which you and I both understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6695.242s">It</a> is more of the stealing of everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6699.845s">So</a> these are sort of some of my concerns.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6726.966s">Yeah,</a> I'm definitely pulling in from what the conversations are happening in the art world in terms of higher ed and these are the conversations we're having every single day in terms of how AI is implemented in policy in the classroom in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6740.421s">Also,</a> the part of bias and critical thinking should be checked for accuracy, bias, and misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6746.225s">For</a> me, it's at this point, what's the point then in terms of taking a shortcut to summarize these things and then have to go back and still check them to make sure they're factual and to make sure that they are appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6757.875s">And</a> then who is doing that checking? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6759.376s">And</a> I think my colleagues behind me have some opinions about that in terms of what then
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6772.258s">I</a> actually, in opposition of the policy, I think that we shouldn't be, it is my personal opinion that we really shouldn't be implementing this into the curriculum in terms of its usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6781.966s">I</a> believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6783.828s">Being</a> aware, especially in terms of literacy when we look at political and also national literacy around what is generative AI what is real and what is not I think is a very scary thing it is approaching very quickly in terms of we look at AI models that are generated from last year until this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6801.663s">So</a> I'm sort of more nitpicking this in terms of that my amendment would be to only have a literacy aspect to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6808.206s">And</a> the only times that we use this is to teach about what generative AI is, but it is not my welcoming to incorporate this into the curriculum in terms of as a tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6817.491s">I</a> understand its benefits, but I personally do not have a positive outlook on generative AI and the future that it has in terms of where it will be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6826.856s">So</a> to that, I defer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6829.201s">to</a> my colleague next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6830.642s">That's</a> not even my job, but that is my job.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6836.968s">Well,</a> at this time, there is no motion.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6839.21s">These</a> are just comments and questions.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9712.123s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to sever the AI policy from the handbook as we are currently discussing a lot of the AI possibilities in another policy and I'm afraid that they will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9725.61s">clash</a> with one another in terms of development we have with the second reading of the policy.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9741.738s">Yeah,</a> move for approval, but sever the AI policy.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3491.277s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3492.078s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R1mdipx9dPE&t=3492.879s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-28_XXXXXX00133/2025-07-28_XXXXXX00133.html">John Intoppa (School Committee)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=50.415s">For</a> sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=50.795s">Happy</a> to be here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=51.435s">So</a> my name is John Intoppa. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=52.576s">You</a> see him pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=54.456s">I</a> am a current Medford School Committee candidate running for technically free election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=63.9s">And</a> I am looking forward to continue doing all the work that we've been doing on the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=70.644s">I</a> am from North Medford, born and raised in the Heights. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=74.507s">I</a> was part of the, pretty much as many things I could get my hands on while in the Medford public schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=80.912s">I,</a> you know, was an art student, did the arts for as long as I could, athletics for as long as I could, and really had a blast sort of learning all of the community elements that popped up in both, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=96.17s">Student</a> activism and the arts and athletics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=100.457s">And</a> then after high school, I went to get my bachelor's of fine arts and industrial design at the Masters College of Art and Design, where I currently work for my quote unquote day job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=109.553s">I</a> work in the student engagement office where I deal with student activities, family and friends, orientation, student organizations, and civic engagement and veterans, veteran affairs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=122.767s">So</a> it's a, you know, dealing with people and working all the people to establish community and to really problem solve and figure things out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=130.753s">Um,</a> has been a common, uh, goal amongst my time, both in higher ed, uh, working in higher ed, being educated in higher ed and on the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=140.042s">Um,</a> so yeah, that's me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=141.844s">Um,</a> and I'm just, like I said, I'm happy to be here and happy to have a chat and conversation.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=166.925s">So</a> last time I was here, you know, I can't believe it's almost been two years already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=171.266s">I</a> talked a lot about, you know, food allergies and finding places to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=175.807s">I</a> can say that since we've last talked, I have found my favorite at the Ford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=180.05s">It</a> has been the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=183.573s">That</a> has been my go-to there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=186.396s">And</a> I'm also loving their new location, Mrs. Murphy's Pub. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=189.678s">I've</a> been loving that a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=191.079s">I</a> did fail to recognize Goldilocks, because Goldilocks is my go-to Friday place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=197.184s">They're</a> also phenomenal with allergies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=199.586s">really</a> like the they're the only specifically bagel place that I can go to safely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=205.191s">And</a> I love the staff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=206.612s">I</a> love the folks over there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=207.693s">So</a> that's kind of my Friday commute into work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=210.775s">I</a> wake up, you know, a little bit earlier just to make sure I can get there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=214.839s">But</a> otherwise, you know, the classics of I just love trying to get to as many of those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=219.638s">family-owned</a> places as much as I can because, like I said, two years ago, they employ our students and also, like, they're amazing with allergies and it's just the greatest vibe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=230.303s">I'm</a> a talker and I love having conversation and learning what they're up to and just seeing, you know, how things are going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=237.246s">Those</a> are my favorite places. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=238.106s">Also,</a> Magnificent Muffins has the best, I think, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=242.635s">local</a> business coffee that I've ever had. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=244.756s">They're</a> really good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=246.417s">I</a> don't get many of the muffins because of my allergy, but I always stop there for coffee to say hi to Joan and the gang and, you know, talk to them and see what's going on.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=299.418s">Great</a> place, though. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=300.538s">It</a> is my it's funny because you know, like I'm seeing it go from Medford electronics to then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=306.204s">So</a> my dad actually was one of the painter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=308.206s">He</a> was the painter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=308.847s">He</a> painted the interior. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=309.848s">And</a> so seeing it go from Medford electronics to what it is, and then like, they have outside seating in the back, which is also crazy to be like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=317.938s">in</a> sandwiched in between all these storefronts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=320.019s">Like</a> it feels really weird and you don't realize it until you look up and you see the brick buildings and you're like, oh, I'm in the middle of the square where I didn't think I would ever set foot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=330.046s">Yeah,</a> so that's awesome though.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=355.152s">Yeah,</a> I know it counts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=356.033s">I</a> know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=356.914s">But</a> we've been joking and you know, in the family of like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=359.716s">Oh,</a> should I put reelect stickers on the signs? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=362.339s">And</a> we're like, well, like, technically you were, but technically you weren't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=365.963s">So</a> like, I think I think the papers say candidate for renomination. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=370.567s">And</a> I like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=371.549s">That's</a> the phrase I've been using. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=372.95s">That</a> works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=373.671s">That</a> works.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=398.118s">Yeah,</a> no. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=398.698s">So</a> I, you know, it was a whirlwind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=401.519s">I</a> mean, that whole time of, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=405.412s">I</a> mean, in my personal life, it was also a kind of time I had just gotten a second contract at MassArt, so I was a contract employee actually seeking my full-time job, which I got, and at the same time was also a contract employee in the housing department as sort of an on-call support for their resident assistants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=422.05s">And</a> so at that same time, you know, I just accepted that contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=425.332s">And</a> then my phone started blowing up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=427.334s">And,</a> you know, that's when everything kind of went down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=430.836s">So</a> I really didn't have time to think it was just kind of like, we're doing it like it's happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=435.84s">And</a> that was also the time period where we had thought there was like, a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=439.499s">few</a> million dollars missing from the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=441.559s">And</a> it turns out that wasn't actually what's happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=443.36s">It</a> was a spreadsheet error. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=444.7s">And</a> we had the awful budget passing that happened that year where a lot of our folks were laid off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=452.702s">And</a> so it was really kind of this what's happening and kind of somber time to be on the committee and especially as someone who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=462.03s">you</a> know, kind of actually just came to peace with the fact that that might have been it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=467.393s">And</a> then to get thrown into it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=468.614s">And</a> that whole process, you know, I'm happy to see that the Charter Review Committee has a whole section on what happens because it wasn't in our charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=475.038s">And</a> we went off of past precedent from another, from a different version of the charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=481.542s">And</a> so, you know, there was a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=483.043s">I</a> think the thing that I love the most right off the bat <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=486.355s">were</a> the community events, and I knew that's what I was going to love. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=489.898s">You</a> know, one of the things that reasons why I ran and always I knew I wanted to be as present as I could be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=498.305s">And</a> I'm very thankful to MassArt for helping me be able to do that, because, you know, as a kid, I knew who was on the school committee because they were at events and I knew who Kathy Kreatz was and me and Miss Stone and and a bunch of others. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=513.165s">but</a> there was this thing, and maybe it was just me, but you know, there was this thing of like, this feels like I'm doing something important because these people are here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=521.628s">This</a> feels like, no matter what it is, a recital, you know, a sporting event, like this feels like a big deal because there are folks here who I view as a big deal that are here to celebrate with us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=532.812s">And</a> that feeling was something that I always wanted to give back, especially, you know, to the arts and my folks, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=541.696s">who,</a> you know, while the arts are being attacked nationwide, maybe really want that, really want that support. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=548.16s">And</a> so, you know, above all, no matter what legislation I wanted to pass, no matter my opinions, like that was something that I always wanted to do was be the present person to show up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=557.025s">And</a> I think that I've been pretty successful with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=559.307s">I'd</a> hope so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=560.807s">You</a> know, trying as many invites as I get to work with, to work with my place of employment, to figure out a way to do that and to support those folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=569.889s">And</a> so that's been something that has been my favorite thing is the community building and seeing, you know, the city rally around community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=576.752s">You</a> know, it's what I do for work too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=580.353s">And</a> so seeing the laughs and smiles and also attending events that I attended. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=586.721s">Part</a> of as a student is also surreal, like going to the fifth grade junior Olympics, like that was wild to to, you know, walk with the flag bearers and walk with them down the track with member Branley and to be that person that I saw as a kid, you know, that's been the most surreal thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=604.863s">Now</a> like in terms of legislation, I think that I didn't realize how much fun I would have writing legislation and writing policy It's been this kind of like I'm playing lawyer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=615.568s">I</a> feel like you know Councilor Tseng I'm sort of playing lawyer with things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=618.99s">I'm</a> sure it's Councilor Tseng as he finishes his begins and is in the middle of his you know a law degree but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=628.577s">You</a> know, doing that, so writing the water wellness policy, which, um, came out of a lot of the schools testing positive for lead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=636.644s">Um,</a> and you know, it wasn't just, you know, for those who may have missed that, it wasn't just the high school, which was built in the seventies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=642.67s">It</a> was the Andrews and the McGlynn all very buildings that were built when I was like three, you know, past the point of lead pipes being banned and manufacturing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=653.079s">And</a> so, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=655.107s">hungering</a> down and trying to figure out how do we prevent this going forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=657.689s">Also</a> finding out that we're now only one of three cities that have an actual policy on how water is tested. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=668.138s">And</a> we're the only one I believe that actually has numbers and says this is what happens if this number comes up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=673.743s">This</a> is when you have to do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=674.824s">This</a> is what happens if it if it tests positive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=677.286s">How</a> do you reconcile that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=678.952s">clear</a> guidance so that way no one can kind of go, I don't know what to do, because you don't want to put anyone in that situation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=684.077s">You</a> don't want to write policy and then be like, well, figure it out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=688.001s">Do</a> your job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=688.521s">Figure</a> it out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=689.002s">That's</a> the last thing you want to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=690.443s">So</a> having these sort of backup and safeguards built into it, it makes it lengthier, but you thank yourself in the long run for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=699.111s">So</a> I found this love for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=701.513s">authoring</a> policy and figuring out and dissecting policy, finding things like adding things to policy statements or looking over job descriptions and knowing from my time writing job descriptions for students, the legalities of that and going, oh, wait, we actually are not in compliance with mass state law because of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=720.044s">We</a> need to fix that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=720.944s">We</a> need to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=723.606s">And</a> so pulling in that knowledge, that's something I've really loved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=729.012s">And</a> I knew I was going to love it because that's why I would have ran. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=731.033s">I</a> didn't want to run just because I wanted the power and whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=736.456s">And</a> I wanted to be an advocate and to learn this position that I had admired so much as a kid and figure out what that was like and keep moving forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=750.503s">And</a> that's why I'm running, seeking renomination and seeking it again is because I've really loved doing it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=758.282s">I</a> love the invites, I love showing up to everything that I can and just seeing the city grow in that way, especially the children of this city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=767.671s">Just</a> seeing all the achievements they have and being able to parade

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=783.457s">I</a> had to learn a lot really quick. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=785.158s">And</a> I'm very thankful that my background as a trustee at MassArt got rid of all the Roberts rules worry. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=791.804s">Like</a> there's still some very niche things that I still have to ask about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=794.526s">And</a> you'll see me ask about it, honestly, on the floor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=796.388s">Like,</a> how do we approach this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=797.809s">What</a> do we do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=799.51s">But</a> that sort of open meeting law of Roberts rules thing being knowing that I was, I was really able to just learn or what are the rules of this specific committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=809.123s">and</a> how do we do this so that way I don't get anyone else in trouble? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=812.424s">Because</a> I would hate to get my colleagues in trouble for my rookie mistake. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=817.765s">That's</a> that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=818.205s">Sorry,</a> I didn't mean to cut you off.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=859.834s">For</a> sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=860.514s">I</a> think one of the things is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=864.694s">You</a> know, looking through our so there was actually an instance where this came up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=869.283s">I</a> think it was the last meeting we had, not like the last, like the last meeting of the school committee for this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=876.809s">Now</a> we're in recess, but it was around the MCAS policy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=882.534s">And</a> I was looking for another policy in our policy bank, and I noticed we had a whole policy around MCAS being its own graduation requirement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=890.201s">And</a> so even though we struck it from, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=894.017s">another</a> policy, like our graduation policy, there was a whole policy around MCAS. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=898.101s">And</a> so, you know, I don't know enough about law to know if that would cause a conflict, but being able to look through and understand like, oh, this may conflict, let's bring it to the floor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=906.669s">Let's</a> sort of clean up that policy bank has been something sort of fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=910.833s">But</a> on a serious note, you know, looking at, I think the number one thing or one of the number one things on my platform for reelection is voter engagement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=919.18s">and</a> voter education. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=921.081s">And</a> that is something that I think we don't have really an in-house system on how to train our students on how to be responsible, educated voters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=930.743s">And</a> my time at MassArt, I was chair of the MassArt Votes effort, which basically <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=939.055s">picks</a> up the pace where, you know, K through 12 didn't with voter engagement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=943.299s">So</a> we take the students and we get them registered to vote. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=946.082s">We</a> tell them what to do in terms of, you know, can you technically register to vote here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=951.087s">Can</a> you not? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=951.808s">What</a> does Mass State Law says? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=953.429s">What</a> does Mass State Law say? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=956.473s">And</a> so that's really one of the efforts that I think we need student input on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=959.776s">I</a> said that a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=961.137s">two</a> years ago was I'm running on we need student input. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=965.479s">And</a> what do they need, you know, I ran into issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=969.28s">And</a> I don't want to air them, you know, over the radio waves but of some but they were startling, you know, of what students didn't understand it ranged from students knowing who their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=980.07s">you</a> know, city clerk was, a register of voters was, but they couldn't get the registration to them because they didn't know how to mail a letter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=986.934s">Or,</a> you know, they thought, oh, I can early vote in Boston because I live in Boston, I'm dorming in Boston, but I'm registered to vote in Quincy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=994.259s">But</a> that says I can early vote here, so why can't I? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=997.16s">And</a> so sort of clearing that up and sort of trying to educate our students, because the way we're doing it, you know, we have a civics program in our middle schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1005.085s">But</a> what we're doing at the high school level is really some just really cool and responsible faculty members that are grabbing nomination, that are grabbing registration papers from City Hall and bringing them to class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1017.278s">And</a> I don't think it's fair to rely on our faculty to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1020.581s">I</a> think that we owe it to our students to have, you know, if we complain about low voter turnout, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1026.127s">And</a> we want to go down that road. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1029.009s">We</a> really need to make sure that we have systems in place to educate them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1033.771s">Because</a> once they go to college, if they go to an out-of-state college, what do they do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1037.613s">Do</a> they register to vote there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1039.134s">Do</a> they do late voting here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1041.535s">You</a> know, these are things really hard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1043.136s">I</a> was on my I was on the phone on election day with parents, like trying to come up with solutions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1047.618s">It</a> wants to vote, but like this is this and this is that and just trying to figure that out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1051.039s">And</a> I don't want anyone that lives in any student that lives in Medford that goes to college having to have those worries and concerns, you know, on election day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1059.624s">I</a> want them to be able to know what to do and how to vote. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1064.009s">And</a> so that's sort of one of the efforts that I really want to work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1066.711s">Cause</a> yeah, two years flies by and you know, once you have community meetings and all that, Oh, it's time for reelection.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1095.481s">Yeah,</a> so there's two. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1096.582s">There's</a> usually two. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1098.022s">So</a> the way, there's a student liaison who usually sits in on the meetings and gives input. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1103.405s">There's</a> also a student advisory council that is made up of students of all grade levels, and they meet internally at the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1110.368s">We</a> really haven't, to be honest, we really didn't meet with them that much this academic year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1113.99s">Last</a> academic year, we were meeting with them on some specific things that are escaping me at the moment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1118.793s">But</a> I remember going, because I was in the dorm, so it was definitely last academic year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1124.951s">in</a> calls with students about engagement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1127.653s">We're</a> talking about extending the school day by 15 minutes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1131.916s">And</a> we've been getting emails from students concerned about mental health concerns or other things about what will be offered for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1139.741s">And</a> so we are receiving input, but we're not meeting with them as much as I remember us doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1146.145s">And</a> I'm not sure why that is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1147.907s">I</a> don't mean, I'm not trying to air out a grievance here, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1152.212s">you</a> know, that component was missing this past academic year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1155.234s">But</a> I definitely loved meeting with them and, you know, seeing them in that spot, because I was in that spot as a student president in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1165.082s">But</a> yeah, trying to figure out, you know, working with our civics department, working with our director of marketing, working with students to figure out how can we best, you know, talk specifically about voting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1174.369s">How</a> do we push that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1175.77s">And</a> how do we get them ready for that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1177.671s">So</a> that way, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1179.164s">I</a> think we owe it to our students to get them as ready as we can for college or trades or the military, wherever they may go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1187.955s">So</a> that way, once they leave us, they feel prepared and set up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1190.859s">And</a> I don't know if we're there yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1192.241s">I</a> know I hear from. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1194.273s">What</a> I remember, I mean, I didn't learn how to write a check until I opened the business account to run for this office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1201.258s">I</a> didn't know how to open a bank account because we did it a few years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1206.002s">But</a> I didn't learn that in school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1207.082s">And</a> I didn't learn how to write a check and do this and do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1211.851s">And</a> so, you know, looking at programs like the career fair, revamping that, looking at how we can, I mean, that was great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1217.175s">That</a> was a huge reality check for renting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1219.257s">Are</a> you kidding me? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1220.218s">You</a> go around, you have a set, you get like a random job and you go around to tables and they go, Oh, you want a car or a bus pass? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1225.663s">Because</a> now you can't pay rent if you get a car, but you can't do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1228.285s">And</a> you're like, wow, this is intense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1229.466s">This</a> is scary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1230.487s">And</a> now, you know, you get to be my age 24 and you're like, Oh no, that was, that was actually, it was better than now.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1239.974s">It</a> is the game of life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1240.754s">It</a> was a big game of life in the gym. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1242.515s">And</a> that's what it was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1243.315s">And</a> local businesses came and volunteered. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1245.096s">It</a> was awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1246.456s">I</a> remember it very vividly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1247.697s">And</a> coming up with more opportunities for our students to do that, I hate to say it like this, but at MassArt, working with student government funds for the MassArt Activities Council, which are the eight students that I directly oversee, we do a lot with nothing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1263.843s">Because</a> the funds get spread around, and we try to fund as many <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1267.424s">organizations</a> they can and so that's what I find myself feeling like every time I have to problem-solve in Medford is we have to do a lot with like not a lot because we have to figure out how can we make the best out of what we have and so for that it's like voter engagement like what are we doing are we are we doing pamphlets are we doing online QR codes what do we have to do to make sure it's budget-friendly but also having the impact of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1289.507s">That</a> will change students, you know, the career fair, how can we work with local businesses to make it happen to maybe donate part of their time or donate efforts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1298.881s">You</a> know, looking for loopholes like that, because I mean for those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1303.628s">For</a> those folks who, I didn't realize this until school committee training, 80% of the budget in most school districts is personnel, and rightfully so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1312.77s">But</a> that's when people go, well, where's all this money? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1315.011s">It's</a> paying the people who are educating our students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1317.932s">80%</a> of that goes to personnel. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1320.332s">And</a> so you're dealt with 20% to do everything else. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1324.013s">And</a> so figuring out how we can do things amazing, but also set our faculty up for success, our students up for success, our administrators up for success, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1332.955s">can</a> be tricky and can be hard and you know that that's sort of what I've been trying to do is sit back and kind of look at all right where where can we do these small fixes that maybe have big impact.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1368.603s">I</a> think, you know, just keep on moving. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1370.083s">We're</a> in a really cool direction with, you know, looking at hopefully getting a new high school building, um, looking at new programs to bring into, you know, um, the schools themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1379.987s">But</a> I think, you know, those are my main big things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1382.087s">I'd</a> also love, you know, um, to see a larger emphasis and we're getting there with, I mean, we just had, we as a district just had our AP art exhibition at arts collaborative Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1394.104s">I'm</a> loving the emphasis on local artists and the local arts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1397.746s">As</a> a former, you know, board member of the West Medford Open Studios, as a practicing artist for both performing and in sculptural work, you know, empowering artists to make change is huge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1410.793s">It's</a> a completely different, you know, mindset in terms of how they approach things and really pushing our students to, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1420.138s">show</a> those off and to work when we've been making a lot of efforts to, you know, local murals. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1425.401s">And,</a> you know, I think the like the pop up the pop up space over by the senior center in Medford and Medford Square, you know, that was that was helped in part design murals were designed by the National Art Society at Medford High. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1441.069s">And</a> so, you know, really empowering artists, I think, is also a huge priority, I'd say that a lot of my priorities from two years ago are still going because I think that I know that this past year has been, you know, all right, learning all the realities and learning all the technical things and you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1457.917s">when</a> I was forming this slate, I'm like, all right, I'd love to be like, I want to create this and I want to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1462.419s">But</a> the reality is we can't afford that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1464.72s">We</a> can't do that right now, at least not in a two year span. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1468.021s">And</a> so trying to think of very specific, tangible things that we can work on has been my priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1474.343s">And</a> so bringing the arts into a lot of different areas and bringing them into different spaces, you know, maybe we do pop up galleries across which we have been doing with. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1484.407s">Oh,</a> my gosh, I'm so sorry that the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1487.4s">organization</a> is escaping me at the moment, with Arts Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1490.982s">And</a> I believe it's Arts Medford, and I'm sorry if I'm misquoting, but we had like a pop-up art walk all across the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1498.806s">And</a> doing that, you know, there were some, I believe some student artists, or maybe I'm thinking of last year, but that's a huge priority of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1507.39s">Advocating</a> for our nurses has been a huge also priority of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1510.692s">There's</a> some, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1512.82s">They</a> have had some pushback in terms of some of the policy or hiring, not hiring personnel numbers we've been giving them because of outdated practices and, you know, so continue to advocate for them to make sure that that doesn't happen again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1526.612s">And</a> that doesn't continue to happen in, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1530.046s">as</a> many budget cycles as I can say that I can be a part of.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1538.13s">So</a> there's there's a there when we were looking at the numbers, you know, there were certain, you know, full time positions that were designated for each school and designated there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1547.295s">And</a> there was talk about how that wasn't enough, because if one one nurse is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1552.72s">getting</a> an epi pen for a student or getting an inhaler for a student then they're out there you know they're off the floor there's nothing i can happen so you know god forbid something <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1561.105s">two</a> people get hurt, three people get hurt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1562.586s">There's</a> not enough nurses there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1563.647s">So</a> we have a floater that goes between buildings and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1567.33s">But</a> during public sessions, there were complaints that those were based off of outdated numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1573.474s">So</a> we, as a district, thought, oh, we're doing what the standard is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1576.636s">But</a> the position of the union and the staff was, that's not what those are the numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1581.359s">That's</a> outdated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1581.999s">We</a> need more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1583.12s">We</a> need better. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1586.26s">We</a> need better staffing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1588.241s">And</a> so, I mean, as a student who got attention deficit meds from them, you know, I saw that like, oh, I'll help you in a second. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1594.784s">There's</a> five kids in the waiting room, but they got to go help me in the back because even though I'm 18. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1599.203s">I</a> can't give myself my own meds, and I don't think people realize that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1602.426s">Or</a> they have to get the EpiPen, or they have to go get Tylenol. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1607.511s">So</a> things like that, I think, is also a huge priority of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1610.533s">But</a> still continuing to hopefully be, no, not hopefully, still continuing to be the present school community member who can show up to as many shows, or as many sport outings, or as many volunteer opportunities and give back, whether it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1625.962s">missing</a> the opportunity to help donate for a 50-50 raffle, but giving an art basket for a student, or helping sponsor a t-shirt, things like that, where it's like, all right, I can't make the event, but how can I give you money to help make sure it happens well? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1639.916s">That</a> has been something that I've also loved to do and will continue to do in my hopeful next two years on the committee.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1663.059s">I</a> think, you know, I have had an amazing time being on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1669.304s">It's</a> also been a time where, you know, we talk about, you know, darker times with budget cycles and learning the reality of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1678.577s">You</a> know, you want to give – I'm trying to think of a way to say this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1685.359s">You</a> know, making those tough decisions and having to be the one to say that and with a simple yes, saying yes, the impact that that truly has on families. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1697.519s">a</a> year ago when our budget that we passed because we were underfunded had to, you know, laid people off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1703.961s">And</a> I was like, I need people to realize that we are saying numbers, but these are people, these are bills, these are homes that could be impacted by one of us simply saying yes or no. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1714.824s">And,</a> you know, you've realized that, but when you're sitting in that chair and going to push the button, it really, really hurts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1724.107s">And</a> it really is something that, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1728.381s">I</a> didn't, voting, there's a lot of hesitation because you've realized the gravity of what you're about to say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1735.043s">And</a> I've also learned like really how much showing up matters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1738.164s">I</a> mean, I've always known showing up matters and, you know, as from the perspective of witnessing it and feeling that, you know, love from folks, whether it's my parents or my siblings or members of the school committee, but really how much people appreciate <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1756.087s">their</a> elected officials being there for them and showing that by taking time out of their day to do things that aren't, you know, their biweekly meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1765.429s">I</a> never realized how much that would impact me seeing it on the other side and how much that also did a lot for me as a person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1775.751s">But</a> I think the last two years, you know, I've always tried to lead with love and courage and just wanting to make sure that everyone has a seat at the table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1786.154s">and</a> try to approach it from a problem-solving mindset that I, as an artist, have that unique perspective of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1792.336s">And</a> it's one thing to employ artists because of what they do, but also the way they think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1798.539s">And</a> when you put artists in charge, it's like, oh, that's cool representation, but it's also a different viewpoint and a different way of thinking at the table that is really special to those folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1811.872s">I</a> think I'm talking in circles, I feel like I'm blabbing, but there's just so much, you know, it's been such a privilege and an honor to be on the committee and to see that childhood dream come to life of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1826.0s">doing</a> the work that I've wanted to do since I was in the second grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1828.702s">And</a> I wanted to abolish the MCAS, which we did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1830.883s">We</a> got rid of it as a graduation requirement because the Massachusetts voters said we could. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1835.305s">There's</a> a literal Facebook quote, I think, from my mom back when I was in the second grade of like, John wants to get on the school committee because he wants to get rid of the MCAS. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1843.97s">Or</a> it was either that or summer reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1845.351s">It</a> might have been both. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1846.532s">I</a> really didn't like both. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1848.033s">I</a> learned to love summer reading but still continued to hate the MCAS. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1852.555s">And</a> so, you know, being able to live out this childhood dream has been such a pleasure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1856.436s">And</a> I mean, I can't do it without the voters of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/604KtT5euRW9xzcHjtqysN?t=1859.817s">And</a> I thank them greatly for putting that trust into me and allowing me to do that and realize just how much I love this

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1544.994s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1545.775s">I</a> think I just wanted to, I think the, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1548.597s">The</a> voluntary aspect to clear up for anyone who might have heard that is at least from my perspective of advising students and seeing, you know, at least the college level students is. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1560.146s">At</a> least for the last 2 years, students have been faced with the. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1565.122s">split</a> decision of do I go to sports or do I work? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1570.183s">And</a> so for them to do volunteer work, you know, it can become a little tricky, especially if, you know, they're helping work with their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1576.724s">But</a> I just wanted to give, you know, commendation to Mr. Trotta and the whole team for doing this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1583.485s">I</a> mean, project based learning is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1585.725s">You</a> know, we've seen such amazing things for the district come out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1590.046s">So</a> I'm just happy to see that the great work is continuing and <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=1595.743s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to give my thanks to Trott and the team.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3107.905s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3111.266s">Well,</a> I understand why we want to pardon me, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3118.688s">If</a> part of me feels that the administration says they can do it with 11 or whatever, I'm sorry, the number's right here, 1140. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3126.214s">I</a> don't know how, I mean, I understand it's, I don't want to say just 15, but I'm curious to see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3135.0s">And</a> if the administration says 1140, we could support off 1140. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3137.782s">I</a> don't see why, I mean, I understand why we want to raise it to 15, but I would be more in support of the 1140 number as opposed to the 15, just because I know that, <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3147.255s">This</a> is a huge pain point for our families, and this may help bring some new folks in, and I understand there's financial assistance, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3160.158s">That's</a> sort of my two cents on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3161.978s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3926.175s">Just</a> a new member. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=3927.576s">Yes,</a> it's
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6387.367s">Yeah,</a> I was kind of elaborating on that, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6390.691s">I</a> think, you know, I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6392.65s">I</a> do think, um, you know, I concur with the mayor's point. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6395.151s">I</a> think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6395.971s">I</a> know speaking, so this might be a point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6399.412s">I</a> know being hired through the state system. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6402.393s">I</a> was hired to sub in on a contract basis and it had to be posted and I, you bring up the point of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6408.535s">Like,</a> I don't know if the APA was the reason why we had to post it or for his mass state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6413.216s">So</a> I do think we should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6414.957s">I</a> think we should look back into what the law mandates in terms of job postings, because we had to do that for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6420.642s">We</a> knew the candidate, and that was me, but it had to be posted for it for that exact reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6426.267s">So</a> we have to figure out why that is moving forward, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6431.011s">But</a> again, defer to not keep this held up.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6449.755s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6502.703s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6506.206s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6538.066s">Okay,</a> I'll defer to Member Graham, because Member Graham had the question pop up while we were voting on the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6544.191s">So</a> I'll defer to Member Graham first, if that's okay.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6925.023s">John,</a> you're up awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6927.064s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6927.585s">Um,</a> thank you for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6930.867s">It</a> was a very nice read. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6932.107s">It</a> was also nice to read that from my experience and from talking with. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6938.351s">Um,</a> some of our, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6941.693s">Lunchroom</a> workers for lunch appreciation day that a lot of these protocols already being followed and a lot of these are already kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6950.529s">being</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6951.23s">I</a> know that, correct me if I'm wrong, Director Silva, when it comes to coaching staff and allergies, the majority is already being implemented, especially with epinephrine in training. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6962.318s">Aren't</a> they supposed to be going through all this training already?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6972.853s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6973.534s">And</a> then, um, so if I may, because, you know, member Graham brings up the question of policy, how much of this is already. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6981.48s">Practice</a> that is being done and how much of it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6986.245s">Newer</a> in terms of what we'd like to see the district move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6989.988s">I</a> mean, I don't know if that's a loaded question. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=6993.371s">Is</a> that's a larger answer than what we can do tonight, but I'm just I'm just curious.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7041.401s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7042.463s">I</a> think some of the things that came up for me that seem newer I'm assuming the PTO guidelines are of that other 25%, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7050.795s">And</a> so, you know, I think, for me in terms of bake sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7057.872s">Um,</a> I think that some of those policies in place and, uh, you know, for the sake of this, I mean, I lost it already because acrobat went all the way to the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7066.095s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7066.875s">You</a> know, in terms of what happens within the buildings with allergen awareness, I think we have that jurisdiction to say, look, like, you need to put this post as you need to put this signage, because that is something that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7077.798s">Maybe</a> overlooked in terms of, like, we can't guarantee anything and sometimes that feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7084.627s">As</a> anyone who has an allergy feels like a scapegoat like they're just doing this to cover their butt, and that you know it's probably fine but now you've put this fear into me that it's not, but we really do for liabilities that we need to say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7095.49s">But</a> also because you know gluten is airborne, which some people may not know is that a gluten free kitchen, the airborne so you can clean all your pots all you want but it's airborne it's airborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7107.767s">I</a> think that was it in terms of questions for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7111.33s">I</a> think the only thing I also had was an amendment to the policy statement where it says it's literally the first sentence for some of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7123.179s">I</a> would also include staff because staff are going to be caught in the crossfire with some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7127.702s">So</a> in declaring that we acknowledge that allergies are a problem for our students, also acknowledging that it's a problem for our faculty and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7135.668s">because</a> if a student improperly washes their hands or a student improperly does something, and then they interact with the educator who has an allergy, I don't know how many cases we've had of that happen within the district, none that I've heard of, but I would like to see that be seen just in the, that's the only amendment I really have currently is to just add and staff to the first sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7157.996s">But</a> thank you for doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7159.336s">And</a> now I think the mayor's back, but I'll say defer to Eric, member Rentfeld.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7286.316s">I</a> believe it was Member Ruseau first, if that's all right.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7295.28s">So</a> I'm trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7296.9s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7298.221s">No,</a> it's not your fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7299.261s">It's</a> obviously the platform.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7304.616s">Oh,</a> I was just going to say I did notice in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7308.138s">One</a> thing I forgot to mention, I sort of mentioned this of, like, some of the new things we saw during lunch here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7312.421s">I</a> really do appreciate, by the way, the section that is sort of tidbits of what children may say if they're experiencing an allergic reaction for the first time in terms of what <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7322.668s">How</a> they feel because they may not be able to articulate that and the fact that that is if I'm not mistaken posted on the like refrigerators and ovens at the at the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7333.958s">So</a> that way it is of ease of access for our lunch servers to sort of in prep workers and chefs to see that So I did want to make that note as someone who was behind that wall for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7347.387s">That</a> seeing all that information readily available, which is being put into this as well is super cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7353.054s">So</a> just a small note of appreciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7354.736s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7595.036s">I</a> was just going to say for a note for the motion there was also a motion made by myself that to amend sentence one to add and staff next to students.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7786.471s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7790.734s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7793.05s">The</a> intent is not to infer that five-year-olds are gonna be responsible for a 43-year-old staff member to go into anaphylactic shock. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7799.532s">What</a> it is saying is that staff will take care of staff, but also the way I interpret the reading, it's not saying, it's just a background is what it seems like. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7809.835s">So</a> it's merely stating that we're keeping everyone safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7813.036s">That's</a> the gist of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7813.896s">And</a> that's why I included and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7815.736s">I</a> don't intend to think that a kindergartner will be held liable <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7821.532s">because</a> their teacher goes into anaphylactic shock because, yes, they pose that risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7824.894s">They</a> know it's the same thing as getting sick with cold season. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7827.175s">There</a> is that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7827.975s">But</a> this is a policy statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7830.476s">This</a> is part of the policy that it's just a mere statement saying that we're trying to keep people safe, which is why I asked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7837.219s">But</a> if the committee is not comfortable because it'll be somehow legally binding to include and staff, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7844.397s">It's</a> not a feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7845.338s">It's</a> not a I don't want to try to sue first graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7848.659s">It's</a> just that's the mere fact is it's a statement that we're trying to keep everyone safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7853.561s">And</a> it's not just students to staff or staff to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7856.763s">It's</a> also staff to staff and students to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7858.904s">So</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7860.845s">That's</a> all it is really. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=7862.365s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8231.576s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8232.136s">Member</a> Ruseau, is this just the policy that you were talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8236.495s">A</a> few weeks ago where it's like we had one and then we've been going by it, but it wasn't in the policy bank and now this is the reupload of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8243.217s">Or</a> is that is that what this one is with the field trips? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8246.198s">Or</a> is that a different one?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8262.755s">No,</a> I think that's the one, because I remember something about field trips, and I saw Director Sullivan nod her head, and I see the superintendent has her hand raised, so I'll be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8272.299s">Okay,</a> that was just a clarifying question, because I remember you said one of them were coming down the pipeline, and I wasn't sure if it was this one or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8280.543s">I</a> don't think I have any questions, and I'll defer to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8286.906s">Dr.</a> Galusi, do you still have a comment?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8501.558s">I</a> don't know why this is so sensitive.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8574.685s">Yeah,</a> we can start discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8576.988s">So,</a> basically, what this is, is, as I was looking through our policy bank for another policy in terms of just informing the community on what's been kind of going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8586.777s">I</a> found this policy in our wrong tab in our policy bank, which basically still says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8595.5s">MCAS</a> is still a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8596.941s">It's</a> a policy around the MCAS as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8599.003s">It's</a> a very outdated policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8600.485s">So</a> the idea was bring it to the committee so we can either strike it down here or refer it to some committee because there are other elements in this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8609.873s">It</a> is not just MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8612.295s">It</a> seems like it seems like there's some like attendance and AP exams and credit for award of certificate of mastery and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8620.027s">So</a> this isn't to, for anyone reading this, it's not to implement this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8624.169s">It</a> is that this policy is in our policy bank and we don't want it to conflict with our IKF graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8630.772s">So</a> it's to strike it or amend it so that way it no longer says this.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8651.198s">We</a> definitely need to strike the language around MCAS, but I guess I wasn't sure what the best what the committee feels is the best procedure for this is to either just strike down the policy as a whole and rebuild it, or if it's to. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=8665.642s">Refer</a> to subcommittee to then edit and then bring back.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9043.965s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9044.265s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9045.506s">Yeah,</a> so this sort of came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9048.688s">Uh,</a> actually speaking of director at the disability, the disability fair, um, at the McGlynn complex, it was brought up by several members in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9060.193s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9061.213s">To,</a> uh, the, the, the, those of us that were there, um, about the accessibility needs specifically, because we were in that building of the McGlynn complex and how the front door wasn't ADA accessible because of the lip, um, and that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9076.161s">who</a> was there actually had a ramp in the back of her vehicle and laid it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9081.684s">So</a> that way, those who were in wheelchairs or other mobility accessibility, you know, devices were able to get into the building as opposed to going around the back and, you know, to wherever that more accessible entrance is, which is a huge pain point for the members of the community who have to access that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9097.982s">It's</a> important to note that it was also brought to attention that it isn't just for those who need mobility aids, it was also for, you know, if EMS comes in and brings in a stretcher, it's easier to get them all with a lip, but then when they leave, if there's someone on the stretcher, it's not so easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9111.274s">But</a> it also just needs to be looked at anyways, because I myself will say from a personal point of privilege, I nearly <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9117.79s">fell</a> out of the door, leaving the NJHS ceremony because my foot got caught on it, was almost fully horizontal to the pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9126.674s">So</a> I don't have a physical disability and I nearly fell. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9131.496s">So</a> I can't even imagine what the members of our community that have to use that entryway go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9137.239s">So</a> this is sort of to look at not just the McGlynn complex, but also to look at the other entry points of our buildings to assess if there are <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9148.099s">Ways</a> that we can address these I'm sure some of them may be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9151.042s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9153.484s">As</a> we do work to the buildings that may get triggered by NDA. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9157.628s">Oh,</a> my gosh, the ADA. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9161.671s">And</a> so these things might already be set into motion for the McGlynn complex and the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9166.565s">Um,</a> but the thought was to take a look at, so that is fully acknowledge that this may be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9171.826s">Um,</a> but that, you know, miss a tuck and Brooks, like, looking at to see whether or not something as simple as. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9177.467s">Lowering</a> a door lip or things like that can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9181.228s">So</a> I understand that this is right at the heels of the school year and that the ask is to be right at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9188.17s">Um,</a> so please, if the, if the timeline needs to be adjusted, please feel free to make any suggestions administration, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9195.312s">The</a> goal is to just sort of look at what the needs are across the district in terms of this, so thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9777.326s">Yes,</a> thank you, Dr. Glucy. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9779.246s">I</a> put the first day of classes with the thought that it would be amended because picking a random date like October 3rd would just, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9787.01s">So</a> that was just because that was a point where we could put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9791.732s">But</a> yes, so yes, speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9796.285s">mentions</a> this and my colleagues have said, yes, the report that we got, I do remember, but that was only for McGlynn and Andrews, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of all the accessibility needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9805.098s">So</a> that's why this motion covers all of the buildings, because that report lives of McGlynn and Andrews, but we don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9813.46s">I</a> guess the point of the motion is more to see, are there easy fixes, like just switching out how thick that door lip is? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9822.126s">Because</a> again, I'm not talking about how wide the doors are. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9824.407s">I'm</a> talking about specifically that lip, because that's the issue that people are having, are getting over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9830.111s">It's</a> not fitting width-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9832.713s">It's</a> the actual lip of getting through the door that is the issue specific to the McGlynn complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9841.091s">And,</a> yes, I completely agree that when we start to replace fixtures like sinks, we should start doing it the new way and be proactive with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9847.293s">So</a> that way we save it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9848.513s">You</a> know, as you mentioned member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9851.074s">And</a> I think that's the only thing I wanted to mention other than the fact that completely acknowledge that we did get that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9858.137s">I</a> have yet to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9859.057s">I</a> know we received it because I acknowledge the receipt of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9862.611s">But</a> this is to go sort of get like a high level timeline of like, all right, what fixes are feasible? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9867.514s">What</a> is it going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9868.675s">What</a> are things that we acknowledge are issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9871.697s">Because</a> until that meeting, or until that event, there hadn't seemed like there had been an acknowledgement that there was a major accessibility issue at the front door of the McGlynn, from my perspective, at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9884.575s">So</a> I take the amendment of, I don't think we have a set timeline in terms of when it is due, just that we are requesting the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9893.097s">Dr.</a> Galusi, if that is the amendment I'm assuming you'd like to be made to the motion.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9957.697s">Absolutely</a> understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=9960.078s">Thank</a> you for the input.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yGcuIBQZTjc&t=10188.057s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-06-11_VUGwCJcKl8M/2025-06-11_VUGwCJcKl8M.html">FE&C SubCommittee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3340.914s">Yeah,</a> I was going to say, if I can, <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3343.447s">coming</a> from personal experience I know so for a lot of like the field trips yeah I agree that having those sort of expectations of what something may cost what I will say with like the proms is it changes year by year, because it's based on how much the class fund raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3361.685s">And</a> so that one is one that will always be kind of like a heaven full of like there might be a range but like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3367.888s">It</a> really is like, we were able to bring it down below a hundred for the first time because we had very successful Yankee Candles, but then it can shoot back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3376.43s">And</a> so, you know, I think also there's also that thing of like making sure people are involved in helping with fundraisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/VUGwCJcKl8M&t=3383.512s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4009.045s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4010.185s">I</a> just echo all the comments of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4012.366s">Thank</a> you both for doing all the work you've done to make the Medford Public Schools a better place for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4018.328s">The</a> framework you guys have set up will continue to do so even while you are both in your respective roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4025.81s">You</a> know, it was funny, I think reflecting on the past <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4030.39s">not</a> exactly two years of being here, you know, some of the two first thoughts I had was what exactly is Peter's job description because of the amount of hats that he wears and the amount of things he does, is he Marcont? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4040.734s">What</a> is he doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4042.034s">And</a> then the second, when I state, you know, oh, I work for the Metropolitan School Committee, it's like, isn't Paul Teixeira just great? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4049.136s">Isn't</a> he just phenomenal? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4051.797s">And</a> so you both really are very key figures in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4056.019s">And</a> I just want to thank you both for doing, you know, the work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4060.913s">Like</a> the mayor said, it is bittersweet, but excited to see what you guys do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=4066.037s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5798.791s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5800.231s">So</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5801.491s">Thank</a> you all for doing the work and trying to figure out this <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5806.501s">very</a> large issue of space capacity that we have within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5811.386s">So</a> I was not able to attend the meeting and I didn't get a chance to watch it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5816.611s">So</a> I just wanted to ask a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5818.592s">Was</a> there a specific reason as to why the Missituk was chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5821.996s">Was</a> it just because of the space?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5832.205s">I</a> just wasn't sure, because I know we have a good amount of, I believe, services going on at the Mississippi, so I just wanted to make sure that that wouldn't cause an issue of introducing another, like, again, just wanted to cover all bases because I just don't want it to, I just want to make sure that that was accounted for, and also the fact that those folks were consulted on that decision.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=5999.48s">Awesome,</a> yeah, no, I think what I'm pulling from is, I believe it was, while we're talking about budget cycles, last budget cycle, the Missittuck came up quite a bit just because while there is lower enrollment in certain areas, there are higher needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6011.842s">And</a> so that's why I sort of was curious if folks from the Missittuck were consulted with, how much disruption, not disruption, but how much bringing it in would cause, but if that has been considered then.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6094.791s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6096.131s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6096.411s">I'm</a> sure this all was answered in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6098.192s">It's</a> just not something I had a chance to look at yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6100.692s">So</a> I just wanted to ask it on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CsSw9Cunt1k&t=6102.053s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-05-19_SGdnUuDa2t4/2025-05-19_SGdnUuDa2t4.html">05.19.2025 Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4230.336s">what</a> defines a club sport? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4232.117s">Because</a> like, I know that we don't have like an official rugby team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4234.678s">We</a> don't have an official Pulse McFrisbee team, but like we do have an official crew team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4239.2s">So</a> I know that might confuse, I mean, it confused me, but it might confuse some members of the public of what that is defined as. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4245.063s">Because</a> I know like, I'm not sure if rowing is the only one that's not under the MIA umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4252.147s">I</a> know that they're under MPSRA, not under MIA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4255.068s">So</a> I'm not sure if that's what the qualifier is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4258.707s">But</a> I mean, obviously it still counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4260.808s">That's</a> the big thing is it still counts under this because it's sanctioned by the school and runs into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4266.192s">But</a> I think it was just more of like a point of information question.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4313.395s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4313.615s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4313.775s">That's</a> where my, that's where kind of my question was, because I know that, you know, when we were under, when I was on the rowing team, you know, it wasn't MIA, it wasn't part of that, but there's still a sort of a state competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4325.603s">There's,</a> and it's technically two different sports in the fall and the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4331.816s">but</a> that was sort of what defines a club sport and also what does that mean for students who want to pursue the, because I love the independent study option. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4341.845s">I</a> think that that's phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4343.827s">And</a> I'll get into that in a second, but that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4346.829s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4351.053s">So</a> I sort of, you know, I echo the thoughts I think of my colleague member Graham in terms of giving people more of that flexibility and choice, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4359.582s">We</a> talk a lot about purpose-driven leadership when it comes to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility and students sort of picking that, charting their course, if you will, in how they navigate, you know, high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4375.053s">And</a> then, you know, if they pursue higher ed, you know, there's all these options of what you specifically study and all that fun stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4380.397s">And</a> I know that we do it, I've seen the benefit to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4384.965s">art</a> school version of a rotation where you have students come in that wanna be two-dimensional, but then they end up becoming a glass major. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4392.687s">And</a> we've had discussions with our graphic design department and graphics department about students not realizing the full potential because maybe they're not done through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4403.61s">Maybe</a> like this is what they're interested in, but they don't realize the benefit of like working corporate graphic design or working public in terms of the way that they're doing what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4413.605s">So</a> I think giving them the more flexibility there, I would agree to a lot of that, those choices in terms of, you know, we encourage, you know, we still offer health or we still offer PE, you know, you know, for four years, but, you know, giving yourself that flexibility where, you know, maybe if you could use that time to focus on the arts or focus on some other things within the CTE program like that might benefit, you know, I know that I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4439.626s">The</a> way we used to do it was it was two quarters health two quarters fitness or. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4444.849s">So</a> i'm wondering if you know when we're looking at scheduling if we decided that you know, because I still think a health program in the first year is essential, you know there's a lot of things that are going on, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4456.168s">we've</a> gotten talks about, we've gotten emails from students about mental health concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4460.111s">And</a> all of a sudden you're in high school and that's a whole different ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4462.813s">And</a> how do you navigate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4463.893s">How</a> do you know how to sort of cope with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4466.695s">And</a> so even if it's as simple or I shouldn't say simple, but even if it's as, all right, half the students as first years, you go to fitness, half go to health and then switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4479.564s">Cause</a> I think that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4481.494s">when</a> I was in high school.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4484.075s">What's</a> currently happening, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4487.197s">So</a> even if it's one per week for that, you know, like, or if people can choose to go on the track of, I mean, that might be even more of a scheduling nightmare of <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4497.14s">you</a> know, they opt into staying for the whole academic year to be in PE, or they wanna do the switch, or they wanna, you know, just, again, giving them that flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4505.604s">And</a> I know we don't wanna create too, too many options. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4508.205s">I</a> know that that becomes then a logistics nightmare, and, you know, we don't wanna put a strain on our staff, but, you know, if there are students who, you know, are like, I think that I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna play football, and I wanna, you know, play PE, and I wanna stay active, and I wanna do that, because that's the course I wanna go, or even if they don't go through higher ed, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4526.759s">whatever,</a> you know, then they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4528.3s">Or,</a> you know, someone's like, Hey, I got a lot of things going on and I want to know more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4533.142s">Then</a> they have that option to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4535.203s">Um,</a> so I sort of echo the comments, um, about member Ruseau and Graham of giving people that flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4542.707s">Um,</a> and if you already have the expectation that they're both running for the academic year, you know, it's just a matter of spacing in terms of classes, you know, like their health is always going to be running and PE is always going to be running. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4554.633s">So</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4556.338s">or</a> maybe I'm thinking about it too broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4557.958s">I'm</a> not gonna pretend like I understand what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4560.839s">Then</a> they can either stay concurrent with those two, I'm staying in health first half, second half, or I'm switching. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4569.401s">So</a> then that still benefits the plan that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4572.522s">I'm</a> just trying to think more, I don't think holistic's the word, but trying to think more broad of again, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4578.028s">we're</a> getting close, we need to get the schedule down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4580.869s">What</a> is the most creative fix that we can maybe pilot and see like, does this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4586.271s">If</a> it becomes a scheduling logistics, we know we've got to come back this time next year and go, all right, maybe we need to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4593.714s">But</a> I think we do need to stress because it could be miscommunicated that say we take up member Graham's amendment <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4604.783s">three</a> years PE, two years health, that doesn't mean that health isn't only offered those two years, that that is just the requirement, and you have to complete it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4612.034s">I</a> think for arts, what is it, one year? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4614.157s">I</a> did it for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4616.08s">I</a> did orchestra first period every year, except for when they made it second period. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4620.59s">and</a> Mr. Zegna got really mad about it, rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4624.133s">So</a> they, like just making sure the public is aware that that is the case, that it is still being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4630.739s">We're</a> not taking gym away for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4632.701s">We're</a> not taking health away for two years.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4649.358s">Well,</a> I think that's great because, you know, I think, yes, they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4652.399s">And,</a> you know, we just had food allergy awareness week, you know, like, do we have a whole curriculum of health about how to deal with Narcan and epinephrine and all these other life-saving drugs that we don't talk about? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4664.422s">Is</a> there a health elective that is just life-saving medication? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4670.204s">how</a> to administer it, how to help someone in need, or how to help yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4674.688s">Is</a> there stuff on sex ed? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4676.329s">Is</a> there stuff on mental health? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4678.391s">It</a> kind of gives it that for people to, for students to make that choice where they can have the option, but also to be comfortable with that option and to maybe, I want to <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4691.74s">you</a> know, high school might be the place to learn of like, hey, do I wanna become a psychologist? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4695.242s">Do</a> I wanna become a psychiatrist? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4696.623s">Do</a> I wanna go into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4697.364s">Maybe</a> let me, or sports training. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4699.065s">Maybe</a> let me take that health class on mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4702.267s">Let</a> me take that health class on life-saving medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4706.029s">Oh,</a> I didn't really enjoy that class. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4707.23s">Maybe</a> that's not for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4708.191s">That</a> helps limit my horizon.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4712.654s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4832.888s">So</a> I might have missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4834.429s">Was</a> that part of the amendment, was there the talk of looking at health being offered in the first year?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4845.335s">Then</a> I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4845.875s">I</a> was wondering if I needed to add another amendment or motion to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=4848.757s">But</a> if it's in that motion, if it is technically ingrained in that, thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5622.298s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5623.361s">Sorry,</a> I stepped out for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5625.246s">But</a> did we talk about what the salary range was going to be?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5633.443s">Okay,</a> because I do know I, I shouldn't say I know, but I'm pretty sure there's a new state law that we have to put the salary range on all job posting so I don't think competitive salary convention with experience will cut it I think they need hard fast numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5649.377s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're in compliance with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5653.222s">which</a> I should have caught that for I think for some other ones we've looked at but I just am now hiring students for my day job so I know that I've had to put, you know, very specifically, this amount, this range of hours in order to be compliant with mass state law so just making sure that when we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5670.041s">I</a> know like you have here like bracket insert Medford public schools application portal I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5675.479s">Um,</a> we just need to make sure that we have that salary range, however big it may be, you know, like you said, commensurate with experience, I think in order to just be compliant, we need to just have like actual numbers and we could be, we shouldn't do, you know, like, I don't know, like 80 to 160 K, but like that is technically compliance as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5696.448s">But</a> I think like making sure we're as close as possible to what realistically is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5700.51s">And</a> then that I think has to come in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5702.531s">I'm</a> pretty sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5703.352s">Um,</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5714.663s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5904.485s">I</a> think to simplify the amendment just I think the simple line of and other duties as assigned by the superintendent so that way it is clear where that instruction is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5912.328s">But,</a> you know, that is, I think my job description even says like other duties as assigned, which is pretty vague but I think including them at by the superintendent of schools or interim superintendent of schools will be
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5936.475s">So</a> I think, yeah, that's what we said. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=5940.015s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6305.877s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6308.218s">So</a> I'm excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6309.019s">I'm</a> excited to see the, that's the boring part, decrease in cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6315.204s">So</a> on the state side, at the state institution I work at, we actually use PaperCut as a printing platform, and there are a lot of positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6322.129s">There</a> are a few drawbacks, like you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6326.36s">Internet</a> goes down, what's good is that the way PaperCut works is it sends to all the printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6332.844s">So</a> realistically it's because it's tied to your ID badge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6335.506s">If</a> you go to print to the nurse's office or on the third floor of C building or even in the Brooks, like it still goes through and you're able to print from wherever. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6343.651s">This</a> is a no means an endorsement of PaperCut conflict of interest law, but because we don't use it, we use it, but it's not an endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6353.197s">What's</a> also good is that we can set up specialized accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6356.319s">We</a> know where the money's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6357.56s">So</a> there's way people can, if people hold multiple hats or hold multiple roles, you can actually assign different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6362.803s">So</a> when you go in and you go to print, it says like from a dropdown, like from a shared department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6367.667s">So,</a> you know, at my place of work, you know, I could say, oh, this is coming from student government, or this is coming from student engagement, or this is coming from housing and residence life, you know, wherever it will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6379.194s">So</a> the only, I think, pain point <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6381.808s">we</a> have for users is getting used to loading money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6386.63s">So</a> I'm not sure how that logistical work, but I do think that this is the, from personal experience of using the paper cut platform, I do think this is a good print management solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=6398.696s">So</a> I can put the motion on the floor to approve the recommendations.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7886.568s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7887.428s">And</a> thank you for the context. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7889.169s">It's</a> really good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7891.531s">We've</a> done protocol, which I remember in the rowing team, there was protocol when someone got a concussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7898.434s">My</a> question is, so looking through, it looks like the sort of the pre-agreement that students have, I'm sorry, the specific language is the MIA Pre-Participation Sports Candidate Medical Questionnaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7914.653s">Is</a> that we just using that as a because I have a feeling this question might come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7919.664s">Are</a> we just using that as the standard? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7922.569s">Or</a> is it only for MIA sanctioned sports? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7927.679s">or</a> is that going, is that form? <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7930.601s">It</a> is the, so it's on the second page, it's under purpose, it's under, I'm sorry, pre-participation requirement training, page four, it's like the big body paragraph, the first big body paragraph right there, where it mentions how the students, oh, it just says extracurricular athletic activities, okay, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7950.585s">It's</a> just anyone who's participating extracurricular athletic activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7953.606s">It's</a> not just specific to MIA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7955.246s">It's</a> club sports, rugby, whatever have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7959.207s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7959.527s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7959.907s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7960.287s">That</a> was just, I didn't see that first sentence, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7962.767s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=7963.187s">That's</a> my only question.<h2><a href="../2025-05-06_V2-HjCd92gQ/2025-05-06_V2-HjCd92gQ.html">05.05.2025 Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7702.514s">Because</a> the monthly and yearly are both, both options are less than what is the 2024 and 2025 number. <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7710.478s">So</a> I'm not sure what the actual 25 and 26 number is, if that is the actual number, but all of them go up except for that one.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5759.489s">I</a> also just yeah I really want to echo that point of like while these things <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5763.913s">I</a> guess what I want to say is when this list is sent to us, I really do welcome any community input about a lot of these issues because like, again, while they may be small to some people who may be a little more able-bodied or may not run into these issues, it's good to know like if someone has like, oh, I'm not crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5783.301s">Like</a> this is actually something that significantly impacts my mobility, or this is something that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5789.528s">just</a> the day to day like this is a small frustration like yeah my knees get colder like they get burned from that like this is, these are all really good things that I would hope that the community would also be able to take a look at and say I used to I frequent this building this is something that affects me on a daily basis I thought it was small but I'm not crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5804.815s">Just</a> that little affirmation of like no this needs to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5808.636s">And</a> we acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5810.445s">Um</a> but II do want to get a little bit away from the like, well, it's a little small like it does seem small to some people but like it really is a huge thing for a lot of people's day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5819.75s">So,</a> just welcome that community input whenever that list is made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5824.173s">So,</a> thank you to my colleagues for for raising that that concern and ask and thank you for doing the work and thank you for acknowledging it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-19_Aod_AldxCno/2025-03-19_Aod_AldxCno.html">Joint Meeting of the Medford City Council and Medford School Committee to Discuss FY 26 Budget</a></h2>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4028.743s">Yeah,</a> if we could sever that amendment, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4031.685s">I</a> mean, I mean, I'm also I'm also open to amending the amendment and just saying, to just be available in an on call support manner throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4040.708s">as</a> opposed to in an on-call manner, 24 hours a day throughout the year.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=175.752s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=176.693s">Um,</a> so it came up the other day about possible conflict of interest due to some familial ties within the schools, especially since we are going into union MTA contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=190.061s">I'm</a> here to say that after talking with the lawyer of the day with the state, they have advised me that due to the severance of how far <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=198.342s">We</a> are in terms of, you know, being family that and because there's no financial gain on my end. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=204.89s">The</a> only thing I have to do is file disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest as required by general law 26 a section 23 b3. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=212.608s">And</a> I basically just have to file that that's been filed with the city clerk and I just have to read this on the floor and then we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=218.37s">But</a> I do not have to abstain from union negotiations with the MTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=222.231s">This</a> is just the thing I have to do in order to actually be a voting member when it comes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=227.993s">So</a> it's basically, this is on file with the city clerk, but I basically am just an in-law relative to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=234.015s">Jacqueline</a> Gatto, the teacher at the Brooks Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=236.96s">I'm</a> a second cousin or first cousin removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=239.141s">I'm</a> not really sure to miss Nicole Sulo, teacher at the books elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=243.142s">I'm</a> also technically a member of the math teachers association, but I'm in the association of professional administrators, which at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=250.184s">So</a> there's a completely different subgroup than the MTA Medford teachers association. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=254.346s">My</a> union gets no financial gain from any, you know, negotiations that happen between the city and the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=260.368s">So</a> we've read this on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=261.828s">I'm</a> fine to continue, but just wanted it in record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=264.717s">Um,</a> and if people want to see the full thing, they can contact the city clerk, but thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8005.347s">And</a> because of that, I have talked with a lot of parents, especially about the need for bringing a lot of our services in-house and how we need to have programs for students that can equal the playing field, have an equitable experience in our schools, because it's just not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8020.319s">So</a> I want to thank you personally for a lot of the advocacy work that you're doing and for coming here and giving your point of view and thought process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8030.867s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8067.54s">over</a> the years that I've been involved in the conversation that I'm just really happy to see where it's at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8073.906s">And</a> I'm excited to see where he's going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8076.989s">Yes,</a> yes.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8202.805s">I</a> know that some of our staff representatives from our nursing union were here earlier and they had sent an email asking for support because, you know, looking at how the budget's been and the positions that have been reestablished just really isn't doing it for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8218.877s">And,</a> you know, personally, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8221.107s">I</a> have my full support for reestablishing the positions that we lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8226.532s">That</a> was one of the big talking points that we had talked about, or that had been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8232.198s">So</a> I would actually motion <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8235.157s">to</a> pull from the undistributed to either restore at least one floater position, motion to amend the supplemental appropriation of the 2024 just to give them at least, I know that probably having all four positions back isn't something we could swing, but I feel like having at least one other additional floater within the unit might be, especially because as it relates to question eight, with extending the day, we may need some additional staffing needs when it comes to that.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8293.83s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8294.11s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8294.991s">I</a> didn't mean to interrupt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8296.912s">So</a> then it would go from, so we lost four. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8299.053s">We</a> brought in one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8300.173s">So</a> then three were missing.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8302.314s">We</a> lost three. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8302.975s">So</a> then now we're missing two.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8312.028s">OK.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-12-11_2Yhv5Nitagw/2024-12-11_2Yhv5Nitagw.html">MSC Special Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=121.885s">If</a> I could just add, you know, I share very similar thoughts of minimal disruption, you know, in particular with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=128.59s">When</a> I think of who I would want in the role of the interim, you know, I want someone who <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=138.683s">I'm</a> trying to figure out a way to really phrase this, but, you know, someone who during negotiations can work with our, with our, with our, you know, bargaining units, someone who can really work to striving some repairing some relationships and just working towards, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=156.758s">just</a> again, like while we're going through all of this, just minimal disruptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=161.52s">And</a> I guess I just echo a lot of the same, but wanted to throw my two cents in there of, you know, observing behaviors, looking at who, you know, embodies that spirit of the Mustang Way and the spirit of who can lead, you know, the district in this interim period and possibly, you know, if they choose to apply and get appointed through the search. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=183.79s">So</a> those are my thoughts.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=296.089s">Could</a> I just, you know, point of clarification ask how, because we mentioned us all giving nominations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=301.394s">So,</a> if our nominations differ, how do we go about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=304.517s">Presenting</a> that effectively and how do we do that as a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=307.981s">Do</a> we just do we vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=311.184s">Do</a> we do 7 different motions is that 1 motion to a point if you could just clarify that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=316.128s">So</a> I fully understand what is going on.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=371.656s">Yes,</a> I would like to additionally nominate Mr. Paul Teixeira to be our interim superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=381.643s">I</a> really liked Member Ruseau's language of, I believe, effective January 18th through June 30th, 2026, contingent on a successful contract negotiation.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=483.974s">Teixeira.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=562.096s">Yeah,</a> I don't think that's going to change, so it's fine leaving it as is.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=570.699s">Oh,</a> okay, I understand.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=596.165s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU/2024-12-02_53d9Rk8X1OU.html">12.2.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6005.619s">If</a> I could just say really quick before everyone leaves, I have a long history with Medford rowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6011.36s">I</a> actually was on one of the inaugural middle school sculling teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6014.34s">So</a> I actually learned how to scull before sweeping and went through the team in my seventh grade year and eighth grade year at the Andrews and then all four years of high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6025.962s">I</a> don't remember a time we've meddled this grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6029.266s">First</a> of all, during the fall season, kudos to you for being able to do that in a fall season, rolling those three miles up to the start and then the three miles all the way back and still being able to pull ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6038.796s">That's</a> absolutely insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6041.138s">But</a> I was super proud and super impressed just to see this from <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6045.703s">you</a> know, my time as a rower, my time as a coxswain at this height, which was crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6050.024s">Um,</a> but then also my time as a coach during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6053.065s">And</a> then now like my favorite time of the year is getting to come and dock Marshall, the mayor's cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6057.907s">Um,</a> and I just, just absolutely so proud of you all just keep doing what you're doing and just see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.209s">I</a> didn't even think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.989s">So</a> I was sitting here, this grand of an achievement in the fall season, <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6068.65s">just</a> keep doing what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6070.33s">I'm</a> so happy to see the team still going strong, even through the pandemic, now that we're, you know, where we are now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6075.712s">So</a> just congratulations and keep doing what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6079.153s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.193s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.673s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11414.485s">I</a> think it goes without saying why this is on the agenda and why this is being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11420.306s">A</a> lot of what this does is it affirms the actions we have taken to the ongoing incident with the lead being discovered in our school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11430.968s">And</a> it takes the recommendations of the MWRA and the state of Massachusetts, as well as some federal guidelines and determinations of <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11438.703s">frequency</a> of testing, what happens if we identify that there is presence of said metals in the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11447.305s">I</a> will say just for point of clarification in the policy reading, the policy states for in the presence of lead results in the range of one to less than 15 ppb. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11459.007s">And</a> then there is there is a less than sign just to that just is mainly also for the copper level because there <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11466.198s">wasn't</a> an identifiable range. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11468.54s">Obviously,</a> the pipes are made of copper. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11472.263s">It's</a> more of like one that starts to really, really leak into the water, usually due to age, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11480.389s">So</a> it's just a matter of making sure that once it hits 1,300, that's when they need to be disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11484.413s">And</a> there wasn't really like a safe, like, oh, it's hand washing only. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11487.455s">I</a> couldn't find that anywhere, which is why it's a little less detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11491.538s">But</a> this is to, <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11494.349s">reaffirm</a> our commitment to making sure our community is informed, to making sure that it is clear the action to take when this is discovered, and how long we should be really kicking it into gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11511.333s">But</a> I don't think I really have any further comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11513.314s">I</a> welcome as many questions as there are.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11548.51s">I</a> don't, maybe, hold on.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11554.894s">It's</a> just disabled as in like it cannot, that was following the guidance of what we followed through our testing and through what we've been doing, where if it was above 15 parts per billion, the fixture was disabled until we could figure out a cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11568.323s">And</a> so it's not, it's removed, not physically. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11571.405s">And</a> that, if that, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11576.708s">But</a> the idea was that that was way too high of a level of lead and that it could not be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11582.353s">And</a> that furthers the philosophy that we've been using of we want to make sure that even if flushing is available, we cannot be certain that that is happening at an adequate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11593.423s">And</a> we need to just take proper action. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11597.166s">So</a> that is following the philosophy of what we are currently doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11603.399s">And</a> that is a concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11604.68s">And</a> I agree with that philosophy of, even if it's flushing, like, let's just get it down until we can figure out the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11611.743s">Because</a> it's not even like a comment of, there's no good faith that people don't know how to time it or people know how to do it, but it's just not giving the opportunity for that to possibly happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11623.108s">And</a> I hope that clarifies the understanding.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11634.865s">The</a> ranges were through the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11637.547s">And</a> then it was mainly to reaffirm the ranges with the MWRA as well as, so according to the 310CMR2, the Massachusetts drinking water regulations as well as what we have been doing with the recommendation from UMass Amherst and MassDEP.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11971.275s">And</a> if I may, that is why I really appreciate the, and it was, it crossed my mind as writing the policy to put the frequency to a year just to see, I have a hope and a feeling that we will not have to go into that realm of testing everyone twice a calendar year if it's lead detected after we fix and solve the issue that is happening within our schools now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12000.631s">because</a> those are a lot of areas impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12004.813s">And</a> I'm hoping that once that is fixed, we won't have to go into the realm of doing it every year, once a year, as stated in the policy, which is why also they're separated between two and four of the priority of really making sure ones that we are consuming are being tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12025.95s">And</a> that range comes from also, I believe was the MWR's range of three to five years for just testing in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12033.317s">And</a> so around the side of caution of doing two and four. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12038.722s">So</a> I appreciate that, because again, if we find that we do not simply have the people power or the funds to do this at this frequency, we at least know that we've done our part to help fix the issue we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12052.392s">And</a> then we can revisit it and figure out what the problem is and how to amend that.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12072.416s">To</a> me, if I may, Mayor, the part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12080.572s">policy</a> where it says what the plan is has already been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12084.773s">So</a> to me, this is the start of that two-year cycle of we've already done all the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12094.835s">So</a> if the policy is enacted, we are already within that cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12098.396s">So</a> we now have two years to retest. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12101.157s">That's</a> when that started. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12102.937s">And</a> I think that that is a comfortable date to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12106.167s">because</a> we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12107.287s">We</a> tested them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12108.068s">We're</a> going to have to keep testing them to make sure that our solutions are permanent solutions, that we didn't just fix a small issue, that we actually got down to the root of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12116.53s">We</a> figured it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12117.591s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12119.711s">But</a> in my eyes, that two-year calendar has started. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12122.872s">And</a> if we have to push it to be in two more years when it gets like that's when it officially gets, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12127.614s">I</a> don't understand the logistics of that quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12129.715s">But</a> to clarify that, that is my thought process with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12135.188s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4/2024-11-18_ucoZOAdkTf4.html">11.18.2024 - Regular MSC Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8685.37s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to say, you know, in <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8687.481s">in</a> that same vein as we were talking about, about, you know, the arts department, how do we work with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8692.682s">My</a> point was actually going to be about the graphic design department who I've had the fortunate ability to work with as a student in doing stuff with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8704.425s">But</a> this may not be a, maybe not a topic for tonight, but the question of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8711.132s">we're</a> seeing enrollment in the graphic design department and possibly helping alleviate that sort of wait list, you know, if we can get more people into the graphic design department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8722.056s">As</a> you know, we have two educators in there, making sure we're not overwhelming them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8725.338s">But</a> I know that in my time as a student at MassArt, I was a design major, but I was not in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8736.055s">Graphic</a> design department, but they switched from graphic design to calm design communication design and doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8743.278s">brought</a> a bit more of opportunity for their students, mainly our. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8749.793s">students</a> who are from other countries, because that helps with visas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8755.379s">By</a> changing it to com design and by changing some of the GL class identifications, it actually makes it part of STEM in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8762.506s">So</a> that may open us up to some other grant opportunities, whether that be a future educator who's a visiting artist or maybe a part-time employee <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8771.269s">but</a> also to upgrade what we have as a shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8774.893s">So</a> that discussion of possibly, and when you change the comm design is more, I guess, theory based and it is more, you know, a lot of the education is more surrounding the whys and strategy which when folks go if they choose to go to places like MassArt or other higher education institutions, <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8793.151s">It</a> almost better serves them if they are getting that communication design, which is still very similar graphic design education, but it almost gears them up more for that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8804.334s">I</a> know like, you know, it's one of the smallest here, but at SR it's the largest department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8809.675s">And</a> I don't think people fully realize the benefits to a graphic designer communication design education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8817.726s">I</a> don't think people view it too much as an art thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8820.387s">But</a> I know some institutions, it's almost looked down upon in their vocational schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8824.569s">But</a> I feel like the opportunities are very, I mean, you can't go anywhere without a graphic designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8831.071s">Everyone's</a> hiring them.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7186.457s">I</a> have no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7188.559s">That</a> wasn't, I'm sorry, that wasn't the point of my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7190.581s">That</a> was just a hypothetical, just like a question of if that route were to be explored, where it was just a support and like a training factor, if we needed to take that vote anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7202.092s">That</a> was just my question, but no, I completely understand and I can only imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7206.773s">But</a> it sounds like Superintendent Edouard-Vincent has some pointers or Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.434s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.854s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7215.295s">But</a> I yield my time.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7476.105s">I</a> was just going to make another amendment to, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7481.089s">A</a> lot of the temporary work until January 1 alongside sending its committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7487.193s">But,</a> um, that's dependent on if you want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7490.956s">Take</a> the amendment or not, but just to revisit it, if it's as dire as you're saying, and I are the same, you know, if this is unauthorized work. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7498.223s">You</a> know, I don't, I can't wrap my head around that right now, but if this is work that needs to be directly done and needs to make, ensure that our families are getting the needs that they need, then I would be comfortable authorizing temporarily to be revisited on January 1 after findings from the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7516.034s">And</a> that's the, I motion to amend that original motion.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2336.525s">OK,</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2337.326s">No,</a> I just wanted a clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2338.866s">And</a> then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2358.411s">I</a> guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2363.913s">But</a> that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2371.937s">So</a> I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2375.998s">And</a> then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2380.28s">Because</a> the last number I saw was June. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2383.117s">Do</a> we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2386.642s">Like</a> when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5025.999s">And</a> thank you everyone for giving this valuable information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5028.82s">I</a> think, you know, from what it sounds like the city, your program is a phenomenal program to help, you know, professionally develop students, you know, at a time in their life after high school, uh, my initial concern was about the funding portion, but the a hundred thousand or the 200,000 and, you know, scraping from revolving funds or from the before and after school program, because I know we're still, we're, it's on the agenda tonight to talk about the budget and we're, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5053.885s">It's</a> not ideal what we're doing in the budget, and we're trying to fit in a $100,000, possibly $200,000 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5060.612s">that</a> I don't know if spend budgeted for in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5063.733s">And</a> that part sort of just concerns me a little bit, I guess, to put it out there before we vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5070.815s">And</a> also, is this vote to start negotiations, to start talks, or is this vote to approve the actual program? <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5079.877s">Because</a> while it seems like an amazing program, and from what I could tell, it really is, I just have concerns about bringing it in a time <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5086.619s">where</a> we're doing layoffs and scraping revolving funds to just get by for a level service, and we're trying to introduce more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5095.702s">So</a> I'm sorry to be so negative about that, but that's just sort of where my concerns are at.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8145.947s">Yeah,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8146.888s">I</a> also want to say, as I <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8149.963s">I</a> don't want to sound nonchalant when I talk about cuts, but I do want to acknowledge that these are people's lives and positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8154.926s">So</a> I don't want it to seem so casual when I, when we discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8159.448s">Um,</a> so I want to acknowledge that and all the people who made their voices heard, but Jerry, just a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8164.45s">So</a> in here with page 13, it talks about adding back positions that were cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8171.894s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8178.283s">So</a> the, and maybe I just misread. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8180.544s">So</a> this is why, this is why we asked the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8183.325s">Um,</a> so the performing arts director, the assistant director of athletics, are those all positions now funded through the budget because they're not listed here anymore?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8225.737s">So</a> the director of performing arts is still is still out.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.36s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.921s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8233.183s">Um,</a> just wanted to double check because as much as I just talked about transparency, that just wasn't clear and wanted to double check with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8239.787s">Um,</a> I think at this moment, that's all I have, but if another question arise, I will let it be.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9871.38s">I</a> was hoping to possibly make an amendment to also add into the language to find a way to increase the stipend pay for the band director with the idea that the pay that it is at may not be attractive to external candidates and that there will be a significant decline in the program's activity.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9893.956s">Is</a> it contractual?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9898.579s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9899.44s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9999.892s">Yes,</a> I would be willing to adapt that language, amend my amendment to amend to that language for the amendment of your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10008.038s">So</a> be it there.

more comments than questions, maybe a little bit of both, but wanted to take the opportunity to sort of give my concerns to also let people know that they are heard because a lot of them are from the many, many emails that we have gotten over the last two to three weeks, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8721.161s">And</a> I just want to take a moment and apologize to those who I wasn't able to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8724.662s">immediately</a> right away but really appreciate you reaching out with your personal experience and things that are going on and your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8734.491s">Again,</a> some of the things, I'm really concerned about us bouncing back and sort of, not bouncing back, really relying on the staffing recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8744.677s">I</a> feel like, you know, May is mental health awareness month and we are in a mental health epidemic in crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8750.941s">And</a> I'm really, really concerned about the amount of nursing, the health cuts, as well as the guidance Councilor cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8757.865s">I</a> know there are adjustment Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8759.086s">I</a> know we still have 17 of those in this proposed budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8762.248s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8763.749s">The</a> ease of access to students are the nurses, those are the people who if you are having a panic attack, you go right to the nurses, I have done that numerous times at the high school, it is someone where if you don't know where to go, that is a safe haven, and I know the high school still has three, but that's just an example of, you know, later on, however, I worry about the ones that you know the one full time I know there's some sharing going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8786.104s">I</a> made the comment at the last meeting and we'll make it again about how one can be a little dangerous, especially when it comes to medication at all levels, you know, you can't be administered education, I mean, you can't be administered medication without a nurse present you can't not give it to yourself, whether you are seven or you are 19 that is just not a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8809.065s">And</a> so I wanted to really push back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8812.069s">You</a> know, I'm, you know, seeing go from six to four but still really concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8817.295s">A</a> lot of my other concerns have already been echoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8820.679s">When</a> it comes to the performing arts I'm really happy to hear that you know there's going to be a stipend position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8825.905s">I'm</a> really concerned about a stipend position to fund the marching band and color guard because that is such an intensive program in our education system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8833.847s">I</a> was an orchestra kid, so I got to witness firsthand how much, you know, work they put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8838.708s">And</a> I also want to make a comment that I didn't make earlier, but, you know, we made a comment about how many people were repeating and repeatedly standing up with our students, but I want to notice how many of our humanity success stories had a performing arts marching band and color guard garments on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8871.977s">It's</a> a lot, it's a lot of work, and I've seen it and I worry that when we start to stipend or we start to do that the work may not be, I don't want to say appealing to someone but it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8884.783s">And</a> oftentimes what that happens is it creates a work environment that is too tiring and then people leave and then we don't want people you know that we've had here for 14 years that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8893.467s">really</a> love the work, but then can't afford to do the work anymore, so they make that tough decision to leave, and then we can't find someone to replace them because no one wants to do that work for however much money that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8904.398s">So</a> those are some of the big concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8905.499s">That</a> was a lot of the concerns we had gotten in emails was about the performing arts position directly in the state of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8910.904s">I</a> know there was a lot of misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8912.206s">I</a> know there was a lot of talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8913.807s">the</a> performing arts program being slashed or cut entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8917.608s">But</a> that's one of the main concerns I have as someone who sees that sort of on a day-to-day about, you know, people being underpaid, people wanting to have these ambitions and not being able to fulfill them because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8928.57s">The</a> performing arts, there's a huge, you know, it was actually said in an email that reminded me of the term social-emotional learning and, you know, how the academic access, again, what we just showed, the academic success that our <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8941.073s">our</a> students have when they are in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8944.575s">So</a> that's sort of where my now new concern is with the stipend positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8949.037s">I</a> appreciate there's money being put there, however, that condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8952.9s">That</a> also translates to the Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8954.44s">I</a> was talking to some of my former teachers, which is crazy to think that, you know, seeing them here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8960.724s">I</a> was reminded by one of my teachers that was pregnant when I had them, and they showed me a photo of their 16-year-old son. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8967.187s">And</a> it made me just really, really think back to the time that I was there, and it was the Missittuc, really concerned at the number of positions that's being cut there, especially, you know, a lot of people had said that the class sizes aren't what are as advertised, that we have a lot of staff members really doing the part of their job description that's other duties is assigned, covering for each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8987.018s">And</a> how many of our, you know, language learning students <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8992.021s">are</a> there and how we are cutting down at a school where we send a lot of people who need maybe extra aid there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8998.285s">And</a> so that's a huge concern of mine, and one that I wanted to echo from the thousands of comments and people who are here today to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9007.63s">I</a> feel like there's definitely some more comments that have definitely been reshared, so I won't go through some of that, but I just want to, again, thank everyone who's here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9014.913s">And</a> thank you, Jerry, for, again, being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9017.575s">I</a> know this isn't easy to do, and I appreciate being able to look at the numbers and see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9023.7s">But</a> those are sort of some of my high-level concerns, so thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10038.951s">Point</a> of clarification before we move on.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10043.493s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10044.453s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10045.734s">I</a> just wanted to not to stir the pot, but in reference to student members' wrongs with the payroll managerial positions, I think there was some also concern from the union about those usually being administrative assistant roles and then them being non-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10059.538s">Is</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10060.718s">still</a> a proposed effort? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10062.901s">I</a> just want to get clarification if that's changed.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12369.626s">Point</a> of clarification, vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12371.707s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12373.948s">I</a> know that we made a motion earlier to strike the addresses of our student members in the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12379.51s">Would</a> it make sense to suspend the rules or make a motion to strike the students who have to speak further to give their address when they speak at the podium for minutes or?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12395.459s">I</a> just want to clarify and make that note to the students that they don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12399.582s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.043s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.603s">They</a> have your name and address for the record.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18552.759s">point</a> of clarification, is this number with all the cuts or without the cuts?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18560.465s">So</a> this number that we're putting forward is a request to the municipal government.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18569.773s">It's</a> a request, but it is the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18573.516s">What</a> I should clarify in my clarification is, is this number, because I'm getting confused with the language again, I'm on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18582.362s">Is</a> this number one that reflects the cuts in our packet or is this one that is the level one that is? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18589.526s">This</a> is level service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18590.847s">This</a> is level service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18591.788s">If</a> we do not, so this does not include the cutting of the director of performing arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18595.751s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18596.751s">That's</a> all I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18598.012s">Yes,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18601.213s">It's</a> very important to know what we vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18605.754s">Everyone</a> else understands what we're voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18607.854s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18608.134s">I</a> do not feel comfortable voting on a budget that has this many cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18611.115s">But</a> if this number that we are putting forward, then yes, the bottom number, not the top number.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18713.874s">Can</a> you turn on your mic? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18714.935s">Yes,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18716.897s">So</a> point of clarification for the fifth time, recommendation on the consent agenda, we did not vote to recommend to approve the $3,000 grant.<h2><a href="../2024-05-09_8X8NZBlcbA8/2024-05-09_8X8NZBlcbA8.html">Ad Hoc Handbook Review</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=0.393s">Yes,</a> yep, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2.955s">OK,</a> we are live on YouTube, and let me record it locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=8.099s">Record</a> to the cloud. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=11.141s">And</a> make host. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=15.344s">All</a> right, have a great meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=16.325s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=18.126s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=64.031s">I</a> can read it out for you if you'd like.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=72.426s">Sure,</a> so the meeting ID is 91810757989, with the Zoom meeting link being mps02155-org.zoom.us, forward slash J, forward slash 918177, 757, sorry, 989.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=805.94s">Yeah,</a> so quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=807.101s">So</a> I guess it's more of like a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=810.6s">I'm</a> assuming this is sort of the point the school council's made up of like students, staff, faculty, is this the point for them to kind of give their feedback on like, we're finding that this isn't working or this like we've noticed this uptake in this and we need to do something about it like is this the community's chance to sort of
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.79s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.971s">Yeah,</a> because I guess I'm more thinking about when the users of the handbook can give feedback on what they're seeing made, like when that period would be essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=925.214s">And</a> I wasn't sure if that was the time for it or not.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1335.228s">Could</a> we say singular complete approval, meaning it's a, like, it has to be complete, a complete approval of a singular handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1343.551s">Could</a> that phrasing just before approval, make sense, or is there like some caveat.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1364.334s">I</a> guess I mean, singular, complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1370.816s">By</a> singular, I mean, like, this is the McGlynn handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1373.257s">This</a> is the Brooks handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1374.478s">If</a> we approve one of them, that is a singular, complete approval.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1387.034s">Yeah,</a> that's a good message, really, really good.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2938.873s">Okay,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2941.514s">Thing</a> I have to notice, which is the typo on phase 3.2 mandatory.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2953.52s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2954.702s">Oh,</a> I googled it just in case I didn't understand linguistics for a second, but member member and Tapa has been finding Dory.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2974.787s">Google</a> Docs does it automatically.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2987.383s">I</a> mean, the timeframe seemed logistical to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2989.685s">I</a> appreciate the cushion to an RN of like, hey, if these things need to get moved back, ours is significant so that way we're the ones who are kind of paid to do the work and can kind of speed things along if we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3002.857s">But</a> like in my experience of drafting policy and drafting <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3007.936s">Dates,</a> we did it with elections with our student council and like, it was like, it looked great on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3013.362s">It's</a> like, this makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3014.443s">And</a> then they just executed the constitute the new constitution this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3018.146s">And</a> it was like, no, we need to, we need to do this a lot earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3020.789s">So</a> it'll be something we live and learn that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3025.594s">But</a> logistically, having a month for initiation.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3255.519s">I</a> don't really have any further questions or comments.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3512.205s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3514.205s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3764.85s">No,</a> that sounds about right to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3766.211s">If</a> it's outside of the time we're dialoguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3768.293s">But</a> no, that does make sense to amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3770.675s">But</a> right, if this was April 28th, we'd be having a different conversation, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3776.239s">In</a> fact, it's May 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3777.3s">I</a> think we're OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3780.363s">That's</a> my sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3783.288s">But</a> I didn't even think about that, member Ratcliffe. <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3785.189s">Thank</a> you for bringing that up, because that would have been fun.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3863.684s">We</a> just got an email saying that we have them and that physical copies will be given to us.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3871.672s">Yeah,</a> no, like, like literally 20 minutes ago, we got the three of them, and we will be giving hard copies out for the May 20 meeting.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5581.922s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5582.532s">And</a> it's just, it's not even just the high school, it's the elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5584.552s">I've</a> been taking medications since elementary school, um, elementary school, middle school and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5589.513s">Um,</a> and so that, that doesn't really change. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5591.434s">So</a> it was always packed to even back then when I was there in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5596.455s">Um,</a> so I'm really, really concerned about how many, you know, employees were cutting, uh, in terms of athletics, um, that department in terms of it's already thin enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5605.636s">And</a> I, I'm not sure what position was cut in the athletics department.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5613.299s">One</a> of the administrative?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5616.46s">Because</a> the assistant athletic director that I know that's in there is like the backbone of that entire athletics department. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5622.582s">And</a> that is no diss to anyone in that department at all, but the individual who is in that is at everything I've ever been to and is there to make sure that that program stays running. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5640.676s">So</a> really looking at, you know, it's numbers but it's also people and support, and who are they going to lean on if they're the ones there all the time anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5648.659s">And</a> then in terms of, you know, looking at technology spending, we've sort of digged ourselves into this hole of relying on Chromebooks and technology because of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5658.716s">I</a> guess when it comes to technology, as someone who's used that technology pre-pandemic, knowing how unreliable it can be, I'm a little concerned about pumping more money into it until we figure out a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5668.419s">Because</a> I feel like every other Chromebook had a missing key. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5671.56s">And</a> also, I'm a little concerned about putting so much money towards tablets for kindergartners instead of the support that they need to help teach those kindergartners. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5687.236s">hands-on</a> learning tactile that, I mean, I'm not an educator, but I just happen to be a designer and an artist and know just the value of tactile hands-on learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5696.682s">And</a> I would almost rather look, see that money, if that money had to go towards something, be more towards school supplies or hands-on learning than electronics. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5704.167s">And</a> I don't know how that makes me sound, but I don't feel like our kindergartners need tablets, they need people. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5711.112s">And</a> so that's a lot of what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5713.193s">And</a> there's a lot of things, obviously, you know, I'm happy to see more increase in special education services. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5719.517s">But</a> there are a lot of alarming factors that I don't know if I fully wrapped my head around in the last 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5726.3s">And,</a> you know, thank you to everyone who's here to speak on behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5729.602s">And</a> I'm sorry by taking up more of the time that doesn't allow you to. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5733.98s">I</a> just wanna say that there's, I may have more questions or comments going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5738.304s">For</a> now, that's what I have, so thank you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5816.839s">Right,</a> and I think, I'm sorry, just a point of clarification, I guess on my point, is it to cut technology? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5821.321s">It's</a> more to look at and consult our users who are administering it to see where they might find it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5826.463s">Do</a> we need to invest more in technology? <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5828.363s">I</a> don't have a teaching degree, so I don't really know what that is like, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5833.625s">definitely</a> leaning more on our professionals that are our faculty to see where there are technological gaps and fixes on a day-to-day classroom basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5841.527s">So</a> thank you for the clarification as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5844.108s">Again,</a> appreciate the work.<h2><a href="../2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc/2024-04-30_RAMzOXnU5sc.html">4.29.2024 Medford School Committee Regular Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6390.369s">Thank</a> you very much Chair Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6396.392s">Yeah</a> I just wanted to put this motion forward to sort of recognize and also I guess more amend our current calendar so I know we have we take a vote in November to put forward days of observance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6408.58s">I</a> also want to clarify <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6410.185s">This</a> is not a day off holiday I'm looking to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6413.147s">It</a> is more of a day of observance, day of acknowledgement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6416.71s">Currently</a> as it stands, the last calendar I had checked, it is referred to as Autism Awareness Day, Autism Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6424.636s">And</a> this motion looks to amend that and to change that language, whether it has to get tabled till November or if we can do it right now, which would be preferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6433.943s">So</a> it's where it's already labeled and where it needs to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6440.663s">The</a> third part of the motion, the clarification about identifying students is how we're looking at how we are screening, screening techniques, as well as looking at ways that parents can come to us as a district to look at receiving services, however, they may need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6462.592s">This</a> is something that I would like in writing and to sort of get a report on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6465.774s">I</a> have a personal, this comes from a, and the explanation kind of talks about it, of looking at how we make change and how we are impacted as a former student in the Medford Public Schools with an IEP who belongs in the neurodivergent community on the spectrum of the attention deficit disorder spectrum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6487.623s">This</a> is something that I witnessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6490.359s">I</a> witnessed students who had 504s and IEPs, their struggles, how some of them would lose them because they were doing better, which to me makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6500.322s">Because</a> if you're doing better on a plan, you're doing better because of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6504.022s">It</a> helps you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6506.163s">So,</a> I'm really looking to see what we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6509.284s">And</a> this is sort of the 1st kind of steps and looking at how we as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6515.222s">can</a> become allies within the autistic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6517.803s">I'd</a> like to make another point of, um, the use of disorder, um, uh, is not so popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6524.906s">And</a> my apologies for using the official language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6527.867s">Um,</a> but also, um, you know, this really, really comes from, um, my personal experience working with those, um, within the autistic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6537.611s">Um,</a> as my buddy Dan puts it best, it's pretty easy for me to make you aware that I have autism and that usually proceeds to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6544.868s">But</a> it's really hard for members of the community to accept me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6549.051s">And</a> I would like to mitigate that harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6552.833s">We're</a> talking at a higher education level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6554.934s">Mitigate</a> the harmful effects that this has on our students before they even get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6560.998s">And</a> as someone who's been looked at funny and scrutinized because of my diagnosis, this is my way of putting steps forward for better allyship. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6572.994s">But</a> we also want to look at the success. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6574.895s">We</a> want to look more at the success, not so much as a disease needs to be healed, as mentioned in the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6581.718s">But</a> I feel like we can't do that until we look at how we are helping and how we are aiding the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6587.861s">So</a> that is all I have on the motion.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6722.801s">Yeah,</a> I think, thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent for bringing to your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6728.565s">I</a> think that's what I'm just looking to see is what are the procedures we have to follow? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6735.409s">That's</a> really, I'm sorry if the phrasing is, this is my first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6739.912s">My</a> apologies if the phrasing is weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6742.947s">But</a> yeah, I'm looking to see what protocols are from DESE.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6769.742s">Yeah,</a> that would be good as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6771.704s">I</a> would say a better method would be reports to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students on the autism spectrum, due to just recommendations from the community on language surrounding how we address it.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6918.559s">Yes,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6920.099s">That</a> would be great to have that conversation with CPAC as well as bring that to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6925.702s">And</a> also to answer, sorry, to answer the question at hand of the school's calendars to reach the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6934.866s">Yes,</a> it would amend it to where it is already written to where that to where days of observance are listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6942.289s">Because</a> it has also been brought point of singling out 1 holiday is a concern, which I fully understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6948.391s">So,</a> wherever this would naturally be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6952.153s">Written</a> is where we would like to see it amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6957.068s">So</a> yes, all recommendations of amendment are taken into consideration for the motion.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9366.206s">Thank</a> you Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9367.746s">I</a> would just like to, I've realized the point was more on the lines of the question of Member Branley, but I would like to echo the point made by MTA President Guillen, as well as Chair Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9384.41s">It</a> does feel a little politician heavy, and I would love to see if we do have a non-voting member addition, because again, the guidelines said one, minus, you know, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9395.956s">You</a> know, the 2 being, you know, member Graham and member. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9400.639s">And</a> this is no, this is with all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9404.281s">This</a> is not a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9405.642s">I</a> want to make that very clear member. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9407.363s">So</a> it was a very, very intelligent person, especially when it comes to open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9413.347s">I</a> have I use it as a resource for many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9416.069s">It's</a> just a matter of me wanting to have more of our community members who maybe don't have that say that maybe this board would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9425.177s">And</a> including, especially our teachers, whether that be paraprofessionals, whether that be the people who walk those buildings daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9435.782s">Because</a> they will tell you the ins and outs that evolve every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9441.745s">So,</a> yeah, I would say that, you know, obviously it's 2 different motions, but I would echo the concerns of chair and would probably want to put to get more 4 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9451.786s">I</a> don't know what the legality of having teachers that don't live in our district, because from my understanding, we have quite a few teachers who don't live within the Medford Public Schools who may be eligible to want to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9462.631s">I</a> don't know the legality of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9464.252s">That's</a> just my own ignorance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9466.873s">But</a> if we can open up it to having more than one school member, even as a non-voting member, I don't see why we couldn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9477.318s">But</a> I think that's all the collective thought I have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9482.216s">before</a> I just start talking nonsense.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9546.716s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9738.281s">I</a> think the point is, is that member Graham in presenting was saying about how MSBA may have a cap of a certain amount of the working groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9748.267s">The</a> idea was, is that we approve three, and if we need to cut down to one non-voting member, then we look at the pool of who we want to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9755.591s">The</a> idea is to have three, and if we can have two, then we have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9758.193s">And</a> if we have three, then we can have three.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9798.156s">I'd</a> second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9799.397s">Could</a> I add on to that in the statement that they should be priority sent to faculty members of the building that is being built?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9815.861s">Right,</a> right, from that pool, yes, from the applicant pool.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9820.343s">Okay,</a> thank you.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=694.345s">If</a> I could chime in, because I remember if I'm correct, if the students can correct me, the current policy is there's a square chart in front of every door that says the bag can't be bigger than this, that you're allowed to carry around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=706.733s">Is</a> that still the policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=707.754s">Because</a> that's how it was in 2019.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=715.234s">Yeah,</a> because I know the struggle like I when I was a seat when I was there, my floor was C2 and even C2 to be 3 was kind of crazy between classes with the 3 minute a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=728.885s">And</a> I can't even imagine what the class below us, which I think was C1, I think 2020 class was C1 or C3. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=736.571s">Because</a> I know that's where the struggle was always talked about was with transporting stuff but now it's member or so as mentioned with most students having school issue devices like the Chromebooks, it's, it's an issue of carrying so many objects but also the fragility of if you drop that you're going to get charged if it breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=754.719s">So</a> I think it definitely would be worth having a discussion, especially with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=760.117s">especially</a> making sure we have students who know that experience of getting from, again, dramatically from C1 to B3, seeing what that is like and where the struggles are and if we need to, how big we need to expand that policy or if we need to talk about just regular backpacks or if we, you know, I think the allocated size is only <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=785.327s">It's</a> like eight by 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=787.068s">It's</a> some weird like basic purse size, I think, if I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=793.753s">So</a> it definitely would be worth, again, because of the new added responsibility of maintaining that piece of technology, it would be definitely worth relooking at in terms of making sure that that can be done safely and effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=814.073s">So</a> I would be interested, as a note, as a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=818.999s">Also,</a> like with an added element of the petition to see student comments specifically about what their specific struggles are so we can self identify right off the bat, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=827.209s">So</a> when that petition goes out, I'd be I'd be curious to see what the specific needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=833.959s">Because</a> I don't want to try to solve a problem that no one has and waste so much energy on something that's like, no, we don't have this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=841.185s">It'd</a> be great to see what, like to hear from y'all what that is specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=846.589s">Is</a> it timing that's causing the issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=848.871s">Is</a> it amount of stuff you have to hold? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=852.214s">It</a> may be evident, but I would like to know specifically just so that way we can work efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=859.676s">to</a> design a solution to this issue that you guys are facing to the point where a petition does have to go out and we do have to have this conversation.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1140.854s">Could</a> another, you know, we talked about informational hierarchy and informational services would another element of this of the interest of the students would be of, I hate to use the word life hacks but other suggested ways of cutting down time between classes of like past precedents of what other students have found effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1158.53s">Like,</a> I know that doesn't, it's not meant to be proposed as a cop-out of reforming the policy, but in addition to looking at the policy, would students find it helpful for there to be some kind of information on what other, you know, students, alumni have found effective to go between? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1173.842s">Like,</a> I know for me, my cheat was that I always had my locker set to the first two, and then I could set it to the third and pull it and go, which isn't the safest option sometimes, and I learned it from a TV show on Nickelodeon when I was eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1188.192s">And</a> that's the classified. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1189.512s">But</a> something like that where it's like where people find opportune times in their schedule, where people, because once I had a rhythm going, I knew what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1198.054s">But</a> that was bestowed upon me by another peer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1202.134s">So</a> if they don't have that, so would an informational suggestion be of other usage to the students, essentially? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1209.776s">In</a> addition to re-looking at the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1211.896s">But</a> I wouldn't want to exclude that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1214.656s">Informational</a> sharing is a beautiful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1218.823s">Just</a> curious if that would be of interest as well.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1296.256s">No,</a> that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1296.976s">Thank</a> you for sharing.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2258.123s">Yeah,</a> I think that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2260.085s">Meeting</a> with Mr. Guillaume, Mr. Green is also at a former position was also a proofreader so he'll be able to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2267.952s">If</a> there's anything that he feels like should be added as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2271.996s">I</a> love how much thought has gone into this, especially I think I heard someone I think might have been knows like quantifiers in terms of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2281.366s">missing</a> homework, especially on snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2283.988s">And</a> then, you know, at what point do we go, okay, we kind of need to start instruction back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2288.852s">I</a> think that's an incredible thought to be brought into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2294.116s">I</a> did have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2295.237s">There</a> was a comment made about homework assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2301.502s">Is</a> our, backtracking for one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2307.848s">Was</a> a point made, has this been happening where <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2311.323s">faculty</a> members will assign homework like way after hours to be completed for the following day is that what that was referring to where like homework will be assigned at like four or 5pm to then be completed during the school day is that like I don't want to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2328.194s">you</a> know, into something if that's not the case, but is that, was that, is that a reoccurring thing that's been happening?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2371.892s">I</a> gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2372.373s">So</a> it's more of looking to, especially in those lecture hall, which are usually like the last worst case scenario situations of having the work be assigned so that way you're not sitting there playing with playing cards and just kind of doing other classwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2385.88s">It's</a> in that instruction period where your mind is set to work on <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2391.147s">American</a> history to be working on a push homework essentially is what the thought is with that so it's more about that and less of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2398.617s">you're</a> getting an email at 4pm that saying hey this is actually doing eight now okay just just checking to see what that was I wasn't sure what was going on, so I appreciate the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2408.646s">But</a> overall, a lot of thought has been going into this, and I really appreciate the research that's done with the National Parents Union, within district and local wide, within quantifiers looking at, sometimes there may be certain situations where, thinking about the faculty member, if there is an extreme case in their end, they may just not be able to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2429.684s">So</a> the understanding of working with people, I'm talking in circles right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2437.53s">overall</a> just really appreciate the work that's being done and looking forward to seeing what will be presented in the discussions we're having.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3124.434s">So</a> in terms of pick up, I don't recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3129.945s">So</a> drop off to the school, I don't recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3132.606s">I</a> drove or got driven in full transparency in terms of hiccup. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3139.369s">The</a> side where community schools is where that like stone courtyard is, that is what we're talking about in terms of like students funneling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3147.472s">It's</a> always been a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3148.493s">I</a> remember students like standing on the hills. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3151.834s">They</a> used to line up on the hills and try to balance themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3155.595s">But</a> also in terms of the buses, I am a victim of the North Medford Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3162.726s">I</a> live in the North Medford Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3164.347s">I</a> live right on the border of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3166.108s">So</a> if I had to take the bus home, I was on the yellow school bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3171.292s">So</a> I also know that and that picking up at a way different location was always weird to me of why that picks up by the Vogue automotive shop where the MBTA buses pick up at the community schools entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3184.491s">So</a> yeah, it's always been crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3186.153s">It's</a> always, I don't, I never viewed it as a safety issue at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3191.457s">So</a> I don't, I haven't been up there during drop off. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3194.26s">So</a> I don't know if it's getting worse in terms of like people just not knowing where to stand, how it looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3198.824s">It</a> sounds like from the student representatives that it is getting a lot worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3203.087s">So</a> if we can figure out ways to <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3206.471s">channel</a> students to understand where to go or if the line gets too long where to wrap around and make sure you're still in the same line of the 95 versus the 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3216.355s">But</a> yeah, also wanted to give my thanks for this for the students who are working on this issue because it has always been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3223.938s">It</a> was an issue when I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3225.319s">It</a> sounds like the safety part is a bigger issue that I had never heard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3231.522s">So</a> thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3233.926s">But</a> yeah, the whole the North Medford bus is a whole nother issue with the MBTA not offering their services really up in our, our neck of the woods, so.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3710.814s">No,</a> I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3712.035s">Like</a> I said, my, my education, my background is in user interface user experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3718.357s">How</a> do we tell people what the information is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3724.2s">So</a> I'm looking, I'm looking at it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3725.76s">That's</a> why I'm on my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3728.401s">I</a> love the color coding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3729.782s">I'm</a> just going to like <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3732.643s">The</a> fact that we're talking about state level changes how that because what this does is it does a great job of how you know how would you connect the mass legislature to an elementary school, like, how does that work that feedback gets there and this is a really good job of showing how this actually goes through the channels and the ways we need to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3754.076s">definitely</a> support having this in terms of on the school committee website in terms of how student voices are heard, and how that process happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3764.863s">Because</a> it also helps empower the students to show that you know your voice does matter and sometimes that can be hard to convince students of how. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3771.727s">you</a> know, even at student government level, like, why does it matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3774.969s">Why</a> does it matter what I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3776.03s">Nothing</a> gets changed anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3777.031s">Well,</a> this is how it matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3778.612s">This</a> is how it goes up the ranks and we work together and we get what we need to be done changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3785.216s">So</a> I really applaud you all for taking the time to actually take a lot of complex information and ideas and put it into a very visual, very visual chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3797.604s">So</a> thank you for doing that.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7180.711s">For</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7181.091s">Thank</a> you, Director Schulman for presenting all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7184.053s">I</a> guess the first question is a clarification on the STEPS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7190.836s">It's</a> very similar to the BRIDGE program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.457s">It's</a> like our chapter of like we've renamed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7195.779s">Exactly</a> right.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7198.22s">that's</a> huge, and that's proven in other districts to really help a lot of our youth, especially, well, not our youth, but it is, seems to be helping our youth, but youth in other districts, especially as the mental health crisis and epidemic, as people were calling it, is increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7217.708s">And</a> we saw that in an increase in numbers, and then, you know, we're slowly seeing them come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7224.631s">In</a> terms of tier one, tier two, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7227.972s">two</a> and tier three in terms of, I noticed that, was it suicide screening and prevention was on all tiers and different approaches with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7237.839s">How</a> are we approaching it at a tier one versus a tier three?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7244.883s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7245.864s">And</a> then love to see that a lot of things were starting in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7249.866s">I</a> was curious to hear about some of the things that were starting in elementary school in terms of, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7255.797s">sort</a> of education with this, because obviously you don't want to like put all these topics on elementary schoolers, but I know I was a student who suffered with severe anxiety and was put into therapy as a third grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7268.464s">And</a> a lot of that was the unknown of what I was feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7271.926s">So</a> I'm curious to see, there's two parts to this, curious to see where we're going in terms of possibly seeing in some soft integration of possible mental health education within our elementary schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7285.734s">because</a> that can be one of the scariest parts of when you're eight, you don't know what's happening, why you feel a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7292.419s">I</a> know that was certainly the case for me, as well as looking at, and we talked about it, I believe you talked about a little bit in the program about the self-reliance skills, not self-reliance, but it was social and emotional learning outside of the classroom and looking at other programs, sort of, I know that some universities are adapting <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7311.909s">Things</a> like headspace subscriptions for students, you know, obviously institutionally wide but maybe for us case by case basis ways for students to learn how to I hate to use the word deal with these things but off hours of how students are able to get support and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7330.134s">Because</a> a lot of these issues are still stigmatized. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7333.639s">There's</a> still an issue of why are you stressed, you're 13, what's going on, what's stressing you out so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7339.106s">But</a> for a lot of these students, it really is a huge, huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7345.013s">So</a> curious to see the direction possibly we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7348.965s">of</a> out-of-class help, support and resources, you know, even just like a brochure of phone lines to call if you're feeling this way in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7356.211s">Who</a> do you get into contact with? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7358.673s">Because</a> I don't, again, I've only been out of the public schools for five years now, but I don't ever remember seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7365.198s">Maybe</a> it's because I didn't need the resources at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7368.04s">But</a> that also says I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7371.621s">Or</a> I am under the impression of, I feel like this information should be present without needing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7377.684s">Like</a> we should have these ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7379.705s">It</a> should be nowhere to go before we even need to, you know, think about the bridge program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.067s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.467s">So</a> that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7386.768s">But</a> I guess the two, the too long didn't read of all that is looking at possible integration with, you know, the elementary school, seeing where we're at in terms of screening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7396.974s">because</a> that's also where I was screened for ADD, and that really helped set me up for my further education, as well as the, as it's put in the report, social-emotional learning integration throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7410.657s">So</a> where we're at with that?
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7484.335s">Yeah,</a> and I guess the more part of like, I know this would probably be more for high school or would integrate starting in the high school, but again, that looking at other programs outside of the classroom for students to access, whether it's a portal online or even like, again, like a brochure of resources outside of the Medford Public Schools that they may utilize, looking at integration of that as well within this.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7535.99s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7536.37s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7537.051s">Really</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8777.57s">Yes,</a> thank you, Director Zahara for coming and giving all these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8782.013s">I'd</a> be interested to see at some point sort of our statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8787.057s">I</a> know this probably pertains more to our high school students who come in as English language learners with their sort of integration into the arts and athletic departments and how they are sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8799.94s">coexisting</a> in those spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8801.86s">I</a> know that at least my time at the high school, it always seemed very sectioned off in terms of not just academics, but also in terms of culture, like the culture of just leisure and existing in these spaces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8819.944s">And</a> that's really unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8823.065s">Even</a> at, we had a lot of EL students participate as stage crew, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8828.736s">And</a> the drama club and they always stuck together and we're off by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8833.921s">And</a> I'd love to find out if there's a way that we can minimize that culture of things I mean it's a very scary thing of. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8842.881s">you</a> know, learning linguistics and settling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8845.363s">And</a> for some of these individual students, there was an individual who was on the crew team with member Olapade and I, who had just landed in the US in Somerville their first year, and we met them their second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8860.111s">And</a> they didn't know the word for screwdriver. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8862.553s">And</a> then by the end of it, you know, they were, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8867.014s">The</a> growth that we witnessed with that individual because of how integrated they were and how socialized they were with us and how the program really benefited them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8876.644s">It</a> was a really beautiful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8877.665s">So</a> I'd love to see sort of what we're doing as a As a <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8886.758s">division,</a> I don't know the right word, at the moment to push students to sort of more coexist together because it's benefit for both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8895.66s">It's</a> benefit for all involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8897.84s">So</a> I'd love to see that at some point.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8920.928s">Love</a> to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8921.549s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9691.252s">Sorry,</a> my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9692.312s">Thank</a> you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9694.353s">I</a> share a similar concern with Premier Reinfeld about section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9698.874s">Each</a> new member will present to the committee secretary official certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9702.175s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9703.604s">I'm</a> not sure where else it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9706.947s">But</a> to me, I feel like this as someone who just went through the process of policy not existing and policy being vacant and a week of anxiety around what happens next. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9721.438s">This,</a> I, it almost, it, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9726.519s">I</a> don't want to say it feels unnecessary, because I appreciate the work that's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9729.802s">But</a> I don't see what the committee secretary has to do with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9734.407s">And</a> again, that could just be my naiveness of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9736.87s">I'm</a> two weeks into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9740.173s">But</a> to me, I feel like striking almost this from the policy, I don't see it's <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9750.592s">Like</a> you said, less is more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9751.853s">And</a> to me, again, if we have a total rehaul of our school committee, which could happen, what does this do? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9757.738s">And</a> what happens then? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9760.42s">But</a> I would almost move to have, like the rest of the policy, very understandable, makes sense, especially the Massachusetts Ethics Commission summary of the common interest law, making sure we're up to date on that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9772.29s">However,</a> section two, to me, feels almost like it could be striking out of this policy.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9919.319s">I</a> was going to say, because I believe that is the protocol we had to follow, was we had to present the certification of election, or in my case, appointment to the city clerk.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10619.699s">I</a> was just gonna say, does a motion to amend need to be put on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10623.382s">Because</a> I can do that right now, is what I'm asking.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10666.678s">have</a> the channel links, but to have the community media link, the YouTube link, as well as the channel numbers, because again, it helps if you're trying to watch that on the TV.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10681.284s">Channel</a> numbers and YouTube, correct, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10683.625s">So</a> that would be my motion to amend, would be to strike that and include channel numbers and YouTube link.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10814.652s">Then,</a> yeah, with that, that information makes complete sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10817.775s">Then</a> I would move to make a motion to amend and just have the YouTube link on the <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10823.576s">agenda</a> circling back thousands of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10825.899s">But</a> if the if we can't rely on the channels being consistent, even if they're next to each other, we do open ourselves up to that liability of, again, false advertising, where the it's being broadcasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10837.631s">So</a> I was thinking from a standpoint of people who may not have smart TVs, maybe using, you know, the educational platform, but then again, we don't want to run into that issue.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11752.087s">If</a> I can, I'd like to waive my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11753.348s">I</a> believe a member of the public would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11755.771s">So</a> if I can waive out of order and then circle back, because I don't know if I have some questions about impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11762.696s">So</a> if the member of the public has any answers about that, I can reassess my questions, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11770.703s">So</a> I waive my time.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11955.386s">Well,</a> first off, I just want to thank you for coming forward and sharing your story. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11959.949s">That's</a> not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11961.13s">And</a> I apologize that that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11965.179s">My</a> question surrounded the effectiveness of what we're proposing, but it almost sounds like we need to take a reassessment of what we look at in terms of the disciplinary practice of suspension looking at the cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11982.478s">and</a> also just to do the work looking at the claim of who's being affected higher in terms of suspension rates, as you had mentioned with IEP students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11996.128s">So</a> my questions have greatly shifted, but I'm wondering where we have to look at, reassess the language and to see what fits in best practice.<h2><a href="../2024-03-14_di3OGRzz05w/2024-03-14_di3OGRzz05w.html">3.13.2024 MSC FY25 Budget Committee of the Whole</a></h2>
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=44.356s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=47.277s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=48.018s">I</a> don't know what's going on, but I'll just go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=50.499s">It's</a> fine.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4118.359s">No,</a> I was just gonna, to member, thank you, to member Rousseau's point of the Cummings Foundation, that large grant funds the CCSR over an expanded amount of time, so that might be why, and I don't know if they have to give it back, but I do know they have to apply, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4136.903s">every</a> 10 years or so, it's like somewhere between six to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4142.005s">But</a> I was curious about the gift fund and if that had any in time in with the alumni association and where those funds are handled, where the overflow of SGA funds from the previous classes, I know some of them, sometimes they're retained, sometimes the SGA funds <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4163.977s">go</a> into like the alumni association so that way they can do their own private scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4167.858s">So</a> I'm curious to see how much of that may be attributing to that, if at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4173.919s">Or</a> if it's purely outside, if it's purely outside donations of people who wanna give back to our schools.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4189.943s">I</a> know, my apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4191.673s">figure</a> out my mic, but I would be interested to see where the MHS gift fund, what is funding that, if it's anything with the alumni association, if it's in terms of like overflow of SGA funds, the student government funds with fundraised funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4208.978s">And</a> then the beginning point, again, I don't know how much was heard, fixing my mic situation for next meeting about the Cummings Foundation being a grant that's spent over a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4218.581s">And</a> I think we're actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4220.749s">in</a> year one or year two of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4222.59s">I</a> think it was just replenished, which might be why that number is so large, but that is the predominant funding source for all of the units of CCSR and all the projects.

 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=50.211s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=50.651s">So</a> my name is John Lewis Intoppa. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=53.394s">I</a> use he him pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=55.036s">I</a> am from Medford, Mass, born and raised in the North Medford Heights. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=59.64s">I</a> am a returning candidate from the 2019 election when I ran out of high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=66.186s">And</a> since then, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=68.145s">have</a> gone to college and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Industrial Design with a minor in Sculpture from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=77.167s">While</a> at MassArt, I had a very long career, well, all four years, basically, in student leadership, student development, and student engagement, from the dorms as an RA to the student body president to the board of trustees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=92.571s">So</a> I was huge in advocation with student rights, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=96.575s">and</a> making sure students had always a voice at the table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=101.218s">And</a> so I'm hoping, you know, the things that I was criticized for my age of 18 running back in 2019, learning all of that and having that experience has definitely shifted a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=115.529s">And</a> hopefully, you know, may persuade some people now that there's actual experience there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=123.521s">I'm</a> really looking forward to taking those skills and those trainings and applying it to Medford if possible.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=154.201s">So</a> I have a few. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=155.682s">So</a> a little bit about me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=159.044s">I</a> was born and still have a severe tree nut allergy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=162.686s">So</a> finding places to trust was always hard growing up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=165.987s">But</a> I will say that it depends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=170.15s">If</a> it's a night out, the Ford Tavern or Razo's is a go-to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=174.712s">Can't</a> beat Razo's Chicken Parm. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=176.393s">And</a> the Ford, I'm still getting used to their menu as I start to go there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=180.075s">But</a> they've been great with allergies and everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=183.827s">If</a> I'm looking for a casual bite, Iris Restaurant, Noe Tejada and that crew down in Haines Square has always been phenomenal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=193.009s">Back</a> when I worked at what was then Modern Hardware, they were always very accommodating for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=197.31s">And</a> then a special shout out to Colleen's because that was the only place I could eat hard ice cream growing up and still can only eat hard ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=205.872s">And</a> so it's like, I don't have to settle for soft serve everywhere I go, which really sucks when you're nine and out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=213.182s">you</a> know, after winning a baseball game at Gillis, it was always nice to go there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=217.983s">But</a> also shout out to those restaurants in particular, because most of them employ students from our school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=225.645s">And</a> so they actually, you know, give our students jobs, which is really nice.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=278.629s">So</a> the two joke answers but are very real. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=282.025s">to</a> that question is I told myself four years ago I would, and I don't like breaking promises. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=287.589s">And</a> I spent way too much money on signage to only use them once. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=291.773s">But</a> also, the real answer is that I approached it from the point of view as a high school student, senior class president, someone involved in athletics and arts and knew that student perspective. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=306.204s">And</a> then a lot of the criticism four years ago was, again, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=310.374s">experience.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=311.174s">It</a> was you had only had experience in those realms and it wasn't a lot of training and it was, it was good experience, but it wasn't what people wanted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=320.536s">So</a> then when I got to college, the election ran from when I graduated to like halfway through my fall semester. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=330.379s">And</a> when I lost, I tried to find opportunities because I was determined to run again on how I could <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=337.537s">get</a> those experiences and how I could fix that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=342.2s">And</a> so lucky for me, the student trustee position opened up at MassArt, which is, if people don't know, the board of trustees, student trustees, student trustees, an elected full trustee to the board of trustees by the students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=356.067s">And</a> the board of trustees is basically like the school committee of a university. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=360.789s">Instead</a> of the superintendent, it's the president. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=363.091s">They</a> make sure everything's in check. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=364.491s">They</a> value all that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=366.083s">So</a> it's a big thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=367.264s">It's</a> a big job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=368.405s">Um,</a> and I was still in go mode and went and put my hand in the race as a first year and I got it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=377.35s">Um,</a> and I was super psyched. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=378.851s">And</a> then that led into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=379.912s">Uh,</a> two terms on the board and then two terms later as, um, when we got a new president, it was determined that if I had switched to SGA president, that we could build a better relationship and that would, you know, add into the leadership role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=396.115s">Um,</a> and so basically kind of hand tailored and experience in college to not only benefit leadership and sort of amplify those skills, but also like knowing that in four years I wanted to return. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=408.678s">And</a> to be honest, I tried to return two years ago, but that's when I realized I wanted to run for president there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=413.88s">And</a> I went, I can't do both. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=416.24s">And</a> so I dropped out of the race before papers even be pulled. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=418.881s">It</a> wasn't, wasn't even official. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=420.601s">Um,</a> it was all hearsay, but, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=424.045s">So</a> it was those shared experiences and those initiatives that made me realize I was more prepared. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=431.35s">I</a> did a lot with the state and a lot of student advocacy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=436.053s">And</a> looking at platforms, there's a lot of great platforms out there between my competitors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=440.715s">It's</a> a tough race. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=441.456s">I</a> mean, last year was, four years ago was 10 people, but this is only eight, but it still feels more intense just because of how high level everyone's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=452.017s">you</a> know, thoughts are and what they can bring to the table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=455.318s">But</a> to me, I'm, with my experience, I'm the only one that can bring the focus on student experience aspect of it, because that's where I've, that's where my experience is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=469.483s">And</a> so I decided that I wanted to run because I wanted to have someone on there that had that mindset and could think that way to make sure that we're, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=481.403s">We're</a> taking that into effect and that's not saying no one everyone that's that's on the minds of everyone, but it's someone that specifically hones in on that aspect would be beneficial. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=490.832s">I</a> believe.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=536.946s">For</a> sure, so fun fact, Aaron and I actually were on the rowing team together and he actually graduated a year before me, same as Justin Tseng. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=546.693s">So</a> you got the class of 2018 and 2019 really in this election season. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=551.737s">But</a> yeah, no, there definitely is a more focus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=553.658s">And</a> I will say there is also an alarming lack of focus at the same time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=557.521s">When</a> we talk about violence in the schools, we've seen, you know, that was a huge thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=561.805s">And</a> it's not really my story to tell, but, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=567.26s">To</a> me, there was an alarming lack of response from some of the elected officials on that and what the expectations were in our schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=577.344s">But</a> for me, so my background is in industrial design, user experience, all of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=583.687s">No</a> one's asking what the students want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=586.808s">No</a> one's asking what they think and what they've seen and the culture that they've lived. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=591.831s">When</a> I was fighting for ALICE to be implemented four years ago, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=595.663s">it</a> was because that's what everyone, that's what my peers wanted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=599.244s">That's</a> what we thought was best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=600.844s">And</a> that's what we had put the research into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=602.425s">Um,</a> and there was a lot about, you know, not teaching, you know, not wanting students to learn how to fight or have that fear, but that experience of being in there, I can tell you that students were ready to, you know, with all the unfortunate school shootings going on, we're ready to fight or grab the nearest object at will. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=619.13s">I</a> know I was, um, and you don't know that unless you ask. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=622.791s">Um,</a> and there was a, a, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=625.248s">alarming</a> amount of not asking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=627.41s">So</a> we've really got to make sure we're catering towards the users. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=630.652s">And</a> then, you know, when we look at users, we think of parents, we think of students, administrators, we need to make sure everything's balanced. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=637.356s">So</a> I'm never going to like the platform right now, as it's developing, it's pretty vague, I'll be honest, because I haven't been able to ask yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=645.502s">What</a> aspects of this that people want, you know, do we know any mental health programs that we know that will cater towards our students better? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=653.107s">Do</a> we know all of this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=655.837s">And</a> so I just feel like they haven't, they've been, we've been talking about what can we do for the students? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=661.981s">What</a> can we do for the students? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=662.922s">But</a> the question hasn't been given to students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=664.703s">It's</a> been given to parents, guardians, caregivers, and they're just as important, obviously, but we need to ask them too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=672.528s">We</a> need to know what that culture is like behind those cinder block walls. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=675.69s">We</a> need to know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=677.191s">And</a> so I think that's still lacking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=678.993s">And</a> I think that with the experience I've had serving in a role that did just that, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=686.756s">I</a> can bring that to the table and hopefully make that welcoming environments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=690.559s">That</a> way students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=692.02s">Students</a> are not going to want to go to school if they don't feel welcomed and I want to make sure that we foster that sort of environment within the school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=698.626s">So</a> that way they know they can come to us and give these suggestions.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=777.736s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=779.097s">So,</a> student experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=782.682s">Student</a> experience is all about how can we set up students for their own success? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=789.707s">And</a> that's sort of the approach I took at MassArt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=791.909s">So,</a> for instance, as an RA, I wasn't taking people to visits or telling them exactly where to go, but I was giving them resources and uplifting that or even. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=803.298s">Um,</a> to give the example of like facilitated dialogues where two roommates can't get along, I'm not making the decision on the middle ground between the two of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=811.002s">You</a> know, it's, it's all about try to guide them towards making that themselves and you get a more beneficial react, um, a more beneficial, um, Experience experience out of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=825.85s">Um,</a> Jesus, how many times am I going to say experience today? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=828.971s">Um,</a> but, but it's, it's also like, kind of like how. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=833.12s">Um,</a> so I, you know, played baseball all of my, you know, younger life and then, you know, sort of, you know, had a love for it, but I didn't know if it was for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=841.204s">And</a> then when I joined rowing, I shot off with it, um, because it was something that I had, I had made that decision. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=847.326s">Um,</a> and so student experience really, to me is all about guiding our students to making those decisions and making those choices, because in the end. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=855.23s">It</a> may take more time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=856.982s">a</a> little more effort because it's easier just to say you're just going to go play soccer for the summer you're just going to go do this but if we can find a way to get those resources out there and accessible so they know what they can pick from. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=869.551s">I</a> mean that was the whole appeal of high school growing up was like oh my god I get to pick my classes I get to pick how I want this to go to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=878.677s">You</a> know in high school a lot of kids <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=880.708s">didn't</a> like high school, they wanted to drop out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=882.449s">It</a> was because like, this isn't for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=883.969s">I'm</a> not gonna use these skills. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=885.809s">I'm</a> not gonna benefit from this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=887.51s">And</a> how can we, we use that a lot in design is how can we, so my apologies again to that statement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=894.352s">That</a> will be a lot is how can we design that experience? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=897.813s">So</a> one, they feel welcomed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=899.833s">Two,</a> we're like, no, we're here to support you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=903.214s">We're</a> here to take you through this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=906.711s">but</a> also it's extracurricular, so paying attention to the arts and athletics as well as in the classroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=911.472s">We</a> need to make sure that they're getting to the classroom safe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=915.353s">We</a> need to make sure that when they're in our care, that it is a safe environment to learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=919.893s">And</a> it kind of goes back to that third question of if a student doesn't feel safe in a classroom, they're only gonna be focused on how they're not feeling safe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=929.655s">That</a> was me during Parkland. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=931.636s">That</a> was me during, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=934.402s">All</a> of these, the school shoots that happened when I was in high school was most of my time was spent trying to figure out how I'd get out of a classroom because I didn't feel safe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=945.045s">And</a> it was, we're talking miles away from Massachusetts, miles away from Medford, but there was all this in the news and it was unsure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=952.587s">And</a> it took away from that, that, that safe environment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=955.228s">And</a> I don't remember, you know, obviously I don't remember everything I learned in high school, but there were, there are pieces missing because of that anxiety of being there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=963.954s">So</a> if we're having students beat up in the hallways, we're having these things happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=971.779s">Education</a> to me is something that someone wants to have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=975.482s">We</a> talk a lot, I just got off of a fellowship where we talked a lot about growth mindset and what that means to have a growth mindset. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=984.388s">And</a> it's all about wanting to grow and to know that you may not be the best at this, but like, so what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=990.172s">Not</a> everyone's the best at everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=991.933s">And</a> it's easier said than done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=994.059s">But</a> how do we promote a culture where a student says, I'm not the best at math, but if I can't solve this equation by the beginning, but I can somehow manage to solve it by the end, then I'm satisfied. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1005.468s">We</a> need to know that our students don't need to be the top. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1007.91s">They</a> don't have to be the top at everything, because that just is an unnecessary stressor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1012.774s">But</a> if they want to be, then sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1014.396s">If</a> they want to pursue it, sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1018.153s">We</a> used it a lot in art school where it was like the professors were looking at if you started as someone who could paint like Van Gogh and ended like someone who could paint like Van Gogh, you failed the class because you didn't grow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1030.256s">You</a> didn't learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1031.256s">So</a> if you start the class with someone who doesn't understand 10 concepts, but you leave it understanding five, that's amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1040.158s">Good</a> for you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1040.818s">You've</a> gotten something out of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1043.999s">And</a> so that's sort of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1045.579s">And</a> education is where you want to learn <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1048.427s">You're</a> there to learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1051.19s">And</a> as it gets later on, it's more catered towards what you want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1054.734s">But</a> I think I'm talking in circles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1059.419s">That's</a> essentially what it means to me, at least.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1100.659s">Um,</a> for sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1103.22s">And</a> it's, yeah, I mean, for me, so, um, as a young attention deficit child growing up in the Medford public schools, um, if something didn't interest me, it immediately shut down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1115.064s">There</a> were moments where like, I didn't, um, there were certain classes, certain curriculum, certain things where if I didn't resonate or I couldn't find an interest in it, um, then I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1128.549s">It</a> didn't, you know, provoke that curiosity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1132.873s">And</a> that's a toughie because that is something that is a case-by-case basis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1138.197s">But</a> I've always found that, speaking about the teachers specifically, whenever I had those difficulties, I was able to self-advocate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1155.587s">which</a> was a skill I learned pretty young as someone with, you know, a disability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1161.268s">And</a> if, you know, when the teacher was right with the subject, and I had a lot of great teachers, I was very fortunate, they were able to sort, because of their kindness and way that they helped me learn it, it proved that importance, I guess. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1179.591s">But</a> I don't know if I have a specific answer on how we can fix it right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1183.332s">Like,</a> I don't know if I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1186.012s">can</a> think of a way to design a better experience in that sense where it's like, besides saying that we need, if we can't prove, if we can't convince the student that it should interest them, we should convince them why it's worth knowing at least in the slightest and sort of showing why, you know, sometimes things feel like busy work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1206.838s">So</a> students don't want to do it, but if we can show why it isn't, we're actually building this skill, being transparent about what we're trying to do, then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1213.178s">But</a> again, I'm not a teacher and I'm not a trained teacher, so I don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1216.601s">And</a> that'd be something to talk to the MTA about skills that they've learned and skills that they've done.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1282.984s">What</a> specifically that's a great question cuz again, yeah talking about those like thinking outside of the box and those building those cultures and perspectives and finding different points of view. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1297.263s">There</a> were some classes that promoted that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1300.266s">There</a> was something like, I'll take a shout out to Mr. Milne's psychology class, who also ran two years ago, Andrew Milne. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1309.396s">He</a> had us really think about what our stance was and how to back it up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1318.785s">and</a> he would question us, even if he agreed with it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1320.626s">And</a> he never told us if he agreed with it or not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1322.466s">That</a> was his thing, is he was like, I will never tell you what I agree with, what I don't agree with. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1325.748s">I'm</a> gonna push you to figure that out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1326.868s">In</a> fact, I had a class, sort of when you start to sort of challenge your inner dialogue, I had a class called Free Speech, Democracy, and Artists, and it was all about, and college was all about free speech and art, which is a huge topic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1341.073s">And</a> it was this thing where, and MassArt is a very liberal progressive college, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1348.76s">And</a> the teacher specifically assigned assignments where you had to defend right-wing conservatives because of their freedom of speech. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1356.103s">You</a> had to challenge what you thought was ethically correct and lawfully correct. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1359.845s">And</a> I thought that was like a really interesting balance of like trying to figure out how your head works and like, what does it mean by that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1369.79s">But</a> at the high school, middle school and elementary school level, I think exposure, you know, exposure to the arts <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1377.26s">different</a> perspectives of that sense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1378.601s">What</a> does it mean to be an artist? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1379.762s">What</a> does it mean to be a designer? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1381.804s">Asking</a> those questions early on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1383.745s">I</a> wish there was a more complicated exposure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1386.988s">I</a> mean, complicated answer that I could give in the moment besides exposure is the biggest thing we can do is showing what's out there in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1394.454s">Showing</a> out, you know, what we can do and finding an age appropriate level is also something that I know nothing about and would need to consult with people about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1402.981s">I'm</a> not going to pretend like I know when to introduce certain topics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1406.308s">Um,</a> but there are topics that need to be introduced that aren't introduced mental health, which was on the platform four years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1412.65s">I</a> don't see any development with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1414.851s">Um,</a> cause we're not even talking about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1416.791s">We're</a> not talking about all these stressful things and I hate to say it, but. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1420.952s">Um,</a> in a very interesting way to say our kids are going through it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1425.394s">They</a> are, especially during the pandemic, they were going through a pre pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1429.335s">I</a> saw it firsthand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1430.635s">I've</a> dealt with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1432.336s">Um,</a> and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1433.842s">we</a> needed to find a way to show that it was okay to not be okay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1437.285s">And</a> that, even that mindset wasn't even alive in the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1441.768s">And</a> so it's like a whole rehaul of what that experience is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1445.111s">But</a> I think I might be straying from the question a little too much, but I would say that what I noticed the most was it was Medford High was really starting to improve with the cultural clubs that were starting up and, you know, getting stronger, Asian clubs spreading, you know, you know, the culture and, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1463.538s">There</a> were a lot of great fairs that sort of we're able to get a glimpse of things into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1469.182s">Sometimes</a> I feel like when we don't understand something, it's because we haven't even gotten a small glimpse of what that might be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1474.865s">And</a> if there's a way to expose that, like I had no clue what rowing was and it ended up being my high school sport. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1482.49s">It</a> was because one, my music teacher, Ms. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1484.852s">Grant</a> said, Hey, there's a middle school program starting up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1488.454s">It's</a> really cool to watch. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1489.775s">And</a> I was like, she thinks that's cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1491.878s">why</a> don't I check it out? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1492.879s">And</a> then it was my whole thing from, you know, seventh to when I graduated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1497.722s">Um,</a> so I hate to say, I feel like I've strayed from the question, but I don't know if I have a proper answer besides exposure and, um, I guess letting people explore and trying to see what, you know, what we can do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1510.932s">If</a> people, you know, want to explore what it means, you know, what their mental health is, and we need to find the resources to do that safely and to make sure that we know what that means. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1518.338s">If</a> they want to start thinking more critically, or if they want to start, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1521.645s">Um,</a> looking at these, these, um, phenomenas that you've mentioned earlier, like we need to see, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1526.947s">Do</a> we have the, we can talk about these things and these things should be talked about, but do we have the expertise to make sure it's done appropriately? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1533.448s">Cause</a> it's one thing to talk about something, but if you don't have the people that actually know what they're talking about, you can do more damage than, than good essentially. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1542.991s">So</a> we need to make sure that it's, it's done introduced correctly and guided appropriately.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1623.108s">You</a> know what, let's put it like this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1626.591s">Say</a> I get elected. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1628.512s">I</a> serve two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1630.095s">And</a> then either life happens or whatever, and I can't do it again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1633.177s">And</a> it was like, what did he do in two years that was worth something? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1638.561s">I'm</a> all about building foundation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1640.703s">That's</a> my biggest thing, is how can we do the research? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1643.285s">And</a> that's what my role is, is before any product goes on the market, my role is to build that foundation for the engineers to take it and run with it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1652.231s">And</a> so I'd say for me, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1656.048s">getting</a> the conversation started, which we kind of did four years ago, but they've died off for obvious reasons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1661.771s">Some</a> other things, large things came up, a global pandemic, a pandemic hit, and a lot of focus shifted towards that.
 <p>[John Intoppa]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1683.469s">Letting</a> our students know it's okay to invest in the arts and what those benefits are without, you know, looking at a on a. On a less surface level, um. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1694.613s">What</a> mental health is and how it can show itself at very different ages. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1700.115s">Um,</a> and how the best, the more we know about it, the better and also the more we talk about it, the less of the stigma that there is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1709.098s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1710.659s">as</a> well as building a foundation for our students to build a foundation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1714.682s">One</a> of the words, the key phrases within the campaign is interdependence. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1718.605s">Cause</a> we want to, you know, give these skills to our students, but to build that vibrant community, they need to work with themselves and figure out, you know, how that works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1728.593s">Different</a> cultures come and go at least every four years within the buildings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1735.978s">And</a> so I'd say that if, if, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1739.093s">we</a> can take these high level skills and things that we can apply to the school committee to work better together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1745.095s">But</a> then the students look at that and look at us and go, okay, maybe we can figure out a way to, you know, build a better environment in our classrooms, you know, ourselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1755.178s">Um,</a> I think that'd be a beautiful, a very beautiful thing, um, just to spread more kindness and more, um, acceptance for some things that maybe seem taboo, like someone wanting to be an artist when they grow up and, um, or someone, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1767.879s">you</a> know, who has a bad day, but can't figure out why, you know, sometimes it just happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1775.984s">And</a> so, or, you know, I, you know, someone is a extreme theater geek, but they find a home in a rundown boatyard, things like that, where it's like, we can make it so that way our students are sustaining themselves as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1792.595s">We</a> should be sustaining them, we should be building that safety net, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1796.55s">the</a> more we can help them do that now, the more successful they'll be later on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1800.133s">And</a> that's why also the campaign's really investing its time into the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, the CCSR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1806.9s">I</a> was one of the members of that in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1810.523s">My</a> project became one of the city's free little libraries and investing in that program and bringing that more attention. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1818.991s">It</a> receives funding from the Cummings Foundation, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1822.81s">trying</a> to pivot it so that the city invests in it more and really looks at what we're doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1826.772s">If</a> we can start this, these leadership skills where it's a little more hands-on in the elementary school and maybe middle school level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1833.495s">But</a> once you get to high school, it's hands off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1836.116s">It's</a> very much like you're figuring this out, you know, throw them in the deep end. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1839.758s">We'll</a> see what's what happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1841.038s">And</a> it's working, it's building culture and collaboration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1846.36s">And</a> it's all these keywords again, that we're throwing out there, but looking hypothetically at that kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1853.042s">Um,</a> I don't know, I think just even starting conversations and starting to build and laying foundational groundwork. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1860.086s">So</a> that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1861.387s">Times</a> change, um, you know, we've remodeled houses all the times, but if we have strong, we can't do it unless we have a strong foundation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1869.571s">Um,</a> and so that is something that I would love to do and hope to bring and also just bring students to the table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1874.754s">The</a> only way students have a seat at the table is that one high school senior or the two high school seniors that sit off to the end that don't have a voting, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1880.838s">But,</a> you know, they go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1882.356s">Hey,</a> what's going on there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1883.417s">And</a> then they kind of voice that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1887.58s">And</a> then to sort of end that thought and put the last part of the question, we've rescheduled the kickoff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1893.784s">The</a> kickoff will be October 8th at 11 a.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1897.947s">at</a> the American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1901.27s">It</a> won't be too long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1904.352s">It'll</a> be a great time to sort of raise funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1906.694s">We're</a> later on in the month, but that's okay, because we still have funds left over. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1909.976s">We</a> still have a lot of signs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1911.636s">Um,</a> but really, we also want to give back to the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1914.037s">So</a> a lot of the funds that we will raise will also be donated to, um, if, if groups like the, the orchestra and band reach out, we want to be able to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1921.542s">You</a> know, help fund those projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1923.923s">So</a> it's also, you know, getting, getting in a part of it is getting literacy out and getting signs out, but it also is investing in our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1930.467s">So,</a> um, any, any and all donations are great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1933.949s">Um,</a> we don't have an act blue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1935.55s">We,</a> um, use PayPal and we also have people just sending checks to the house essentially. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ifB2ZVB072WGzbPbtA49o?t=1940.905s">But</a> you can find out more about that on my website.
