    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=61.896s">[Jessica]</a>: All right, everybody, let's get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=64.377s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you again for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=65.878s">[Jessica]</a>: My name is Jessica.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=67.559s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm a third-generation Medford resident, and I come from a long line of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=71.221s">[Jessica]</a>: And I'm one of the many wonderful volunteers on the Invest in Medford campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=75.543s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm really excited to be here with you all tonight in this beautiful, gorgeous Medford Public Library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=80.646s">[Jessica]</a>: And the point of this event is to be a guided conversation with our elected officials who are spearheading these and other question initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=89.83s">[Jessica]</a>: So thank you for spending one day with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=92.051s">[Jessica]</a>: And before we get into everything, I just want to let you all know how the format of this is going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=99.175s">[Jessica]</a>: It's a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=100.795s">[Jessica]</a>: It's a little bit interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=102.456s">[Jessica]</a>: But the whole point of this is to be engaging with that community center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=107.459s">[Jessica]</a>: If you have some questions, we're not posting those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=110.06s">[Jessica]</a>: We'll be saving those for the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=112.081s">[Jessica]</a>: But in terms of how this is going to function,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=115.291s">[Jessica]</a>: All of the questions will be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=116.572s">[Jessica]</a>: They have two minutes to respond just to keep things moving because we do have a hard stop at 8.30 out of respect for our library staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=123.656s">[Jessica]</a>: So time questions will be limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=126.077s">[Jessica]</a>: All questions that we are taking today are over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=129.099s">[Jessica]</a>: So that will happen at the end of our informational section of the panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=134.762s">[Jessica]</a>: And just to make sure that we stay on time and don't keep everybody here too late, we're not going to be doing a long line for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=142.066s">[Jessica]</a>: We're just going to be taking them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=144.028s">[Jessica]</a>: In addition, this will be recorded and will be posted online, so if there's someone out there that wasn't able to attend this evening, that is looking for more information, that will be made available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=159.429s">[Jessica]</a>: In the back of the room, we have some resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=161.85s">[Jessica]</a>: So please feel free to take them, give them a read, take them home with you, give them to a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=166.052s">[Jessica]</a>: All of that is available to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=167.873s">[Jessica]</a>: And myself, as well as many people in here, are volunteers for the campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=171.615s">[Jessica]</a>: If you have any questions, I'm really excited because the volunteer energy that we have for parents and teachers and homeowners and renters really coming together and making this campaign what it is, I'm very excited to be here with you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=185.261s">[Jessica]</a>: So, without further ado,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=189.957s">[Jessica]</a>: to introduce our panelists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=191.298s">[Jessica]</a>: So we have Mary Graham on the left side this evening, City Councilor Anna Callahan and City Vice Chair Ben Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=196.621s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm honored to be sitting here next to the three of you, so thank you so much for what you do and what you're able to do this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=208.189s">[Jessica]</a>: So to start off this evening, I'd like to pass over to Mary Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1134.776s">[Jessica]</a>: really lovely segue into the part that everyone's been waiting for, the guided conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1141.337s">[Jessica]</a>: So the way that we decided to do this is we're going to go question by question, topic by topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1146.821s">[Jessica]</a>: And when the volunteers and I were putting this together, we were taking into account what the majority of people have been asking us, what types of questions we get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1155.647s">[Jessica]</a>: We do reach out the things that we hear most often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1158.609s">[Jessica]</a>: So all these questions, these active questions for this conversation, are informed by voters like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1164.112s">[Jessica]</a>: So we're going to start off with some really great financial stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1169.775s">[Jessica]</a>: That was my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1170.475s">[Jessica]</a>: I should have asked everyone to silence their phones in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1172.296s">[Jessica]</a>: I was reminded to do that, and then it just slipped my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1174.417s">[Jessica]</a>: So if everyone could silence their phones, that would be awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1179.24s">[Jessica]</a>: So we're going to start with free cash and logistics for the revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1184.082s">[Jessica]</a>: So, what is free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1186.683s">[Jessica]</a>: What are some of the projects meant for you to use free cash for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1190.735s">[Jessica]</a>: and just opening up the discussion about new growth commercial revenue, why is that not a bigger chunk of our budget, what is being done to expand this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1202.129s">[Jessica]</a>: So, I'm happy to pass it off to our panel members if they would like to start picking apart these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1702.487s">[Jessica]</a>: Quickly, before we move on to the next topic, do we want to discuss a little bit more about new growth as it pertains to the new sector?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1847.702s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1849.662s">[Jessica]</a>: In the spirit of moving forward and doing better, that's a wonderful segue, again, to our second portion of the guided conversation, where we start looking at three valid questions and answer some questions as it pertains to each of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1863.605s">[Jessica]</a>: So question six is the de-exclusion or deconstruction of the required headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1868.686s">[Jessica]</a>: So, what is a de-exclusion, and if there is a clear need for a required headquarters,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1875.607s">[Jessica]</a>: There is, because there's a valid question on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1878.048s">[Jessica]</a>: What type of things went into that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1879.988s">[Jessica]</a>: What will happen if question six does not pass in terms of the infrastructure that currently exists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2035.044s">[Jessica]</a>: Yes, like what, there's a clear need for public safety measures, so I guess a little bit more about why now and what the difference would be if this renovation of the tarp was not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2218.314s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2219.355s">[Jessica]</a>: So there may be some additional questions about question six on the board, so if there are any, we'll do our best to get to them towards the end, but for the sake of time, I'd like to keep us moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2228.28s">[Jessica]</a>: So that was a little something on question six, and now we're going to move to question seven and eight, which may or may not occur in details a bit more in her introductory remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2238.486s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm not going to read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2239.567s">[Jessica]</a>: These are pulled from the Investment Network website, a little explainer of each of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2244.83s">[Jessica]</a>: The official language of the ballot questions can also be found on our website as well as the city's website for your reference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2250.74s">[Jessica]</a>: But that is what we will be diving into now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2255.259s">[Jessica]</a>: So questions that are named, a little bit of packaging, we'll assemble them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2259.22s">[Jessica]</a>: So we are going to be covering what is the difference in expense between road construction with an in-house crew, like this question will be advocating for, versus a contracted crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2269.842s">[Jessica]</a>: We've received a lot of questions about the specifics regarding how we are going to be spending this money, so we're gonna go into a little bit more detail about the proposed plans for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2280.064s">[Jessica]</a>: And responding to the claims,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2282.714s">[Jessica]</a>: of the money going into a general fund being a restraining focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2286.379s">[Jessica]</a>: So let's last two times together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2288.322s">[Jessica]</a>: Each of you have two minutes to kind of tackle this in whichever order you feel is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2713.155s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you all for your thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2713.956s">[Jessica]</a>: Let's give them a round of applause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2720.084s">[Jessica]</a>: At this time, I invite any of our elected officials in support of this initiative to join the remainder of the panel at the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2728.128s">[Jessica]</a>: If you have any last-minute questions that you'd like to get in, this is your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2733.371s">[Jessica]</a>: But while everyone's reshuffling, I'm going to go take a look and see what our FAQs of the evening are, and then we'll move through those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2820.049s">[Jessica]</a>: Thanks for entertaining a quick intermission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2822.91s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you to our school committee and city council elected officials that have joined us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2828.111s">[Jessica]</a>: We have Councilor Matt Leming, Councilor Emily Lozaro, school committee member Paul Rousseau, city council president Zach Harris, city council vice president Kate Collins, and school committee member Erin Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2839.294s">[Jessica]</a>: Oh wait, there's Erin, she's hiding from me, I'm so sorry, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2844.035s">[Jessica]</a>: Last but certainly not least, school committee member Erin Oropon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2849.019s">[Jessica]</a>: So, our lovely volunteers have taken your questions and they are giving them to me in order of most frequently asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2857.705s">[Jessica]</a>: So, our first theme of the evening is addressing trust and transparency in government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2863.85s">[Jessica]</a>: You just heard from three elected officials that are asking the voters to put their trust in them, and they've picked a very clear case for you, and so I'd like to give everybody the opportunity to talk through that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2878.626s">[Jessica]</a>: Could you, any of you, and we're gonna try to limit to two people responding for questions to keep it moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2886.314s">[Jessica]</a>: It's a Monday night, we wanna get everyone home on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2890.979s">[Jessica]</a>: So, yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2894.422s">[Jessica]</a>: So, any of our members sitting up here, could you explain the formation of the financial task force and how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2902.918s">[Jessica]</a>: the issues of transparency and trust kind of come up around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2906.359s">[Jessica]</a>: So just the behind-the-scenes process, if you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2909.079s">[Jessica]</a>: And I am getting a question just about the raises at the beginning of the session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2913.56s">[Jessica]</a>: So if you would like to just provide an answer for that, that's what the people would like to hear first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2920.902s">[Jessica]</a>: All right, so I'm going to Jenny first, and then Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3176.082s">[Jessica]</a>: Okay, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3177.983s">[Jessica]</a>: In looking at the additional questions in this transparency category, we received a question about some grants that the city has been awarded for road work and as well as lead pipe repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3191.191s">[Jessica]</a>: Do any of you want to talk a little bit about that and perhaps dive into that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3196.615s">[Jessica]</a>: Do you want to take it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3212.457s">[Jessica]</a>: Okay, so that grant money is not guaranteed or accessible at the moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3244.597s">[Jessica]</a>: Does anyone else have any thoughts before I go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3247.839s">[Jessica]</a>: Sorry, we're only taking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3249.64s">[Jessica]</a>: One thing I can say, there will be time at the very end, everyone will mingle, so just please allow Councilors to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3309.146s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3310.886s">[Jessica]</a>: In the interest of moving along,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3313.308s">[Jessica]</a>: We will now move on to our next set of questions, which are surrounded or centered on what happens if these questions do not pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3321.732s">[Jessica]</a>: We've of course gotten into that kind of by talking about the potential for the programs that will be put into place if they do pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3329.315s">[Jessica]</a>: So, if 7-8 don't pass, what has been cut that can be restored, and when will our taxes reflect that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3338.379s">[Jessica]</a>: The question is, if it passes or if it fails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3344.775s">[Jessica]</a>: The question reads, what happens if 7 and 8 don't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3348.638s">[Jessica]</a>: Alternatively, if they do pass, what has been cut that can be restored and when will our taxes reflect that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3446.816s">[Jessica]</a>: Does anybody else have any thoughts they'd like to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3451.922s">[Jessica]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3564.969s">[Jessica]</a>: Does anybody else have some, oh I see a hand raised high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3567.675s">[Jessica]</a>: School Committee Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3568.798s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm going to pass it on back to the other end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3782.731s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3783.411s">[Jessica]</a>: And just super quickly for the last question of this subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3789.92s">[Jessica]</a>: If a yes vote prevails, when will we see the increase on the tax bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3809.053s">[Jessica]</a>: And that is a good way to segue into our next most frequently asked question this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3814.937s">[Jessica]</a>: If question six passes, is the design of the fire station set as is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3820.331s">[Jessica]</a>: And what is the position of the fire chief plus department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3824.596s">[Jessica]</a>: I'm going to assume that means what is their role in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3829.301s">[Jessica]</a>: So if someone would like to discuss about what that would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3962.677s">[Jessica]</a>: I want to apologize because I misinterpreted the question, but then you ended up answering the actual question, so it worked out just fine in terms of how the department heads felt about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3974.961s">[Jessica]</a>: My apologies if that was your question and I misconstrued it, but the answer's there anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3980.382s">[Jessica]</a>: Does anybody have anything they want to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3982.923s">[Jessica]</a>: Otherwise, I would like to move on to some of the other questions and different subject matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4119.162s">[Jessica]</a>: just for the sake of time, I am going to come down a little bit harder on the one or two persons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4124.287s">[Jessica]</a>: No, it's totally okay because I think all of the information is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4127.129s">[Jessica]</a>: I wish we had all the time in the world, but seeing as it is 8-15, I just want to move things along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4132.594s">[Jessica]</a>: So our next set of questions... So I actually haven't seen this question asked before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4143.243s">[Jessica]</a>: We're going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4144.417s">[Jessica]</a>: doing questions through paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4145.717s">[Jessica]</a>: If you want to submit one, feel free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4147.738s">[Jessica]</a>: We're going to try to get through as most of them as possible, which is for the sake of the flow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4151.94s">[Jessica]</a>: We would love it if you could submit your question over there, and everyone will be available after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4161.579s">[Jessica]</a>: Not after this, that was kind of the idea of the city council chamber event last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4167.02s">[Jessica]</a>: But I will be providing everyone with the campaign's contact information if they have additional questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4175.482s">[Jessica]</a>: Okay, we have a hard stop at 830, so we'll do our best to get through everything we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4182.824s">[Jessica]</a>: We appreciate the understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4185.744s">[Jessica]</a>: This next question I personally haven't seen before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4190.197s">[Jessica]</a>: So how can we address seniors and those on fixed income, and is there a possibility for rental assistance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4197.64s">[Jessica]</a>: So if any of my housing policy peeps have an answer to this, I'd love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4207.163s">[Jessica]</a>: You wanna go to Zach first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4311.35s">[Jessica]</a>: Any more thoughts on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4314.252s">[Jessica]</a>: A very similar question, if any of you were able to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4318.302s">[Jessica]</a>: There is a question asking if free cash can be used for rental assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4322.871s">[Jessica]</a>: Does anyone want to talk about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4358.553s">[Jessica]</a>: Okay, moving on from that, I'm also seeing a handful of questions about private roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4365.357s">[Jessica]</a>: This was something new I learned recently myself, the idea of private road repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4369.48s">[Jessica]</a>: So the question is, how will private roads and tree removal be handled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4375.523s">[Jessica]</a>: So if anyone wants to talk about that, that'd be awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4382.227s">[Jessica]</a>: We're gonna do, I saw Kit's hand, so we'll go Kit and then Matt will come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4593.333s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4595.054s">[Jessica]</a>: This question is super quick, so I'm just going to answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4597.055s">[Jessica]</a>: No, there isn't a polling currently being taken for how this vote will go, but we're feeling pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4602.958s">[Jessica]</a>: So I had actually a couple people ask about polling for this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4606.28s">[Jessica]</a>: It's very expensive, so no, there isn't one being done based on our side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4612.082s">[Jessica]</a>: There is another couple of questions that ask how many new students are enrolled in 2025 and how many teachers are retiring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4621.186s">[Jessica]</a>: Do you have appropriations of new students that are enrolling in 2025 and the amount of teachers retiring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4779.383s">[Jessica]</a>: Just for everybody, just to kind of reiterate the importance of this moment and why we're asking voters to make an investment, how do we get here and why have we not done an override before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4793.231s">[Jessica]</a>: Loaded question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4794.012s">[Jessica]</a>: Very, very easy answer for whoever is choosing to tackle this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4897.516s">[Jessica]</a>: Let's see, let's go Anna, and then I believe Kit, then Erica.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5106.088s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you all for your thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5107.748s">[Jessica]</a>: There are a handful of questions that were given to me on Post-it Notes that they have been addressed in their reporting, so I'm going to assume that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5114.969s">[Jessica]</a>: We can all go back and find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5117.131s">[Jessica]</a>: If for some reason you feel like your question hasn't been answered, once again, please reach out to the Steven and Besson Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5121.335s">[Jessica]</a>: We're happy to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5123.457s">[Jessica]</a>: And just to wrap us up here, I wanted to say thank you to all of you for attending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5141.195s">[Jessica]</a>: So thank you for making that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5143.616s">[Jessica]</a>: If you feel compelled by what you heard tonight, I would love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5146.779s">[Jessica]</a>: You can get involved with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5148.2s">[Jessica]</a>: We're in the home stretch of the election, and we need all the help we can get for people who feel really strongly about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5153.303s">[Jessica]</a>: Make your voting plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5154.464s">[Jessica]</a>: Early voting has started at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5156.025s">[Jessica]</a>: You can find all the dates and times and political issues on the city's website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5160.027s">[Jessica]</a>: Text three friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5161.008s">[Jessica]</a>: Make sure they have a voting plan, because civic engagement is more fun together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5164.39s">[Jessica]</a>: We do it as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5165.731s">[Jessica]</a>: Yay, democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5167.202s">[Jessica]</a>: And once again, still have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5168.903s">[Jessica]</a>: If we didn't get to yours, if we didn't get exactly the wording right of what you wanted, please, please email us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5175.349s">[Jessica]</a>: We wanna talk to you, we wanna hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5178.311s">[Jessica]</a>: There's also another question that what you would say to a voter that's on the fence or undecided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5182.754s">[Jessica]</a>: You can reach out to any of us at any point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5185.997s">[Jessica]</a>: We spend a lot of time on the campaign trail and we're happy to share with you just some compelling things that we've discovered through our own conversations if you have friends that are on the fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5196.158s">[Jessica]</a>: And in the spirit of an interesting format and something a little different for everybody, City Councilor Anne Callaghan has a little, has a little, I guess, not an interlude, an exit thing, just to play us out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5214.17s">[Jessica]</a>: But I wanted to say once again, thank you for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5218.112s">[Jessica]</a>: We're really grateful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5219.393s">[Jessica]</a>: And without further ado, our multi-talented City Councilor Anne Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5225.166s">[Jessica]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>
