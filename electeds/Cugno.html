    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3872.033s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3873.283s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3877.525s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3886.608s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3894.731s">[Cugno]</a>: But let's call this what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3896.812s">[Cugno]</a>: I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3901.475s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is, this is not a gender issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3905.858s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a power issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3908.039s">[Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3921.721s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3943.075s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3948.584s">[Cugno]</a>: $25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3953.226s">[Cugno]</a>: than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3959.35s">[Cugno]</a>: And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3975.596s">[Cugno]</a>: the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3986.109s">[Cugno]</a>: They're also the same people that said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3990.325s">[Cugno]</a>: They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3997.832s">[Cugno]</a>: We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4004.859s">[Cugno]</a>: This is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4007.071s">[Cugno]</a>: Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4038.092s">[Cugno]</a>: opportunity to speak what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4061.694s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4071.402s">[Cugno]</a>: I would definitely want to be there but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4074.344s">[Cugno]</a>: I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4077.746s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4084.27s">[Cugno]</a>: And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4088.913s">[Cugno]</a>: Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4095.037s">[Cugno]</a>: If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1974.3s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh yeah, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.392s">[Cugno]</a>: I should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.792s">[Cugno]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5569.433s">[Cugno]</a>: So, my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5574.655s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5575.316s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5588.348s">[Cugno]</a>: What I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5603.383s">[Cugno]</a>: So tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5611.289s">[Cugno]</a>: your agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5624.542s">[Cugno]</a>: You're here for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5627.708s">[Cugno]</a>: When I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5634.85s">[Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5647.393s">[Cugno]</a>: I think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5659.06s">[Cugno]</a>: Let's try the healing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5661.822s">[Cugno]</a>: I totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5664.584s">[Cugno]</a>: I think that what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5666.605s">[Cugno]</a>: Sutton represents is tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5669.727s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5677.15s">[Cugno]</a>: but we need someone to also represent the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5681.491s">[Cugno]</a>: There's a connection with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5683.372s">[Cugno]</a>: Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5684.292s">[Cugno]</a>: She walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5686.552s">[Cugno]</a>: The children know that she walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5689.673s">[Cugno]</a>: She was the smiling face that they saw every morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5693.734s">[Cugno]</a>: There are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5702.196s">[Cugno]</a>: So I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5711.18s">[Cugno]</a>: The people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5716.042s">[Cugno]</a>: We're really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5723.305s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
