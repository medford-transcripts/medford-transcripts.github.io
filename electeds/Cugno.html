    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3872.033s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3873.283s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say, well, first of all, my name is Anne Marie Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3877.525s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm a former Methodist School Committee member, and I'm also a former president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3886.608s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just say, I'm not going to try to repeat what Councilor Scapelli and what Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3894.731s">[Cugno]</a>: But let's call this what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3896.812s">[Cugno]</a>: I am going to be respectful, but I'm also going to be very honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3901.475s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is, this is not a gender issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3905.858s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a power issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3908.039s">[Cugno]</a>: And the reason I say that is because with what morality, after knowing that our teachers have not had a contract in such a long period of time, with what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3921.721s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, with what audacity are we sitting here listening to city councilors and school committee members that are constantly trying to push a two and a half increase and surpass that and constantly saying that we don't have enough money in our budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3943.075s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I did hear councilors say that you have found $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3948.584s">[Cugno]</a>: $25 million could be used and utilized in so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3953.226s">[Cugno]</a>: than just the school committee increase or a school committee increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3959.35s">[Cugno]</a>: And again, I want to reiterate, I was on there for 12 years and the people that are now taking these positions, or I shouldn't say that, the people that have these positions were the same people that stood behind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3975.596s">[Cugno]</a>: the chair rail stating that our positions were supposed to be a volunteer position with no stipend and no salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3986.109s">[Cugno]</a>: They're also the same people that said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3990.325s">[Cugno]</a>: They are also the same people that said that we needed to be available 24-7 whether or not we had jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3997.832s">[Cugno]</a>: We had to be courteous in letting them speak in public when they came to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4004.859s">[Cugno]</a>: This is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4007.071s">[Cugno]</a>: Board committee that now has changed their rules that they only work up until nine o'clock at night They table whatever they want to table because they have jobs of their own and some have made them their own jobs I don't know who is videotaping, but I can't tell you That it's a coincidence that every single person who is against this has been muted And the clapping has been muted also and everybody else has their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4038.092s">[Cugno]</a>: opportunity to speak what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4061.694s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, I'm not I'm not accusing anybody I'm just letting you aware so that way other people know the same thing I Apologize that I cannot be there in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4071.402s">[Cugno]</a>: I would definitely want to be there but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4074.344s">[Cugno]</a>: I have not been able to leave my home in a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4077.746s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's look at what is important before we give a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4084.27s">[Cugno]</a>: And if the school committee wants to give a raise, go ahead, give them a 1%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4088.913s">[Cugno]</a>: Give them something that everyone else has been waiting for and has been fighting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4095.037s">[Cugno]</a>: If we want to be fair to the people that we're representing, let's be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1974.3s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh yeah, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.392s">[Cugno]</a>: I should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5567.792s">[Cugno]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5569.433s">[Cugno]</a>: So, my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5574.655s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5575.316s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5588.348s">[Cugno]</a>: What I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5603.383s">[Cugno]</a>: So tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5611.289s">[Cugno]</a>: your agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5624.542s">[Cugno]</a>: You're here for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5627.708s">[Cugno]</a>: When I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5634.85s">[Cugno]</a>: It wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5647.393s">[Cugno]</a>: I think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5659.06s">[Cugno]</a>: Let's try the healing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5661.822s">[Cugno]</a>: I totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5664.584s">[Cugno]</a>: I think that what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5666.605s">[Cugno]</a>: Sutton represents is tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5669.727s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5677.15s">[Cugno]</a>: but we need someone to also represent the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5681.491s">[Cugno]</a>: There's a connection with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5683.372s">[Cugno]</a>: Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5684.292s">[Cugno]</a>: She walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5686.552s">[Cugno]</a>: The children know that she walked those halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5689.673s">[Cugno]</a>: She was the smiling face that they saw every morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5693.734s">[Cugno]</a>: There are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5702.196s">[Cugno]</a>: So I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5711.18s">[Cugno]</a>: The people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5716.042s">[Cugno]</a>: We're really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5723.305s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8345.745s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, yep, I'm all set, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8349.808s">[Cugno]</a>: I actually have a couple of questions here, and that is, there's been discussion on two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8356.034s">[Cugno]</a>: One is family engagement, and that is how to get your address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8362.497s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh, I'm so sorry, Emery Cugno 871 Felsway Medford mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.4s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8366.981s">[Cugno]</a>: Um, you're welcome and I should have known better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8369.023s">[Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8370.444s">[Cugno]</a>: Um, there were two things that people are talking about and that is one is family engagement and the other one is child engagement, family engagement is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8379.992s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not saying one is more important than the other, but I totally understand the engagement that a person has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8385.414s">[Cugno]</a>: You're only dealing with one teacher most of the time when you're K through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8390.876s">[Cugno]</a>: Once they go to middle school, then there's teams of teachers and high school is the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8395.397s">[Cugno]</a>: It's a very important issue that I know that there was communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8400.419s">[Cugno]</a>: I know we had certain apps that we were working with, software programs that we were working with in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8405.861s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not sure if they're still up and going, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8410.404s">[Cugno]</a>: There's, as a person listening to this meeting, as a parent, I would get, it seems a little bit nerve wracking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8419.732s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I do know that if anyone has ever, I mean, I was on the school committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8425.237s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't remember anybody telling me they couldn't get in touch with their child for an emergency or because their buses had to get switched that day or because someone else was picking them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8436.206s">[Cugno]</a>: They always called<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8437.947s">[Cugno]</a>: the school and the school, whether it be the principal, headmaster, assistant principals, the information always got to the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8448.074s">[Cugno]</a>: So I don't want parents out there thinking that if they don't have iPhones, if they don't have certain, you know, things to connect directly with the child, that they're never going to be able to get a message to their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8463.023s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that before we open up any more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8468.746s">[Cugno]</a>: Mr. Russo said something about pornography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8472.227s">[Cugno]</a>: And as a school committee member, I think that would be a huge issue that should be discussed and taken care of before emails and more emails are put on our sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8486.11s">[Cugno]</a>: So, I mean, if people are saying that their children are seeing pornography that's coming to us, or, I mean, please specify and clarify what's going on, because I think it's important that before anybody else adds more onto our service,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8500.498s">[Cugno]</a>: um, that that really needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9748.419s">[Cugno]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9755.525s">[Cugno]</a>: How did I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9789.965s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9790.265s">[Cugno]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9792.08s">[Cugno]</a>: Do I have to re-say my name and address again, for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9796.464s">[Cugno]</a>: 871-FELSA, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9797.545s">[Cugno]</a>: Guzman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9798.806s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9799.787s">[Cugno]</a>: I would just ask that there are protocols and there's policies, but there's also common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9808.214s">[Cugno]</a>: You're offering to do a meeting both in person and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9812.858s">[Cugno]</a>: So it's not like you're taking away the possibility of people still watching on Zoom, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9819.437s">[Cugno]</a>: The people in the city, they've been asking and they're all, we all want an in-person meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9827.505s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not only speaking for myself, I'm speaking for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9832.53s">[Cugno]</a>: We need to have that opportunity to come in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9837.214s">[Cugno]</a>: Some people feel comfortable on Zoom, some people feel comfortable in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9842.379s">[Cugno]</a>: It's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9843.417s">[Cugno]</a>: it's time for people to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9846.838s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know there's a motion on there saying that maybe you'll wait for your policies and protocols to be looked at and reviewed, but that might even take until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9859.421s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9861.201s">[Cugno]</a>: Gray mentioned something about September, so I just wanna make sure that we clarify that you guys aren't waiting until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6242.202s">[Cugno]</a>: Emery cuneo at 71 Felsway Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6245.643s">[Cugno]</a>: Um, I wasn't able to come down tonight and I had no intention actually of speaking, however, watching this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6254.911s">[Cugno]</a>: I have to say how disheartening I am, not with not with the with the city council but in general, what's going on in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6264.438s">[Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6266.379s">[Cugno]</a>: When I started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6267.74s">[Cugno]</a>: The first thing I really challenged myself and making sure that we'd work on is bullying and the bullying one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6276.867s">[Cugno]</a>: the internet, and we had many forums with many people, whether it be students or adults, police chief, police, we had experts from Bridgewater, and really felt better about those, those, not those rallies, those conferences with everybody and those meetings with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6300.678s">[Cugno]</a>: But I have to say, I feel like we've gone backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6303.639s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not the children that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6305.94s">[Cugno]</a>: It is the adults that we have to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6309.242s">[Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, we're the models for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6314.164s">[Cugno]</a>: So what we do, what we say, how we say it, how we act, how we attack people on Facebook or any type of social media, it's something that our kids see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6328.827s">[Cugno]</a>: Now, I don't plan on speaking on a lot of the things that everybody else has touched upon, but I will speak on a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6336.251s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is one, Gene Barry, Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6341.494s">[Cugno]</a>: Whether or not you know this person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6345.493s">[Cugno]</a>: which I did and I respected and I still respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6349.294s">[Cugno]</a>: And now knowing her rest of the family still have the respect for, but that doesn't make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6356.395s">[Cugno]</a>: The difference is, is that you have a person who has family in the city, who has given a lot to this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6364.217s">[Cugno]</a>: No one has the right to speak and throw things out about someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6370.963s">[Cugno]</a>: What kills me is the fact that people that are writing are the ones that are saying we shouldn't act like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6379.051s">[Cugno]</a>: Now, with that being said, as an Italian, so far now, I've been called a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6388.66s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been called other names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6391.383s">[Cugno]</a>: Growing up in this city changed a lot of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6396.371s">[Cugno]</a>: because we became evolved and like we expected to respect everyone, we don't pick and choose which nationality we are going to respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6409.679s">[Cugno]</a>: We respect all nationalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6412.981s">[Cugno]</a>: From an Italian who was bullied when she was in school, where my name was changed because I was an Italian, and over the years finally get respect that we are all being treated equally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6426.368s">[Cugno]</a>: That was wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6429.111s">[Cugno]</a>: And now to hear that if I'm Italian, I need to be quiet or I am now accused as a cheater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6435.476s">[Cugno]</a>: I would love to know that if I wrote something like that about someone else from a different type of culture or a different nationality or a different group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6447.41s">[Cugno]</a>: If it would've been just thrown under the rug, shoved under the rug, and hey, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6454.472s">[Cugno]</a>: If we are going to advocate for diversity, and if we are going to advocate for fairness in this city, it has to start with all nationalities, all cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6471.737s">[Cugno]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6473.676s">[Cugno]</a>: Heard something a few weeks ago, and I know but I think that I'm crazy but The thing that I heard was actually on It was on the Oscars and it was from Mr. Perry who received a humanitarian award and what I loved about what he said, and I truly believe this is that he said<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6499.074s">[Cugno]</a>: We, in our hearts, do not have room for hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6505.757s">[Cugno]</a>: We do not have room for hate for Asians, or blacks, or whites, or police officers, or anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6515.983s">[Cugno]</a>: We need to come to a middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6518.784s">[Cugno]</a>: Well, I believe there's someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6520.505s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't know why I have someone else on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6525.954s">[Cugno]</a>: What we need to do is we need to get the city down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6529.218s">[Cugno]</a>: Not in the things of what we believe or who believes, but back in the middle to understand what the city's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6539.33s">[Cugno]</a>: And I'm sorry, but I can't see the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6541.152s">[Cugno]</a>: I actually see someone else on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6545.848s">[Cugno]</a>: But what I'm trying to say is we need to come to the middle, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6551.191s">[Cugno]</a>: We're not saying because you're here so many years that you have a right to speak above someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6557.696s">[Cugno]</a>: What we're saying is let's talk together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6561.878s">[Cugno]</a>: And it seems to me that the groups that are coming in contradict each other because they're treating each other like the ones that they're accusing other groups of being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6572.721s">[Cugno]</a>: It's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6574.021s">[Cugno]</a>: And now the latest I heard is for certain people that want to make sure that we, as when we present ourselves at a podium, are not supposed to say that we're lifelong citizens or residents of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6587.745s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6589.906s">[Cugno]</a>: But I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6591.507s">[Cugno]</a>: I have grown up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6592.607s">[Cugno]</a>: I have chose to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6595.089s">[Cugno]</a>: I have chosen to keep my children and raise my children here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6599.271s">[Cugno]</a>: It is not a disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6600.391s">[Cugno]</a>: It is not a leprosy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6602.592s">[Cugno]</a>: It is a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6603.573s">[Cugno]</a>: And I want to be proud of I am an Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6607.455s">[Cugno]</a>: And yes, I am proud to say that I come from Fredford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6611.077s">[Cugno]</a>: But I am not proud of where method is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">[Cugno]</a>: Could you hear me now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">[Cugno]</a>: Man, you can hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I do understand where everyone is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">[Cugno]</a>: I know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">[Cugno]</a>: One was from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">[Cugno]</a>: Mostone and the other one is from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">[Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">[Cugno]</a>: But again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">[Cugno]</a>: And my standpoint is that with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">[Cugno]</a>: the commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">[Cugno]</a>: You need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes, they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">[Cugno]</a>: two, three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">[Cugno]</a>: I do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">[Cugno]</a>: I know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">[Cugno]</a>: I believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">[Cugno]</a>: So again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">[Cugno]</a>: precedence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">[Cugno]</a>: We need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">[Cugno]</a>: Could someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">[Cugno]</a>: From the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's coming, that should have already been started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">[Cugno]</a>: And the discussion is already should have already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not aware if it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">[Cugno]</a>: But I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">[Cugno]</a>: And at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">[Cugno]</a>: A lot of people go on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">[Cugno]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">[Cugno]</a>: So it's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3822.543s">[Cugno]</a>: hold on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3847.561s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3867.934s">[Cugno]</a>: And from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3876.7s">[Cugno]</a>: And it wasn't open to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3879.183s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3880.825s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3886.67s">[Cugno]</a>: So if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3891.255s">[Cugno]</a>: And how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3903.259s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3921.761s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3933.7s">[Cugno]</a>: The fact remains is who's going to be interviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3938.31s">[Cugno]</a>: the people that apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3940.052s">[Cugno]</a>: Who is selecting the applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3943.255s">[Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen the application before it goes out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3946.657s">[Cugno]</a>: Has the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3952.843s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3953.703s">[Cugno]</a>: And I have had a lot of questions of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3957.126s">[Cugno]</a>: not to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3966.634s">[Cugno]</a>: Because I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3972.058s">[Cugno]</a>: Because that is, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6925.842s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6926.242s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just getting it ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6932.286s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6936.108s">[Cugno]</a>: I asked a few questions before, and that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6940.211s">[Cugno]</a>: The reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6950.895s">[Cugno]</a>: So I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6955.456s">[Cugno]</a>: But as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6961.358s">[Cugno]</a>: Has the diversity director seen it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6965.08s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6970.402s">[Cugno]</a>: Again, we're talking the priority of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6975.483s">[Cugno]</a>: If there are people right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6977.916s">[Cugno]</a>: on the committee that feel that the name should be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6981.119s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6996.393s">[Cugno]</a>: The change is going to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6997.975s">[Cugno]</a>: So I don't understand why that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7000.497s">[Cugno]</a>: Second of all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7002.176s">[Cugno]</a>: Again, I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7008.603s">[Cugno]</a>: You have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7019.054s">[Cugno]</a>: Being involved in the system, I know how much time it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7024.244s">[Cugno]</a>: But again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7029.645s">[Cugno]</a>: How much time is gonna be put into it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7031.806s">[Cugno]</a>: Who are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7036.047s">[Cugno]</a>: How are you going to put everyone on the same schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7042.048s">[Cugno]</a>: More importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7052.907s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7060.23s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry, Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9427.874s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so if I'm understanding this the correct way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9433.08s">[Cugno]</a>: If I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to take a round of questions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9436.563s">[Cugno]</a>: You're going to go and work on the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9439.605s">[Cugno]</a>: And then once it's done and you're all finished, you're going to come back to take more questions from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9448.132s">[Cugno]</a>: So we're after 8 o'clock now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9450.715s">[Cugno]</a>: So we're going to expect you to come back at 10, 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9454.938s">[Cugno]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9456.339s">[Cugno]</a>: Second of all is the fact that, you know, everybody keeps on saying everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9461.244s">[Cugno]</a>: I think everybody forgets the fact that if everybody had been heard in June, you would have had your 600 signatures against the, I don't want to say against, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9474.375s">[Cugno]</a>: versus the 300 signatures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9476.596s">[Cugno]</a>: So I guess my question again, isn't this a mute conversation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9482.199s">[Cugno]</a>: Because everybody keeps on saying that everybody's been hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9486.0s">[Cugno]</a>: And these questions and concerns from the community started when we finally did hear about what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9494.521s">[Cugno]</a>: And again, it's just frustrating because I've asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9498.745s">[Cugno]</a>: There have been other people tonight that have asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9501.467s">[Cugno]</a>: And out of respect, it would be nice if we got some type of answer because you still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9508.133s">[Cugno]</a>: You don't know any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9511.476s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as the comment on process and policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9515.914s">[Cugno]</a>: As a former school committee member, we had many processes and policies, we just didn't throw this up and say in one night, we're going to do this, whether people you know agree or disagree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9527.828s">[Cugno]</a>: I just think that the process, again, you're going to have people against him for this, but this is a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9535.325s">[Cugno]</a>: community has been speaking, and it seems like tonight that people are asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9540.79s">[Cugno]</a>: There still has not been one person who has stood up and answered any of them or addressed any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9547.896s">[Cugno]</a>: But on June 30th, or whatever the day was, those answers to those questions were all answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9556.803s">[Cugno]</a>: As a school committee, you're supposed to be representing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9561.527s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you, Anne-Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9563.189s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16325.005s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16327.106s">[Cugno]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16328.587s">[Cugno]</a>: Basically, again, we're still at the same position we were four hours ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16333.269s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have a committee who keeps on telling me that it's not gonna take any time, it doesn't take time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16338.451s">[Cugno]</a>: We have administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16340.012s">[Cugno]</a>: We have to open up our schools to all our elementary schools have to be open in three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16346.475s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't understand this process this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16349.756s">[Cugno]</a>: And honestly, the members keep on saying that they hear people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16353.298s">[Cugno]</a>: Well, I've been listening to people all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16355.939s">[Cugno]</a>: but no one has addressed the situation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16358.741s">[Cugno]</a>: It's like you've heard, but you're continuing on with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16362.864s">[Cugno]</a>: You're continuing on with everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16364.346s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, you have members that are concerned that there might be actors that might be applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16370.45s">[Cugno]</a>: How are they going to distinguish which ones are actors and which ones are not actors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16375.974s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, I am frustrated to the point that I am so disheartened with my school committee, something I cherished very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16385.882s">[Cugno]</a>: and to keep on listening to this for the next four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16390.086s">[Cugno]</a>: And no one has discussed anything about our school, our kids going back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16394.39s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as member McLaughlin, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16397.173s">[Cugno]</a>: It is not up to the school committee to make the policy of how they're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16401.357s">[Cugno]</a>: But you have to be involved in that planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16404.74s">[Cugno]</a>: You need to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16408.021s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, this is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16410.363s">[Cugno]</a>: No one is saying to change your values change your opinion, change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16415.268s">[Cugno]</a>: We're just asking, or I'm asking, slow down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16419.963s">[Cugno]</a>: pick it and do it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16422.004s">[Cugno]</a>: As far as people saying they've heard us, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16425.427s">[Cugno]</a>: Because if you listen to what's going on tonight, for the last four hours of participation, you've had both people that are for it and people that are against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16433.893s">[Cugno]</a>: But it seems that the people are for it have been listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16437.856s">[Cugno]</a>: And the people that are not for it, for whatever reason, everybody has the right to believe what they wanna believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16444.82s">[Cugno]</a>: Put the kids first tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16448.362s">[Cugno]</a>: and postponing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16450.223s">[Cugno]</a>: I'd like to know if the process is gonna be like this to make sure our kids are gonna have proms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16455.127s">[Cugno]</a>: What's the MCAS gonna be like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16457.068s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be an MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16458.869s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there gonna be any type of social break for the kids this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16463.893s">[Cugno]</a>: Graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23094.181s">[Cugno]</a>: Can I just ask the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23095.422s">[Cugno]</a>: Because I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23096.202s">[Cugno]</a>: Are you still going to be taking names of Italian people or people in history with Italian names?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23104.806s">[Cugno]</a>: Or is that off the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23108.227s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23111.676s">[Cugno]</a>: All right, and then what I do ask is that, you know, for some people it's the name, for some people it's what it represents and doesn't represent, and some people believe certain readings that they have read, some have other opinions, but really keep in mind, you know, it's about culture, it's about history, it's about, yes, it's about Italians that did come into the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23140.981s">[Cugno]</a>: and didn't make, made a lot of sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23143.783s">[Cugno]</a>: And I am an Italian, I understand exactly what the, just, you know, diversity is and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23152.609s">[Cugno]</a>: But if it's not about the Italian name, and that's what I've been hearing tonight, then I really recommend that an Italian name be selected, because it feels as an Italian American, and I truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23166.338s">[Cugno]</a>: believe this is that it's wiping out a lot of what you know the community stood for, and I understand about the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23175.469s">[Cugno]</a>: I know about the diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23176.991s">[Cugno]</a>: I know about progress, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23179.87s">[Cugno]</a>: If it seems like we've been asking all night to postpone or whatever, and even though people have listened, they haven't heard, and people are gonna get upset that I said that, but at least listen to the fact that we do have more than just a name attached to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23198.82s">[Cugno]</a>: There's a lot more that, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, but there's a lot more that maybe people are not aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23206.164s">[Cugno]</a>: that maybe if they ask the people that live in the city and has doesn't have to be, you don't have to be here your whole life, you don't have to be here 10 months, you don't have to be here a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23215.65s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying listen, and really understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=23220.092s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not just about a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10421.085s">[Cugno]</a>: And we all come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14810.72s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, am I all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14813.061s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14815.342s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I've been listening to the meeting tonight, and I know you said give me two minutes, but I'm gonna try my best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14822.465s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been listening to the meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14825.727s">[Cugno]</a>: As some of you might know or not know, I am a former school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14830.949s">[Cugno]</a>: And I try to listen with fair ears and to listen to all sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14837.533s">[Cugno]</a>: It seems like listening to all the subcommittee meetings that you've had, and with the mandate of, let's say, the commissioner, there's a lot on everyone's plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14852.502s">[Cugno]</a>: And there has to be a president's, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't get this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14860.856s">[Cugno]</a>: We're talking about process, we're talking about priorities and looking at what you have on your plate, you have budgets coming, you have the, you know, you have parents that really don't know if they want to select hybrid if they do want to select hybrid if they want to have their students in school, there's a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14880.831s">[Cugno]</a>: With all due respect, you guys have spent a lot of time on this, but I can guarantee you there's going to be a lot more phone calls from a lot of people right now, asking about the differences between, you know, what they choose what they don't choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14895.695s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess, from what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14899.176s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not the fact of, do you want to name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14903.42s">[Cugno]</a>: Don't you want the name change of the Columbus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14905.542s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess what I'm respectfully asking is asking the school committee and you, the mayor, as the chair, to really consider putting the priority of putting our children back into school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14916.732s">[Cugno]</a>: I know you've been working diligently on trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14920.255s">[Cugno]</a>: But when you have the commissioner of the state of Massachusetts, who is going to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14925.506s">[Cugno]</a>: putting mandates and putting his own spin on certain things, even though it might not seem fair, it's going to have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14934.773s">[Cugno]</a>: And listening to the results of the decrease of the positive COVID tests, I mean, listening to a lot of the people that have already called and made decisions to the school system,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14950.505s">[Cugno]</a>: to let them know if their children are going hybrid and stuff, you do have a lot of positives going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14957.157s">[Cugno]</a>: So when the commissioner looks at something like that, he's going to know that here's a city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14963.905s">[Cugno]</a>: who is going to be positive, and he's going to be putting more pressure on that because the numbers that decrease in COVID are huge as far as the lesser we have, the better opportunity to get back into the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14978.975s">[Cugno]</a>: They are going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14980.817s">[Cugno]</a>: And so I know there's a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14984.099s">[Cugno]</a>: you know, high passionate people out there for or against this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14990.001s">[Cugno]</a>: But honestly, at this point, I really just ask the school committee to please put your priorities intact as far as this just came up the pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15000.906s">[Cugno]</a>: You need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16077.722s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16078.983s">[Cugno]</a>: So basically, listening to everyone, again, I mean, what everybody's put on the table is extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16085.489s">[Cugno]</a>: I totally agree about the non-rushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16087.831s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that even with that being said, there might be members that don't believe that it's a rushed decision, but I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16098.741s">[Cugno]</a>: member credits for bringing up the no name situation, because I know that that's been out there and people were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16107.147s">[Cugno]</a>: But again, you know it's time is of the essence, and you have so much going on that now you're here this evening, you've already spoken about it, I understand how the rules go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16120.353s">[Cugno]</a>: But now you're going to spend Wednesday night discussing this all over again and going into it in more depth and detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16129.641s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess stepping back and looking at what's going on and what's being asked of from cities and towns all over the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16139.17s">[Cugno]</a>: It just seems that that time that you're spending on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16143.776s">[Cugno]</a>: No one is saying that, at least, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16148.643s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying the priority of the dates and the time that you have and what you need to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16155.231s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16156.771s">[Cugno]</a>: I truly believe that the time should be spent on getting the kids back in school, what the game plan is, how much money is it going to cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16164.353s">[Cugno]</a>: You have custodians that are going to have to be cleaning a lot more than what they're doing now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16168.734s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, what do you have in the budget set aside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16170.694s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, there's a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=16173.235s">[Cugno]</a>: So I respectfully just say, you know, it's really to look at your timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=706.537s">[Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=707.659s">[Cugno]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=708.199s">[Cugno]</a>: Name and address, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=709.461s">[Cugno]</a>: Anne-Marie Cugno, 871 Felsway, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=712.446s">[Cugno]</a>: It is my pleasure again to, hello, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=715.797s">[Cugno]</a>: and Madam Chair, and to Mr. Superintendent, that I present Jagan Lamanta, who is the president of, well, she was the founder of CASET, and they have been very generous over the years to give us the money that have allowed our students to learn the language, the Italian language, over the years, and it really,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=739.732s">[Cugno]</a>: networked with our high school students, especially, and done a lot with our students over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=745.754s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to pass it over to Dr. Mata.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5030.639s">[Cugno]</a>: May I have the address, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5040.844s">[Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Felsway, Mefford, Mass, 02155.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5044.626s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say, as a former school committee member, I didn't have the opportunity last time the McGlynn parents came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5051.329s">[Cugno]</a>: But it is, I'm sorry, McGlynn teachers and administration came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5055.291s">[Cugno]</a>: But as a parent of the McGlynn, I want to say that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5059.34s">[Cugno]</a>: your strides in your everyday, I'm sorry, it's addressing them, but what you do on an everyday basis is really immeasurable, and if you don't believe us as parents, just think when the older kids that are in high school and in college, when they're all coming back into your building and they're looking for you, that's gratification, and that shows that you're all doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5086.572s">[Cugno]</a>: So unfortunately, there's high emotions going on, but we are very proud of both of our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5091.777s">[Cugno]</a>: And as parents, I can say I've had them at both schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5095.28s">[Cugno]</a>: And you need to find your fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5097.381s">[Cugno]</a>: It doesn't matter how many children you have, you need to find your fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5100.504s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5102.085s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5039.732s">[Cugno]</a>: May I have the address, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5040.813s">[Cugno]</a>: Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Felsway, Medford, Mass, 02155.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5044.596s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say, as a former school committee member, I didn't have the opportunity last time the McGlynn parents came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5051.301s">[Cugno]</a>: But it is, I'm sorry, McGlynn teachers and administration came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5055.263s">[Cugno]</a>: But as a parent of the McGlynn, I want to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5059.307s">[Cugno]</a>: your strides in your everyday, I'm sorry, it's addressing them, but what you do on an everyday basis is really immeasurable, and if you don't believe us as parents, just think when the older kids that are in high school and in college, when they're all coming back into your building and they're looking for you, that's gratification, and that shows that you're all doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5086.538s">[Cugno]</a>: So unfortunately there's high emotions going on, but we are very proud of both of our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5091.743s">[Cugno]</a>: And as parents, I can say I've had them at both schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5095.246s">[Cugno]</a>: And you need to find your fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5097.347s">[Cugno]</a>: It doesn't matter how many children you have, you need to find your fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5100.47s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=5102.051s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=373.94s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=374.14s">[Cugno]</a>: Cugno, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=375.822s">[Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=377.503s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=389.532s">[Cugno]</a>: You guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=394.716s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigny, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=404.35s">[Cugno]</a>: And if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=414.093s">[Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=422.316s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.237s">[Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=445.758s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to put that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=446.999s">[Cugno]</a>: It's all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=468.585s">[Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=469.746s">[Cugno]</a>: Put them all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=495.977s">[Cugno]</a>: We're all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=498.557s">[Cugno]</a>: Is everyone's mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.158s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.638s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=500.938s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=501.318s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=503.258s">[Cugno]</a>: So the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=507.499s">[Cugno]</a>: Move to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=509.559s">[Cugno]</a>: I just have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=511.36s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.0s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=512.52s">[Cugno]</a>: If that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.311s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=629.491s">[Cugno]</a>: Kreatz, you all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=633.494s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=634.735s">[Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Scari, motion and the second of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=639.618s">[Cugno]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=646.023s">[Cugno]</a>: It's affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=647.044s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=650.066s">[Cugno]</a>: Approved to put the minutes on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=653.663s">[Cugno]</a>: Approve of bills and transfers of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=655.584s">[Cugno]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=656.465s">[Cugno]</a>: Move to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=657.285s">[Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=663.169s">[Cugno]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=664.349s">[Cugno]</a>: And we need a roll call on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=726.085s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=728.306s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion to accept and approve the bill of transfers of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=735.227s">[Cugno]</a>: Passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=746.411s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=746.612s">[Cugno]</a>: Secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=754.935s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=756.076s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=757.936s">[Cugno]</a>: The motion to approve the payrolls and place on file have passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=762.838s">[Cugno]</a>: Report of the secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=773.168s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, report of the committee, which is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=775.79s">[Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees, committee of the whole meeting, minutes for December 11th, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=885.319s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 715 AM or PM?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.206s">[Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=996.361s">[Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=998.342s">[Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1008.551s">[Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1015.958s">[Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1019.541s">[Cugno]</a>: if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1026.544s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you, as a committee, have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1032.167s">[Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1033.708s">[Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1042.777s">[Cugno]</a>: we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1047.419s">[Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1063.067s">[Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1066.635s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1067.175s">[Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1069.516s">[Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1071.797s">[Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1073.298s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1074.238s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1076.519s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.439s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.68s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1077.86s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1084.422s">[Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1089.184s">[Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1639.876s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1675.755s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Scottie just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1682.324s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1686.19s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1690.233s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school, but with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1704.665s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1713.362s">[Cugno]</a>: to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1715.784s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see, are we gonna roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1723.371s">[Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1727.936s">[Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1729.117s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1730.718s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1733.02s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1749.199s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1750.56s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1753.562s">[Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1760.127s">[Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1885.863s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1886.103s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1887.324s">[Cugno]</a>: If you could just make sure that during the year you let us know how students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1954.286s">[Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1956.488s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.108s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1957.748s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1958.989s">[Cugno]</a>: He's done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1960.05s">[Cugno]</a>: And again, we appreciate all that he's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1963.013s">[Cugno]</a>: All of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1964.454s">[Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1994.193s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1996.215s">[Cugno]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2005.362s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2006.683s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2008.505s">[Cugno]</a>: We will graciously accept the gift from Dr. Schmitt as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2011.807s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.708s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.168s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2013.569s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2014.77s">[Cugno]</a>: Report on Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2505.578s">[Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2514.482s">[Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2516.305s">[Cugno]</a>: first and then just because it's been such a great program and already there's been so much going on at the end of the three years have they already discussed like what the process is going to be if you're going to be able to reapply for it or is it so we are going to be able to reapply or is it like one of those you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time oh okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2547.702s">[Cugno]</a>: You're looking for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2554.645s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2560.217s">[Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2573.966s">[Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2580.091s">[Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2583.394s">[Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2585.135s">[Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2594.804s">[Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2600.589s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2603.191s">[Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2612.9s">[Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2621.068s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2623.71s">[Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2626.191s">[Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2635.334s">[Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2637.314s">[Cugno]</a>: Because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2643.636s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2645.517s">[Cugno]</a>: They're in our center of our square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2647.177s">[Cugno]</a>: They're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2649.138s">[Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2653.92s">[Cugno]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2655.101s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3415.256s">[Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3416.396s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that, and she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3421.398s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3425.422s">[Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3432.37s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3436.254s">[Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3439.798s">[Cugno]</a>: at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times, and around the year they have certain lunches that they do, and I know it's hard, because our kids are in school, but if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves, tell them what you're there for, and maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3458.945s">[Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3460.165s">[Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3461.526s">[Cugno]</a>: But I did hear about that, and it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.1s">[Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3468.7s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3469.34s">[Cugno]</a>: Are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3743.917s">[Cugno]</a>: How many did you steal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3747.645s">[Cugno]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3748.525s">[Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3749.266s">[Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3750.566s">[Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3753.467s">[Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that, and you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3761.229s">[Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart and, you know, and opening up your mind that, for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3769.872s">[Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3770.472s">[Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3774.643s">[Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3784.848s">[Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3785.909s">[Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3810.463s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3811.263s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3812.164s">[Cugno]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.239s">[Cugno]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3993.739s">[Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4045.38s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4046.71s">[Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4186.653s">[Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4195.318s">[Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4196.839s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio stations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4200.404s">[Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4206.586s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, the creative workshops, something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4213.028s">[Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4217.509s">[Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4222.551s">[Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4233.099s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4244.908s">[Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4246.189s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4247.691s">[Cugno]</a>: So if we could play that on our station, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4326.193s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4328.095s">[Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spocker, you had said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4331.901s">[Cugno]</a>: You're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4335.103s">[Cugno]</a>: Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4336.523s">[Cugno]</a>: McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4337.023s">[Cugno]</a>: And McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4338.064s">[Cugno]</a>: So everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4339.644s">[Cugno]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4386.913s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4387.514s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.082s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4447.702s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4449.558s">[Cugno]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4450.058s">[Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4451.459s">[Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4452.299s">[Cugno]</a>: So can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4454.92s">[Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4455.56s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.101s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4459.721s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4460.602s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4461.482s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4463.983s">[Cugno]</a>: 7 in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4465.063s">[Cugno]</a>: The report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4469.665s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4470.285s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4471.065s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4473.506s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4479.692s">[Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4485.535s">[Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4496.42s">[Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4501.944s">[Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4514.893s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4517.515s">[Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4518.895s">[Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4522.276s">[Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4525.717s">[Cugno]</a>: Mr. Christopher Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4677.182s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4681.595s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.377s">[Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4685.677s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be static?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4693.762s">[Cugno]</a>: No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4695.583s">[Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4696.403s">[Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4700.165s">[Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval only, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4701.946s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.027s">[Cugno]</a>: the way that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4704.728s">[Cugno]</a>: But in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4714.575s">[Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4722.33s">[Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4725.595s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4728.839s">[Cugno]</a>: Or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and say, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4757.379s">[Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4760.442s">[Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4761.423s">[Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4763.344s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4764.265s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4765.126s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4767.808s">[Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4770.791s">[Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4774.814s">[Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4940.27s">[Cugno]</a>: Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5145.719s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5162.503s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5174.949s">[Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5175.669s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5176.95s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5178.771s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion passes and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5183.573s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5187.684s">[Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5200.448s">[Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5828.068s">[Cugno]</a>: When does this draft have to be accepted by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5836.35s">[Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5844.494s">[Cugno]</a>: But the amount isn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5850.656s">[Cugno]</a>: So, excuse me, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5852.737s">[Cugno]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.51s">[Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5969.75s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5970.911s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5971.091s">[Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot and then may I go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.064s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6282.684s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess with what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6284.905s">[Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6288.167s">[Cugno]</a>: If the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6295.274s">[Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6300.599s">[Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6302.509s">[Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6309.131s">[Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6319.63s">[Cugno]</a>: approve what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government so we have that piece but don't approve, like make it separate and don't approve the amount until maybe you can come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.4s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6547.78s">[Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.071s">[Cugno]</a>: And seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6565.892s">[Cugno]</a>: Vanderbilt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6567.513s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6583.384s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6595.234s">[Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6596.255s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6597.236s">[Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6599.175s">[Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6600.296s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6619.113s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you all to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6621.595s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6622.616s">[Cugno]</a>: And if I may, I should condemn it to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.622s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6628.942s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6630.364s">[Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6665.412s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6666.733s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6667.053s">[Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6672.345s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, and two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6674.709s">[Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6676.792s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6679.155s">[Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6680.938s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke, seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6684.143s">[Cugno]</a>: Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6738.61s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6887.243s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7130.822s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7510.793s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7597.908s">[Cugno]</a>: say thank you to you, the staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7603.553s">[Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7605.795s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7613.081s">[Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here, and sometimes over the years, I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7622.028s">[Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7624.51s">[Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7626.252s">[Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7629.874s">[Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7632.116s">[Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7637.68s">[Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7642.572s">[Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7648.775s">[Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7654.998s">[Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free for all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7662.262s">[Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7882.66s">[Cugno]</a>: Dr. Peralta, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7895.31s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to ask real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7897.452s">[Cugno]</a>: What are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7900.514s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7920.137s">[Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7977.756s">[Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7985.562s">[Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right, you have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7992.148s">[Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion, so it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8033.769s">[Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8044.912s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8110.603s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's not expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8118.485s">[Cugno]</a>: The gadget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8119.825s">[Cugno]</a>: The gadget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8120.285s">[Cugno]</a>: That we were just passing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8516.759s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8635.842s">[Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece, but an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8650.127s">[Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8653.708s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8655.648s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8658.53s">[Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8665.276s">[Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8667.037s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8669.96s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8675.885s">[Cugno]</a>: but we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8677.666s">[Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8690.15s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't know, I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, okay, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8698.574s">[Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8699.954s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8703.095s">[Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8708.717s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, this is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8712.758s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8862.659s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8863.8s">[Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.181s">[Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8867.581s">[Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8873.282s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.118s">[Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9265.918s">[Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9266.919s">[Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9268.099s">[Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9556.673s">[Cugno]</a>: Have you lived in my house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9558.374s">[Cugno]</a>: It's like yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9881.628s">[Cugno]</a>: some time to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9883.872s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9885.435s">[Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9891.831s">[Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9901.86s">[Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9905.483s">[Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was the new member, and within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9916.946s">[Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9921.248s">[Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9924.249s">[Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9932.853s">[Cugno]</a>: And keep what's important in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9937.094s">[Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9938.575s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9941.427s">[Cugno]</a>: Always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9949.771s">[Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9961.502s">[Cugno]</a>: Don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9964.224s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9965.465s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been on the site councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9967.166s">[Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9969.587s">[Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state, and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9974.69s">[Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9978.913s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent, who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9990.014s">[Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9991.756s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9993.758s">[Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9997.562s">[Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door into the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present, Dr. Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10011.692s">[Cugno]</a>: really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10017.956s">[Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10023.739s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10026.9s">[Cugno]</a>: What is she going to come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10028.581s">[Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10032.683s">[Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10037.105s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10041.017s">[Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10044.098s">[Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight, probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10054.28s">[Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10059.321s">[Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who's always been there for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10066.123s">[Cugno]</a>: to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10068.345s">[Cugno]</a>: But just work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10102.633s">[Cugno]</a>: I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=10105.3s">[Cugno]</a>: This was a relaxing time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=364.892s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=365.092s">[Cugno]</a>: Cugno, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=366.793s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=368.475s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that you're only representing the larger group of all the students that are participating in the orchestra, but not only to the orchestra, but to everyone itself, the marching band, the orchestra, the drama club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=380.504s">[Cugno]</a>: You guys represent us, and you've done a terrific and wonderful job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=385.668s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing I also want to ask Mr. Zigney, and I know I've mentioned it on record here, is that we did get a donation from Mr. John Costas for the lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=394.414s">[Cugno]</a>: And if we could recognize him, well, if you guys could recognize him, come the new year, that would be really nice because we do have a lot of people in the city, as Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=405.085s">[Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot, you know, sometimes when someone else might not need something, it is very valuable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=413.312s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just want to say thank you to all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=435.898s">[Cugno]</a>: All set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=436.598s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to put that on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=437.96s">[Cugno]</a>: It's all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=459.554s">[Cugno]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=460.414s">[Cugno]</a>: I need John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=461.054s">[Cugno]</a>: Is everybody's mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=473.798s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=474.038s">[Cugno]</a>: Put them all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=484.041s">[Cugno]</a>: We're all on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=489.547s">[Cugno]</a>: Is everyone's mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=491.609s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=494.212s">[Cugno]</a>: So, the first thing on our agenda is the approval of the minutes of December 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=498.476s">[Cugno]</a>: Moved to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=501.099s">[Cugno]</a>: I just have a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=625.705s">[Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry, motion and the second of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=651.576s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=652.176s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=653.377s">[Cugno]</a>: And we need a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=739.493s">[Cugno]</a>: Mrs. DeBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=764.121s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=764.261s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=764.381s">[Cugno]</a>: Report of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=765.421s">[Cugno]</a>: Which is next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=766.782s">[Cugno]</a>: Report of the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=767.643s">[Cugno]</a>: Committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=769.283s">[Cugno]</a>: Minutes for December 11, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=876.333s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, just a clarification, if I may, 7.15 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.016s">[Cugno]</a>: or p.m.?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=879.737s">[Cugno]</a>: P.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=882.22s">[Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=987.355s">[Cugno]</a>: If I may on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=988.475s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=989.336s">[Cugno]</a>: When we sat down with Glenn Kuchar from the MASC, the executive director, there are a lot of legal policies that we need to abide by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=999.539s">[Cugno]</a>: And so that was one of the reasons that we can't have more than a certain amount of school committee members on that particular committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1006.942s">[Cugno]</a>: If we do, then we also have to discuss as a school committee if you want to waive the rights of executive session, and that means that everything would have to be open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1017.547s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's something that you as a committee have to sit down and discuss on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1023.19s">[Cugno]</a>: So that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1024.71s">[Cugno]</a>: And the other reason, I also believe that it had come up in discussion if we wanted to alternate people, but it got to the point where it would be very, we're kind of like playing very fine line with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1038.439s">[Cugno]</a>: And a lot of the things, again, when people are asking us questions like this, it's not because Medford wants to deal with it like this, and I'm not saying it to cover ourselves, but it's actually rules and regulations and federal government that we need to abide by laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1054.053s">[Cugno]</a>: So that was the reason we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1058.155s">[Cugno]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1060.497s">[Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Skerry had a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1062.798s">[Cugno]</a>: Who was seconded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1064.299s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1065.239s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1067.521s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.361s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1068.641s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so the committee and the whole meetings are approved and placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1075.405s">[Cugno]</a>: Community participation, Maureen Roney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1080.168s">[Cugno]</a>: Roney, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1278.487s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm going to just ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1279.587s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1280.748s">[Cugno]</a>: So Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1281.628s">[Cugno]</a>: DiBenedetto and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1630.876s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1666.285s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, and if I may, just for clarification, because I know Mr. Skerry just mentioned middle school, but is it elementary school that we're discussing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1673.291s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, I just want to make sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1677.179s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to piggyback a little bit on what Mr. Benedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1681.221s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's a great idea if we could utilize the buses when we have students that are staying after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1686.404s">[Cugno]</a>: But with that being said, I just want to make sure that the students that are there for this particular purpose and service are being addressed first in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1695.669s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't want to kick anybody off a bus, but if this is a program that we're going to be investing in, I want to make sure that everyone gets the best possible opportunity to utilize it the best we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1706.815s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1711.497s">[Cugno]</a>: Are we going to roll call on, not a roll call, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1714.378s">[Cugno]</a>: It was Mr. Benedetto that had put the motion in and Mr. Skerry had second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1718.94s">[Cugno]</a>: So all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1720.121s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1721.722s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1724.021s">[Cugno]</a>: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1741.566s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1744.547s">[Cugno]</a>: We will be passing that and starting up the program as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1749.762s">[Cugno]</a>: and placed in file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1751.144s">[Cugno]</a>: So recommendations to accept the gift to the Robotics Club, Mr. Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1876.851s">[Cugno]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1877.852s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1878.312s">[Cugno]</a>: If you could just make sure that during the year you left students are doing, especially when it comes to their competitions, we'd like to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1885.575s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1944.366s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1945.287s">[Cugno]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, is this like the sixth year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.208s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1947.888s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1948.669s">[Cugno]</a>: Seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1951.05s">[Cugno]</a>: And again, we appreciate all that he's done, all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1955.425s">[Cugno]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1970.992s">[Cugno]</a>: I should have known better than to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1974.874s">[Cugno]</a>: It's the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1976.855s">[Cugno]</a>: They're building this for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1978.776s">[Cugno]</a>: So may I interrupt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1982.497s">[Cugno]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1984.739s">[Cugno]</a>: Vander Kloof, I believe it was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2496.63s">[Cugno]</a>: Before I pass it on to anybody else, I just want, I have a couple of questions and that is, how long is this grant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2505.498s">[Cugno]</a>: And this is our second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2507.6s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh, OK, because we got it approved last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2510.002s">[Cugno]</a>: So this is, OK, three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2511.803s">[Cugno]</a>: And then, just because it's been such a great program, and already there's been so much going on, at the end of the three years, have they already discussed, like, what the process is going to be, if you're going to be able to reapply for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2525.534s">[Cugno]</a>: So we are going to be able to reapply, or is this, like, one of those, you can't reapply for it for a certain amount of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2545.686s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if this is more of a question for you or for Mr. Skorka, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2551.237s">[Cugno]</a>: I know already you have so much on here, but just to throw it out, I know a lot of the time when I've gone to the senior centers, they ask us about our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2565.009s">[Cugno]</a>: And some of the seniors, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to be with our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2571.094s">[Cugno]</a>: with our high school students, I meant to say, with our high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2574.436s">[Cugno]</a>: So you hear, you know, certain stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2576.157s">[Cugno]</a>: And I've heard this year, you know, well, if you're on the school committee, then why don't you try to teach those young folks some manners or some respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2585.863s">[Cugno]</a>: And when I hear things like that, I get very upset because they're touching my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2591.607s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know the type of kids that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2594.208s">[Cugno]</a>: So if you have the opportunity, because I tell them all the time that our kids do have respect and they do have manners, and you'd be very surprised at what our kids do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2603.911s">[Cugno]</a>: If we have the opportunity and if you could throw that in your schedule somehow, somewhere, I would really like to see that collaboration going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2612.073s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it would be amazing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2614.734s">[Cugno]</a>: just as much as it's amazing for us and our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2617.095s">[Cugno]</a>: I know bringing my own kids with me to certain events that I didn't think maybe, you know, the senior center would be happy to have kids when they were younger, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2626.361s">[Cugno]</a>: It was amazing when I left there, because they loved that interaction, and my kids actually love the interaction of hearing all these different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2634.666s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's nice, they're here, they're in our center of our square, they're in the center of the heart of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2640.169s">[Cugno]</a>: It would be nice for them to know what type of students we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2644.362s">[Cugno]</a>: So Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3406.189s">[Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3407.45s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, I had a lady who approached me on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3409.591s">[Cugno]</a>: And she was extremely thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3412.233s">[Cugno]</a>: that we were, that you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3413.994s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not going to say we, you guys were doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3416.716s">[Cugno]</a>: And they were very happy because they actually had the interaction with the young kids and they got to learn something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3423.4s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess what I was looking to is that not everyone goes to those classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3427.282s">[Cugno]</a>: So I know that they get together on a Friday at lunchtime, especially around the holiday times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3433.044s">[Cugno]</a>: And around the year, they have certain lunches that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3435.405s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know why, because our kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3437.466s">[Cugno]</a>: But if there's ever that opportunity to go there, just introduce themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3443.668s">[Cugno]</a>: Tell them what you're there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3445.128s">[Cugno]</a>: And maybe solicit more people for the programs that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3449.99s">[Cugno]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3451.21s">[Cugno]</a>: That was what I was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3452.591s">[Cugno]</a>: I did hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3453.871s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's a fabulous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3457.874s">[Cugno]</a>: That's it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.755s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3459.916s">[Cugno]</a>: So are we going to introduce the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3731.565s">[Cugno]</a>: And my, yes, and my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3738.488s">[Cugno]</a>: Very certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3739.569s">[Cugno]</a>: That's fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3740.309s">[Cugno]</a>: That's absolutely fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3741.629s">[Cugno]</a>: And hearing stories, and everyone can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3744.431s">[Cugno]</a>: You don't have to, you know, you made yourself special by doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3748.172s">[Cugno]</a>: And you also represented the students in your school doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3752.274s">[Cugno]</a>: Talk about a great way of opening up your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3755.195s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, and opening up your mind that for the sake of, you know, for anybody, it could have been us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3760.92s">[Cugno]</a>: It could be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3761.52s">[Cugno]</a>: So if you treat someone like that, it's always going to be successful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3765.684s">[Cugno]</a>: And lucky enough, you know, you have parents, you have your father who decided that he was going to take this quality drive with his daughter for three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3775.852s">[Cugno]</a>: So that's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3776.973s">[Cugno]</a>: So anybody else on our committee would like to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3779.575s">[Cugno]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3860.511s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3983.739s">[Cugno]</a>: When you say that you actually, do you, when students come to the school, do you actually approach them and try to like introduce them to other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4036.427s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4037.716s">[Cugno]</a>: And are you going to pass the baton over to anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4041.528s">[Cugno]</a>: And up next is Kayla Malone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4043.855s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4177.69s">[Cugno]</a>: The workshops that you had, were they videotaped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4186.355s">[Cugno]</a>: But are they playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4187.876s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they playing on our studio station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4191.46s">[Cugno]</a>: Because that might be something that I think would be very beneficial for all of you, but also to have people see what you're doing, the creative workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4200.223s">[Cugno]</a>: Something like your workshop is definitely something that could be videotaped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4204.084s">[Cugno]</a>: Even what the girls have been doing, I think, is something that would be beneficial if you can't do the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4208.565s">[Cugno]</a>: But even a piece of it, just to really show off what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4213.587s">[Cugno]</a>: you know, going to Texas and seeing the faces and what your abilities have done to other people and just to show their faces and their gratitude and how they react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4224.157s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, and the same thing with the girls, you know, having students come in from different countries and knowing that there's this type of, you know, a lending hand, per se, that you're not going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4235.947s">[Cugno]</a>: We're going to be there to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4237.268s">[Cugno]</a>: I think it's very beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4239.543s">[Cugno]</a>: play that on our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4241.084s">[Cugno]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.444s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4242.664s">[Cugno]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.532s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4318.852s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4319.133s">[Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, Mr. Spock, you had said that you're working with the Columbus, the Brooks, what were the other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4327.55s">[Cugno]</a>: McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4328.771s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, so everybody's included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4377.963s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4378.523s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4438.698s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, I pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4440.659s">[Cugno]</a>: Do we have a motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4442.501s">[Cugno]</a>: I think we're all set, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4443.321s">[Cugno]</a>: Can I entertain a motion to accept this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4447.384s">[Cugno]</a>: By Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4448.745s">[Cugno]</a>: Second by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4450.166s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.087s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4451.647s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4453.903s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, seven in the affirmative, the report of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has been placed on file, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4461.851s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just want to throw something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4464.574s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that everybody said thank you to a lot of people, but this is when we talk about networking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4470.759s">[Cugno]</a>: And it was the superintendent, because it was with his networking and going out there and talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4476.602s">[Cugno]</a>: And when he hears about an idea that he knows that it's going to benefit us, whether we agree or disagree at times, the superintendent does bring back so much to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4487.488s">[Cugno]</a>: And this, this particular program, is something that the superintendent definitely worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4492.993s">[Cugno]</a>: And it was with his networking and finding the people that did it, and showing them there's a reason to come to Medford, and there's a reason of why they should accept us for their grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4505.963s">[Cugno]</a>: So I just wanted to recognize him for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4508.565s">[Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4509.965s">[Cugno]</a>: And now for the report statement of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4512.486s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4513.326s">[Cugno]</a>: Report on statement of interest application to NSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4517.207s">[Cugno]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.174s">[Cugno]</a>: And?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4672.508s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to actually, can I ask the mayor a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.552s">[Cugno]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4676.732s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is, so you're going to go back to this in April for re-approval or is it going to be starting... No, it's going to go back into the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4686.622s">[Cugno]</a>: A new application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4687.463s">[Cugno]</a>: So a new application means we have to pay the fee again for... No, there's no fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4691.206s">[Cugno]</a>: No fee, just the approval, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4692.588s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so I just want to make sure that that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4695.09s">[Cugno]</a>: the way that is, but in the meantime, I know that as a committee, we've spoken about certain things that we want it done, and we were kind of hoping it was going to be incorporated into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4705.615s">[Cugno]</a>: With this not being accepted now, and we don't know when it will be accepted if we go for it in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4713.378s">[Cugno]</a>: What happens to the projects that we were thinking of doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4716.642s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they just going to get postponed until we find out if we're going to get approved, or are we going to look at it as a committee and start really looking at it and saying, we really need to do certain things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4748.434s">[Cugno]</a>: So with the motion from Mr. Skerry, do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4751.077s">[Cugno]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4752.478s">[Cugno]</a>: Second by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4754.4s">[Cugno]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4755.281s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4756.182s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4758.837s">[Cugno]</a>: Six affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4761.819s">[Cugno]</a>: The motion to place the report on file is passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4765.841s">[Cugno]</a>: Report on security cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5136.689s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so could I entertain the motion of having a meeting of the whole set up for middle of January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5153.452s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, so motion is to have a committee of the whole meeting for our security cameras to discuss our security cameras as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5163.04s">[Cugno]</a>: Made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.003s">[Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5166.963s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5168.024s">[Cugno]</a>: Any opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5169.826s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion passes, and we will have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5172.568s">[Cugno]</a>: Did you receive and place this report on file?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5174.63s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5178.723s">[Cugno]</a>: Recommendation to approve school lunch charge, I mean, sorry, charge policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5191.502s">[Cugno]</a>: Just for clarification, change policy or charge policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5827.29s">[Cugno]</a>: And so, as you just clarified, this is something that we have to do because we're being, it's by government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5834.594s">[Cugno]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5835.415s">[Cugno]</a>: But the amount is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.415s">[Cugno]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5960.675s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.536s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5961.596s">[Cugno]</a>: Van der Klooten, and then we'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.009s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6273.629s">[Cugno]</a>: I guess what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6275.849s">[Cugno]</a>: Vanden Heuvel said, if the parents are going to be called anyway, because that is going to be an underbalance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6286.431s">[Cugno]</a>: They're going to be called and said, gee, you have extra, you have minus balance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6291.552s">[Cugno]</a>: Does it really matter if it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6293.47s">[Cugno]</a>: a cheeseburger or if it's a salad, I mean, they're going to be under the amount no matter what, and they'll be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6300.079s">[Cugno]</a>: So I guess my suggestion for this, and I know that you still want to speak, but my suggestion for this is that why don't we look at this and approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6311.979s">[Cugno]</a>: what you need to be approved as far as what we need for the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6315.382s">[Cugno]</a>: So we have that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6316.984s">[Cugno]</a>: But don't approve, make it separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6319.266s">[Cugno]</a>: And don't approve the amount until maybe you could come back with something a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6537.507s">[Cugno]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.508s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6538.728s">[Cugno]</a>: So by Mr. Benedetto, the motion is to check the wording to the document and bringing it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6574.599s">[Cugno]</a>: So I guess the motion is to check the documentation to see what it meets, to bring it back to the school committee, and also to make sure that we have the actual terminology on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6586.182s">[Cugno]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6587.202s">[Cugno]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6588.203s">[Cugno]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6590.15s">[Cugno]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6591.23s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion to place this on file for our following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6610.078s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6611.878s">[Cugno]</a>: And thank you to Stop and Shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6616.201s">[Cugno]</a>: to send out a letter of recognition and thanking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6619.565s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin, I think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6621.287s">[Cugno]</a>: Did you still want to say something on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6656.35s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.69s">[Cugno]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6657.97s">[Cugno]</a>: Negotiations and legal matters, there are none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6663.3s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6664.381s">[Cugno]</a>: And two items under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6665.661s">[Cugno]</a>: May I have a motion to entertain?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6667.743s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6670.104s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6671.865s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.206s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6674.947s">[Cugno]</a>: Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6729.609s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7501.75s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7578.228s">[Cugno]</a>: Someone said I was completely correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7585.129s">[Cugno]</a>: First and only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7586.35s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to you, staff, for doing it in such a professional manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7594.531s">[Cugno]</a>: And you really did expedite it very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7596.752s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just want to say thank you for that, because it was taken under control very quickly with your staff, with the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7604.033s">[Cugno]</a>: And Justin, I stand here and sometimes over the years I kind of think that, you know, what's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7613.255s">[Cugno]</a>: And then I hear someone like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7615.516s">[Cugno]</a>: And you just make it so refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7617.236s">[Cugno]</a>: And you really do make me feel that I'm not crazy sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7620.857s">[Cugno]</a>: That we have to be sensible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7623.098s">[Cugno]</a>: We're not saying, of course, that this particular situation was the cause of any particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7628.639s">[Cugno]</a>: But we have to get back to a society where we have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7633.557s">[Cugno]</a>: our responsibilities, that there are repercussions, and that we have to abide by some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7639.76s">[Cugno]</a>: And we're becoming young adults, and you are going to be leaving the four walls of those high schools, of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7645.963s">[Cugno]</a>: So it's very refreshing to hear that you understand you can't just be a free-for-all all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7653.226s">[Cugno]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7873.564s">[Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perola, you said 630?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7885.208s">[Cugno]</a>: I just wanted to ask real quick, what are the repercussions right now if they are getting caught with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7892.774s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it based on cigarette smoking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7911.108s">[Cugno]</a>: And could you just quickly, for people that don't know what the repercussion is, what is it, if it's looked upon as tobacco, what are the repercussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7967.839s">[Cugno]</a>: And is it addressed the same way if it's marijuana or any other type of drug?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7976.532s">[Cugno]</a>: And you're definitely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7978.333s">[Cugno]</a>: You have to bring in the family or the guardian or whoever is dealing with that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7983.136s">[Cugno]</a>: But you have programs that go along with that type of repercussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.778s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7986.939s">[Cugno]</a>: So it's not just I'm suspending you from school for a week and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8024.758s">[Cugno]</a>: When you have these, when you've been having these types of discussions, is it, I'm just curious in knowing if students are thinking because now it's been legalized that it's not as bad anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8037.124s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, they just don't think it's anything bad anymore because, oh well, it's legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8191.398s">[Cugno]</a>: Kathy, did you have your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8507.737s">[Cugno]</a>: Justin, I know you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8626.83s">[Cugno]</a>: I think basically the point of information on this is really the educational piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8631.653s">[Cugno]</a>: But an educational piece not only for, as you said, students and faculty, but this is definitely something that we all have to have our ears and eyes open about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8641.1s">[Cugno]</a>: It's unfortunate because it's not a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8644.682s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a country issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8646.623s">[Cugno]</a>: This is a worldwide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8649.485s">[Cugno]</a>: But, you know, the bottom line is we're also concerned about our back door and our backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8656.25s">[Cugno]</a>: So we want to make sure that our kids are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8657.991s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think just opening up and talking more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8660.913s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, as you said, Justin, we don't have all the statistics yet about this, you know, like we do about the cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8666.857s">[Cugno]</a>: But we don't want to get there either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8668.638s">[Cugno]</a>: And the more and more I'm having these conversations about this, it seems that it's almost like a challenge, a challenge that kids are having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8677.064s">[Cugno]</a>: just to like, if they can get away with it type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.107s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8681.607s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, I'm not saying that they don't want to do it, but it just seems like even the example you just gave, that when you were walking by, it's like, OK, could I fool them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8689.533s">[Cugno]</a>: Could I get away with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8690.915s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that has a huge component to it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8694.077s">[Cugno]</a>: But the educational piece of just letting them know, you're right, we don't have the statistics yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8699.701s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, they made it legal, but it doesn't, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8702.003s">[Cugno]</a>: This is what really could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8703.785s">[Cugno]</a>: And I just think that that's an important piece, but definitely a piece that parents have to be involved in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8851.738s">[Cugno]</a>: Do I have a motion to revert back into the regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.164s">[Cugno]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8858.564s">[Cugno]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8864.289s">[Cugno]</a>: Seconded by Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.107s">[Cugno]</a>: You were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9256.888s">[Cugno]</a>: You were a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9259.11s">[Cugno]</a>: We were all parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9871.496s">[Cugno]</a>: I just want to say thank you to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9876.559s">[Cugno]</a>: I was going to write something and then there's just not enough time for all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9882.83s">[Cugno]</a>: This was a decision I made, and it is time for new ears, new eyes, but very important to keep the old ones too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9892.854s">[Cugno]</a>: Everybody comes from a different perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9896.475s">[Cugno]</a>: The one thing that when I started, I started with, I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9901.557s">[Cugno]</a>: the new member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9903.317s">[Cugno]</a>: And within the next term, I became a senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9907.938s">[Cugno]</a>: A lot of friends that year called and said, I think I'm going to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9912.239s">[Cugno]</a>: And they were lucky enough to get on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9915.24s">[Cugno]</a>: One thing that I really urge this committee to do is keep the private and personal agendas outside that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9923.843s">[Cugno]</a>: and keep what's important in here, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9928.064s">[Cugno]</a>: I said I was going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9929.565s">[Cugno]</a>: So, with that being said, always make the decisions of what the kids need and not about what you want done to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9940.768s">[Cugno]</a>: It's very important that it's about the kids, it's about the budget, it's about knowing what your positions on this committee are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9951.213s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't want to be disrespectful to any PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9955.215s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9956.475s">[Cugno]</a>: I've been on the side councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9958.176s">[Cugno]</a>: This is not a glorified PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9960.577s">[Cugno]</a>: We have to abide by rules, regulations, the state and federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9965.699s">[Cugno]</a>: And sometimes things seem very easy, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9969.901s">[Cugno]</a>: So with that being said, I just want to say thank you to all of you, to the superintendent who always has his door open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9981.007s">[Cugno]</a>: This was my decision, I'm crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9982.689s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank God I didn't get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9984.771s">[Cugno]</a>: It wasn't because I didn't want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9988.516s">[Cugno]</a>: He opened up the door and to the administrators, Diane Caldwell, Beverly Nelson, the principals that I had worked with, the mayor's office, past and present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10000.67s">[Cugno]</a>: Dr. Perrella, really all of the principals have always had an open door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10008.956s">[Cugno]</a>: When I can't track the superintendent down, I track him down because I will run to his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10014.62s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think there were days that he probably said, oh my God, another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10017.903s">[Cugno]</a>: What is she gonna come up with today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10019.564s">[Cugno]</a>: But all in all, it was just a wonderful ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10023.687s">[Cugno]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without the people back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10028.11s">[Cugno]</a>: Oh my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10031.999s">[Cugno]</a>: When I decided to run, it was a family decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10035.08s">[Cugno]</a>: My family has been there through and through, except for the boys tonight who probably were saying to themselves, I wish I was still in school for the next couple of days, because they just got home from college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10045.964s">[Cugno]</a>: And Michelle was probably thinking, I wish I had one more final tonight so I don't have to sit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10050.305s">[Cugno]</a>: But other than that, to my husband, to my son, Michael, who came, and to everyone, really, who has always been there for me to make me look good back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10060.469s">[Cugno]</a>: Work with your minds, but really work with your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10093.578s">[Cugno]</a>: There's no more, I have plenty of life, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=10096.328s">[Cugno]</a>: This was the relaxing part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8319.267s">[Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.731s">[Cugno]</a>: Well sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8341.872s">[Cugno]</a>: You might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8343.253s">[Cugno]</a>: It could be someone else that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8345.494s">[Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8346.175s">[Cugno]</a>: Their cell phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8347.435s">[Cugno]</a>: And were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8349.116s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8354.58s">[Cugno]</a>: And as my colleague said I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8357.702s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8438.547s">[Cugno]</a>: points of information they are very.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8441.569s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to address the street alleys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8445.071s">[Cugno]</a>: The question of the discussion actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8447.432s">[Cugno]</a>: In my in my came out with a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8452.635s">[Cugno]</a>: Cushion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8453.796s">[Cugno]</a>: Policy and a probably about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8456.517s">[Cugno]</a>: Six years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8459.819s">[Cugno]</a>: That everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.402s">[Cugno]</a>: to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8465.882s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8472.285s">[Cugno]</a>: And that is the coaches have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8474.507s">[Cugno]</a>: Administration has to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8475.927s">[Cugno]</a>: The students have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8477.468s">[Cugno]</a>: The parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8479.189s">[Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8484.051s">[Cugno]</a>: Nurses the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8493.796s">[Cugno]</a>: uh... fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8520.731s">[Cugno]</a>: to that trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8521.932s">[Cugno]</a>: Gets evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8523.312s">[Cugno]</a>: Has to go to a doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8525.133s">[Cugno]</a>: Will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8533.877s">[Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8539.5s">[Cugno]</a>: unless that trainer okays you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8542.481s">[Cugno]</a>: And unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8547.222s">[Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8548.223s">[Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8553.644s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8556.885s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8558.786s">[Cugno]</a>: player always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8562.953s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8566.518s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11180.089s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11186.256s">[Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11191.382s">[Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11192.863s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11199.73s">[Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.133s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11204.954s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11208.736s">[Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11209.917s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11213.6s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11215.001s">[Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11218.423s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11220.684s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11229.19s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11236.536s">[Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11240.539s">[Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11241.78s">[Cugno]</a>: It's happening, you know, for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11246.584s">[Cugno]</a>: Like, are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11249.706s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11254.89s">[Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11276.816s">[Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11286.628s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around, you know, is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11289.772s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11291.394s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11292.755s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, there's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11297.04s">[Cugno]</a>: We you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11300.645s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11305.552s">[Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11314.484s">[Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11318.829s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11332.563s">[Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11336.986s">[Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11440.683s">[Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11442.203s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11447.085s">[Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11452.007s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11459.989s">[Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11461.812s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11468.501s">[Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11470.664s">[Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11473.768s">[Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11475.33s">[Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11476.792s">[Cugno]</a>: just because they're not things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11479.395s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately we have seen situations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11493.894s">[Cugno]</a>: from you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11512.911s">[Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11529.878s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11533.2s">[Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11538.282s">[Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11539.623s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11546.346s">[Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11560.911s">[Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11561.971s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11563.872s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11573.815s">[Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11578.256s">[Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11584.677s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11588.278s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11595.103s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11597.145s">[Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11606.311s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11607.312s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11612.916s">[Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11679.92s">[Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11682.281s">[Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11684.582s">[Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11688.464s">[Cugno]</a>: to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11690.906s">[Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11693.288s">[Cugno]</a>: But what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11694.469s">[Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11695.95s">[Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11712.751s">[Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11721.215s">[Cugno]</a>: Like when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11729.6s">[Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11736.403s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11905.411s">[Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11916.043s">[Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11920.988s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11921.988s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11924.509s">[Cugno]</a>: I just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11942.634s">[Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11945.195s">[Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12870.554s">[Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.095s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.235s">[Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12871.695s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.464s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12880.964s">[Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12882.546s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12883.366s">[Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12887.19s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12892.715s">[Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12895.356s">[Cugno]</a>: Because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.159s">[Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12904.639s">[Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12905.919s">[Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12907.46s">[Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14409.295s">[Cugno]</a>: Miss Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14411.777s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14416.301s">[Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14421.746s">[Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14426.77s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14441.299s">[Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14449.684s">[Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14452.566s">[Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14459.332s">[Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14469.4s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14471.542s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14512.822s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14513.963s">[Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14528.115s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14533.038s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14536.821s">[Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14544.565s">[Cugno]</a>: because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15222.981s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15255.542s">[Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15339.459s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, outside of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15871.718s">[Cugno]</a>: clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15894.688s">[Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15903.199s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15904.881s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15907.124s">[Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16284.036s">[Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=99.231s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=725.318s">[Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=745.781s">[Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=747.903s">[Cugno]</a>: They might do it if the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=749.344s">[Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=751.387s">[Cugno]</a>: Not their Facebook, their cell phone and were filming too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=755.17s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=759.695s">[Cugno]</a>: okay let me let me if I can mayor let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=862.066s">[Cugno]</a>: It's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=867.209s">[Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, the administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=883.678s">[Cugno]</a>: have to go through it, and at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=891.666s">[Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=900.094s">[Cugno]</a>: Fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=906.981s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=922.211s">[Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=931.117s">[Cugno]</a>: will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=939.88s">[Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=947.563s">[Cugno]</a>: And, unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=953.204s">[Cugno]</a>: It happened on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=954.204s">[Cugno]</a>: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=959.625s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, I understand that the student, the player wanted to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=962.846s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, it's like everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=964.586s">[Cugno]</a>: The player always wants to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=966.226s">[Cugno]</a>: But we as adults have to take responsibility, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=968.927s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=970.087s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=971.207s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=972.487s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=976.848s">[Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3585.798s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.499s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3586.679s">[Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.359s">[Cugno]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3587.819s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3592.061s">[Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important, and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3597.183s">[Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3598.664s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3600.345s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out, are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3609.949s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3610.77s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3614.551s">[Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3615.732s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3619.334s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3620.815s">[Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3624.237s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3626.498s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3635.003s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, not that I'm saying that, no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3642.366s">[Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends, it's happening after school, it's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3652.491s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3655.553s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3660.695s">[Cugno]</a>: Or is it for our drama students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3662.859s">[Cugno]</a>: And I'm not picking on clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3664.421s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying as examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3666.785s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in, or a team that they're on, or a debate after school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3675.979s">[Cugno]</a>: that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3681.243s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think for us all, I think it would be very important to know because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3692.431s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3695.593s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3697.214s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3698.815s">[Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3702.857s">[Cugno]</a>: We, you have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3705.8s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3711.364s">[Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3720.292s">[Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3724.655s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but the interventions, if you find that there's a group of students that are having a party, and then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3742.829s">[Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3744.85s">[Cugno]</a>: No, those numbers are very low, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3846.491s">[Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3848.012s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else, but the bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3857.821s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3865.788s">[Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3867.649s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3874.31s">[Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3876.471s">[Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3879.572s">[Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3881.172s">[Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3885.254s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3890.055s">[Cugno]</a>: But unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, you know, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3909.571s">[Cugno]</a>: Or gee, you know, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them, you know, here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3914.215s">[Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3918.759s">[Cugno]</a>: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3921.301s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying, if our administration, if teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time, and it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3939.057s">[Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3943.662s">[Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3946.044s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean, my opinion is it's because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3963.197s">[Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3966.78s">[Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3967.821s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3969.722s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are, like, smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3979.691s">[Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3984.055s">[Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3990.517s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=3994.199s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4000.941s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4003.002s">[Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4008.704s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't know if it's the mentality of it all, and we could do it, it's not a big deal, it's not as bad as the cigarettes, because we don't have anything healthier yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4018.689s">[Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4085.883s">[Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4087.985s">[Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4090.407s">[Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the way to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it, and they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4100.295s">[Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4101.776s">[Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4118.569s">[Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4135.163s">[Cugno]</a>: So because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4151.522s">[Cugno]</a>: with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4309.695s">[Cugno]</a>: Well, that's why I was saying, I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just, as you mentioned, scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes, and so this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4326.769s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4328.069s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4330.27s">[Cugno]</a>: I just for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and and asks another, you know, another student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4346.735s">[Cugno]</a>: At least they know that, gee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4348.415s">[Cugno]</a>: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4350.957s">[Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5274.356s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.277s">[Cugno]</a>: One more question, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5276.957s">[Cugno]</a>: Cuneo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5277.417s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle with someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5288.3s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah, which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5292.942s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't and I think that would be a bullet point really put out there, because I don't think people are aware of how serious that could be, because we're you know, we've been trained in our mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5304.005s">[Cugno]</a>: And as as kids, we've been trained in our minds to is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5309.887s">[Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5310.387s">[Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5311.648s">[Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5313.188s">[Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6814.955s">[Cugno]</a>: Esconia, I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6820.217s">[Cugno]</a>: You won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6821.958s">[Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6826.24s">[Cugno]</a>: But I'm going to ask you a question when students come to the place and they speak a different language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6831.863s">[Cugno]</a>: They I know that we have specific classes to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like like to go to lunch with or anything like that that already that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6846.953s">[Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6850.995s">[Cugno]</a>: But many years ago, going here, we had students that came in from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6855.338s">[Cugno]</a>: I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6858.22s">[Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6864.985s">[Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe speak the language that they're here and in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6875.032s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6877.133s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6918.459s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6919.561s">[Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce it to their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6926.732s">[Cugno]</a>: And, you know, that way, at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.061s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6933.782s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6938.705s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6942.466s">[Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6949.57s">[Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6955.613s">[Cugno]</a>: but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7624.148s">[Cugno]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7628.449s">[Cugno]</a>: Prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7629.569s">[Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7661.144s">[Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes depending on our schedule if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7675.671s">[Cugno]</a>: until after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7745.06s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed like at an E.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8277.197s">[Cugno]</a>: A clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8278.618s">[Cugno]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8279.058s">[Cugno]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8283.682s">[Cugno]</a>: There is, I mean, I know that there's a large group that have computers, but there's also a large group out there that doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8290.887s">[Cugno]</a>: And so I just want to make sure, you know, not everything translates from on-site to actually hot copy as easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8300.274s">[Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8308.765s">[Cugno]</a>: Okay, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8310.446s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out, you're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8679.789s">[Cugno]</a>: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8689.596s">[Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8699.504s">[Cugno]</a>: What if they don't even bring it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8705.531s">[Cugno]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=107.406s">[Cugno]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=108.046s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=734.233s">[Cugno]</a>: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=754.679s">[Cugno]</a>: Well, sometimes it depends on the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=757.081s">[Cugno]</a>: It could be someone out there that just had their cell phone and were filming, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=764.068s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to see what type of play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=765.51s">[Cugno]</a>: If there is something out there, at least we could see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=773.017s">[Cugno]</a>: Especially when you're up there, I know the first thing is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the player is asked to step off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=853.494s">[Cugno]</a>: Points of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=854.874s">[Cugno]</a>: Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.794s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=855.934s">[Cugno]</a>: Bonilla?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=856.515s">[Cugno]</a>: Just to address Mr. Trincali's question or discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=861.856s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=864.137s">[Cugno]</a>: The MIA came out with a concussion rule, a concussion policy mandate probably about, it's been six years since Michelle's been gone, so about six years ago, that everyone had to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=876.141s">[Cugno]</a>: The ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=880.722s">[Cugno]</a>: themselves, their organization, because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through, and that is the coaches have to go through it, administration has to go through it, the students have to go through it, the parents have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=894.087s">[Cugno]</a>: And at that point in time, and of course, athletic directors had to go through it, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=900.57s">[Cugno]</a>: The only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it were the referees, which I thought was completely ironic, because they were the ones that called the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=908.973s">[Cugno]</a>: fought long and hard enough, it finally came true, and the referees have also have to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=914.576s">[Cugno]</a>: And just to give you a quick policy on that, when a student has a concussion, our athletic trainer actually, before the season begins, tests all our children, and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion strategies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=931.103s">[Cugno]</a>: If by any chance a child does get hurt on the field, then that child has to go back to that trainer, gets evaluated, has to go to a doctor, will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=948.776s">[Cugno]</a>: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field unless that trainer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.181s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming the coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=956.821s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=957.801s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=959.182s">[Cugno]</a>: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=985.746s">[Cugno]</a>: No, the superintendent is working with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3594.847s">[Cugno]</a>: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3601.034s">[Cugno]</a>: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3606.16s">[Cugno]</a>: So I want to say thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3607.661s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3614.508s">[Cugno]</a>: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3618.891s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it weekends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3619.732s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3623.494s">[Cugno]</a>: Why are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3624.695s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it just as an experimental, one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3628.378s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it because they're bored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3629.779s">[Cugno]</a>: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3633.201s">[Cugno]</a>: You know, different questions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3635.462s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there anything like that in the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3643.968s">[Cugno]</a>: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3651.314s">[Cugno]</a>: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3655.297s">[Cugno]</a>: It's happening after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3656.538s">[Cugno]</a>: It's happening for our students that are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3661.462s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it more when it's not their season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3664.504s">[Cugno]</a>: Are they doing it when it's not their hockey season, or their soccer season, or their football season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3669.648s">[Cugno]</a>: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3691.611s">[Cugno]</a>: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these stats go, OK, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3701.374s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around final exams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3704.536s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3706.156s">[Cugno]</a>: Is it around the parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3707.777s">[Cugno]</a>: There's so many variables, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3712.275s">[Cugno]</a>: You have done this survey now for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3714.736s">[Cugno]</a>: As a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3720.318s">[Cugno]</a>: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students and why they're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3729.262s">[Cugno]</a>: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3733.607s">[Cugno]</a>: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3747.362s">[Cugno]</a>: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3751.787s">[Cugno]</a>: Have we found those numbers to go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3855.441s">[Cugno]</a>: I just think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3856.962s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3861.844s">[Cugno]</a>: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3866.786s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3874.75s">[Cugno]</a>: and certain things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3876.591s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as to go back to kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3883.272s">[Cugno]</a>: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3885.453s">[Cugno]</a>: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3888.534s">[Cugno]</a>: Nowadays, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3890.114s">[Cugno]</a>: But that doesn't mean that just because they're not, things aren't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3894.195s">[Cugno]</a>: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately, we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately, we have seen situations from, you know, it hits the media or whatever that, well, gee, parents think, well, my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway, so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3918.551s">[Cugno]</a>: Or, gee, they're gonna be doing that anyway, so why don't we have them here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3923.174s">[Cugno]</a>: So just because they're not in a so-called park, I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3930.279s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's why I was saying if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3939.105s">[Cugno]</a>: or anything like that, you know, hey, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3944.67s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3948.013s">[Cugno]</a>: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3953.078s">[Cugno]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3955.02s">[Cugno]</a>: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3961.158s">[Cugno]</a>: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3972.149s">[Cugno]</a>: Now, like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3975.733s">[Cugno]</a>: And I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3976.794s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it this summer especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3978.296s">[Cugno]</a>: I've seen it, like, you know, people just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3981.099s">[Cugno]</a>: smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3988.645s">[Cugno]</a>: And here we were years ago saying, well, gee, do you know what secondhand smoking does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3993.069s">[Cugno]</a>: Now we have to explain to our kids, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=3999.294s">[Cugno]</a>: And it's a very, very concerning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4003.198s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4007.441s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4009.903s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4011.965s">[Cugno]</a>: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4021.132s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4022.113s">[Cugno]</a>: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4027.677s">[Cugno]</a>: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4092.99s">[Cugno]</a>: I'd be very interested to start doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4095.332s">[Cugno]</a>: Just two more questions real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4096.953s">[Cugno]</a>: One is to both Tony and Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4099.355s">[Cugno]</a>: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping, to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4106.499s">[Cugno]</a>: And they know what the next steps are, but what do the students know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4109.261s">[Cugno]</a>: What are their next steps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4110.722s">[Cugno]</a>: If they're caught with it, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4127.529s">[Cugno]</a>: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools, like when they have parent-teacher nights, or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4144.413s">[Cugno]</a>: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out, because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4151.215s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk, or maybe even have a five-minute discussion with the audience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4320.173s">[Cugno]</a>: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4330.784s">[Cugno]</a>: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4335.749s">[Cugno]</a>: And I know that you've had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4339.993s">[Cugno]</a>: For people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee, they don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4358.271s">[Cugno]</a>: necessarily call you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4359.932s">[Cugno]</a>: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5283.343s">[Cugno]</a>: Is there a motion to receive this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.264s">[Cugno]</a>: One more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.805s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5285.945s">[Cugno]</a>: Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5286.405s">[Cugno]</a>: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into a vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.172s">[Cugno]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5295.673s">[Cugno]</a>: With someone who's been vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5297.274s">[Cugno]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5298.115s">[Cugno]</a>: Which is very important and it's very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5302.058s">[Cugno]</a>: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5307.442s">[Cugno]</a>: People are aware of how serious that could be because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind and as kids we've been trained in our minds too is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5318.875s">[Cugno]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5319.356s">[Cugno]</a>: No one's been talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5320.637s">[Cugno]</a>: This is, you know, newer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5322.179s">[Cugno]</a>: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6823.939s">[Cugno]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6824.119s">[Cugno]</a>: Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6826.441s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because we won't have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6830.966s">[Cugno]</a>: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I'm going to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6836.411s">[Cugno]</a>: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6841.435s">[Cugno]</a>: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6855.963s">[Cugno]</a>: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy and I remember my teacher actually asking me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6867.23s">[Cugno]</a>: to see if that student could, well, at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6873.999s">[Cugno]</a>: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6883.17s">[Cugno]</a>: and in English, and I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6886.131s">[Cugno]</a>: I don't even know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6927.483s">[Cugno]</a>: No, I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6928.624s">[Cugno]</a>: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they just come into a new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6942.059s">[Cugno]</a>: I mean, you know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6947.765s">[Cugno]</a>: to come in and not know the language is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6951.466s">[Cugno]</a>: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6958.587s">[Cugno]</a>: Because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, OK, you're going to be with that student every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6964.609s">[Cugno]</a>: But at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7637.809s">[Cugno]</a>: Prior discretion to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7667.342s">[Cugno]</a>: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7754.089s">[Cugno]</a>: And that's addressed, like, at a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8286.229s">[Cugno]</a>: a clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8309.298s">[Cugno]</a>: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8317.784s">[Cugno]</a>: OK, that's where the clarification is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8319.466s">[Cugno]</a>: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8321.707s">[Cugno]</a>: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8698.63s">[Cugno]</a>: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or two months or seven months, they don't even bring it to you.<br><br>
