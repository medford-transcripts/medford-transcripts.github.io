    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=600.726s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=602.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is the May 7th Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=607.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the agenda today is our annual surveillance report presentation from the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=616.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is from the community, I don't know what CCOP stands for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=623.56s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can't remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=625.521s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Community Control of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=631.65s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we are going to be reviewing the 2024 Annual Surveillance Report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=637.194s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would love to welcome Chief Buckley to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=640.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you so much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=644.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had some time to review it since April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=648.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And why don't you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=654.675s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Give me your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=655.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a couple of questions, but I'd love to hear a summary of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=660.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like 35 pages, so there's a lot in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=664.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Carry on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=921.187s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=923.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This being the first time you did the full year's worth of reporting, were there any issues you faced with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=932.03s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something that occurred to me right in the beginning is the, were there any complications with, I mean, everything's, is everything self-reported or you audited the, there was like random samples taken<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=947.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of certain incidents and then that was reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=951.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It wasn't really the officers reporting themselves, it was that the team that was doing the audits was reviewing the data from the camera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1004.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Two things that I noticed in the review of the data that was pulled is that it seems like it's still difficult for everybody to remember to take their cameras, probably just because it's still kind of a new process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1015.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And somebody is running out and they put their camera down or they're charging it and they ran out without it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1021.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the second thing is something that I noticed really consistently is, did the officer advise all involved they were being recorded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1028.518s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In the audits, in the general incident audit, more often than not, they're not advising people that they're being recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1036.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that like another thing about having to rewire your brain, it's the first thing you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1105.429s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I had one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1108.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there, I was hoping when I was looking at the data that it might be at the beginning of the year that there would be higher incidence of forgetting or not advising people that they were being recorded, but I didn't notice that pattern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1124.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I was wondering if I could ask, and maybe this is a question for you, Lieutenant, if there are methods being implemented to remediate those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1241.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, Vice President Collins is number four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1246.445s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2607.703s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2609.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I had two interactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2610.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Malden also has body-worn cameras, and I had two interactions at the Malden Warming Center this winter with some officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2619.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One was an extremely chaotic night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2621.554s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was not the first person to see the officer and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2625.297s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was running back and forth in the center and I ran back and talked to him to help them address a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2632.781s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I didn't hear him say, you're being recorded but I think it was probably because he said it when he walked in the door to somebody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2642.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2644.408s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was somebody that I talked to outside who was just asking if we were at capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2649.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he said, do I have your consent to record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2652.594s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I was like, yeah, why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2654.296s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he was like, are you guys at capacity tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2656.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I was like, we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2656.858s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he was like, OK, bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2658.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was the whole interaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2660.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was like, you recorded that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2661.201s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2662.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But every single time, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2664.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But even, I mean, even the first interaction, I don't doubt that he said it, he probably did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2670.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just missed it because I was, it was an extremely chaotic night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2674.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, it's, but I think muscle memory is exactly it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2679.97s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just part of the thing, you know, after a while,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2684.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: probably when they first did Miranda roads, it was the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2686.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And people didn't weren't used to saying them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2689.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then now they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2692.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate your all of your responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2696.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it seems like you're very thoughtful about the ways you're going about handling this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2701.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2703.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan has had her mic request on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2707.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2853.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2856.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3205.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you guys presenting this report to us with so much thoroughness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3212.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's our first time seeing it to this degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3216.348s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a new technology, it's a new ordinance with the reporting requirement, and it's our first time having access to this level of data, and we're also learning about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3228.936s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how you process the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3230.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we've had a lot of questions today and I appreciate your comprehensive, thorough responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3236.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3239.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do any other councillors have any comments or questions at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3243.203s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none, I will, oh, one more, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3247.165s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3669.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, actually, I have the language from the Welcoming City Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3673.643s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says no city funds, resources, facilities, property, equipment, or personnel may be used to assist or participate in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, except as required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3686.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: or a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3687.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And what we're talking about is just the civil removal of people in violation of immigration laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3696.38s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So again, if it is an FBI operation, that's a separate thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3701.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's a criminal investigation, if somebody is, if there is a warrant for their arrest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3707.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that's legitimate, that's not what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3710.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we get a lot of inquiries about the stuff and we're following up on sometimes on questions that we get asked by our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3720.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate your- Yeah, at the risk of saying you may know more than me at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3837.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4287.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4289.069s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4293.875s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4295.94s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4322.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I noticed that, yeah, it looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4323.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There was a specific, yeah, I was, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4327.971s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The requests and, or that's on this page, but there's a chart where people requested the redactions and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4337.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4341.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will open it up to public participation in person or on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4345.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can have a seat and you can come up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4348.321s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Please say your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4352.085s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and I will alternate if there are folks who would like to speak on Sam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4444.455s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is the fault of the committee, not the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4449.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that is the fault of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4450.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4452.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, um, yeah, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4457.761s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4458.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4459.301s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The open meeting law requires 48 hours of notice, but I understand why your organization would want to meet and talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4467.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4468.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4470.524s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4474.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4545.348s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, and I didn't mean to imply that we were late in posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4551.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We were just we didn't happen to notify you guys ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4555.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But um, can you restate that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4558.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4576.894s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, let's hold on to it until after the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4579.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4581.394s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing no hands raised on Zoom, I will go to the podium again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4584.697s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: State your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4985.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do I have any?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4986.513s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5131.407s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that is in when somebody does a public records request, there will be redaction required, and that has a cost to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5140.33s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But if somebody within your policy around redaction for themselves requests a redaction there's no cost associated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5207.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5208.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5212.03s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do see one more public comment on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5588.331s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is everybody clear on what the motion is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5591.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5594.334s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5595.935s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5596.756s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5598.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As a point of information, question number two in the annual surveillance report says, whether the surveillance technology has been effective at achieving its identified purpose<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5610.969s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And one of the sentences in that says, body-worn cameras are effective law enforcement tools that reinforce the public's perception of police professionalism and preserve factual representations of officer-civilian interactions, which I would say covers most of the bases of both helping law enforcement achieve its goals and also helping the public<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5639.986s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: achieve its goals, be they the same or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5643.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think they're usually the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5646.551s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, do we have a motion otherwise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5651.975s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5653.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5656.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5656.778s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5658.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5659.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5659.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=972.429s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just looking at other neighboring cities, human rights commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=977.811s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville has seven members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=981.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cambridge, I can't find how many members on their website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=986.613s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not everybody has them, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=991.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What I like about nine is that it's the three through three is kind of nice and evenly split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=998.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1000.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: even number already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1002.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so I guess I'm not, uh, I don't have a concrete opinion, which makes me not want to argue one way or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1015.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that feels difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1017.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree if we have strongly held opinions from the public, I would be curious to hear them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1022.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but thank you for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1435.276s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, just from looking at other cities websites, Melrose has six members, Somerville has seven, Cambridge has 11, Arlington has 13, which is surprising, Revere has eight and Malden has nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1447.501s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So again, I don't, I would never served on the commission, I would defer to people who have as far as like strongly held opinions about, you know, reasons why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1459.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: one's better than another, I don't have a strong opinion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1462.835s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do, again, like Councilor Callahan, I think it's probably best for us to defer to those folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1470.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2288.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, yes, I would definitely be in support of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2293.597s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, a small stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2295.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know a few of our commissions have stipends attached them already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2299.36s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and boards of the Community Development Board has a stipend that meets very frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2304.742s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, um, and it's a really important, um, element of varsity government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2309.445s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I mean, this would also be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2312.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2313.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2315.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would be critical to the healthy functioning of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2319.062s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and it's also, you know, part of making sure that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2324.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just like council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2325.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need to repeat what Councilor Callahan said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2327.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, um Yeah, I think the stipend portion is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2330.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a budget line item is important again by the same token.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2337.217s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We shouldn't have to argue about pennies because it is a very large<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2340.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: budget, I do think that there is wiggle room here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2343.43s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that we do have capacity in these small amounts to allow this commission to have some of its own authority<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2355.755s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that's what we're trying to give it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2357.456s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't make sense to have a cross section of our residents that are truly representative if we're not giving them the authority to do things with that knowledge that they bring, um, into our city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2371.502s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2373.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2862.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Quick Google says that a mayor does generally have the power to both, if they have appointed somebody, they have the power to remove them for good cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2873.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So with that being, I think we should maybe add the words for good cause and then have an understanding of what that would mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2881.916s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think it would mean expressing an opinion contrary to the opinion of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2886.878s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is not about our current mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2888.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This would be about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2890.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: any mayor that we would have in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2893.015s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So not to assume anything about, it's like a differing opinion, I don't think would be considered good cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2900.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would be something egregious, would be a good cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2905.803s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It does say sometimes it would be with approval of the council, maybe with the rest of the commission's approval, but I don't, I think it would be fine if we added for good cause as part of that language is that in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2921.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For cause it just says for cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2925.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that is the understanding of that is not a differing opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2931.205s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know that the way the federal government is operating right now is not really standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2939.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: practice in governments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2940.926s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's another thing that in my mind, I'm kind of like, we're not really, we're trying to be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2946.73s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're trying to do good governance when we're writing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2949.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm thinking about like how, how we would interpret this in the future, how somebody else would interpret it in the future, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2958.097s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe we could add the word good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2961.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that, Justin, what are Councilors saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2963.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that like a thing that you would, is that standard legal language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2972.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2972.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2972.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3005.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that we, yeah, I don't think we can, I think we should allow it in here for the mayor's appointments the same way it applies to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3017.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: City Hall employees, I think it would apply to those appointees to the commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3024.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The same way that the City Council appointees would apply that the City Council would, by a majority vote, probably have permissible authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3959.145s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3960.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3960.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I mean, I would assume it is a clear distinction to say the Medford Human Rights Commission has written this letter in support of a bill that's being proposed at the statehouse or at the federal level that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3978.512s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is a bill in support of human rights in some way or, or is against a bill or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3984.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's absolutely fine for them to write that to sign it, the Medford Human Rights Commission, it has no implication beyond that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3993.46s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that is one of the purposes of the Medford Human Rights Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=3998.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that what it should read as the MHRC shall be empowered to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve social equity, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4009.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Advocacy should address, I mean, I think you can cut that whole section because they, I mean, the other thing is they, I don't think you even, well, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4020.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Genuinely, I'm not sure that you need to say in this document one way or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4031.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: what the express allowances and limitations are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4038.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But my understanding of a body like this is that you can write a letter in support, just like any individual in a city can write a letter in support of a bill or proposal at a state or federal level in the country you live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4054.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And also that you can advocate for things to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4061.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: know, there's a lot of work that needs to be done in your city as well, and that the commission has a little bit more authority to do that because they are a specialized group of people with a certain knowledge base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4071.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um so I'm not sure we need to limit their, um Authority there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4078.526s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would agree with Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4182.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I had one note about the... Are we on the... We're on the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4188.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4189.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Beautiful newsletter, Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4194.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4196.191s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You only mentioned the gender-affirming care portion of the gender-affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4202.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Don't deep sigh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4204.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nobody needs a deep sigh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4209.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4211.304s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was my only note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4212.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Otherwise, so beautiful and perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4723.895s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I would motion to keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4727.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Keep it in committee for now and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4734.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to kind of percolate on it a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4736.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel if we could not close the survey if possible just because there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4743.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There will continue to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4752.712s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does that defeat the purpose of the survey to keep it open now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4798.811s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One other question I had is, was it shared on Facebook groups?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4817.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, there may be an opportunity to get some different feedback if we went that route or asked, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4825.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Some of our state delegation if they would be willing to share it with their mailing lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4830.511s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Also, um, just some thoughts that occurred to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4835.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We may have a different More broad range of folks that would be interested in replying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4842.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4843.986s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that would, I think that would be worth looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4849.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just as I was reviewing it, especially the household income brackets were pretty high on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4856.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be interested in seeing if we could capture some of the more folks if we can, before we kind of like, you know, feel like we're really grasping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=4872.972s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: our full range of constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1881.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you very much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1882.825s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to highlight the fact that your department is, I mean, nominally the health department, but it encompasses so many different areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1894.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You cover permitting for restaurants, things like dumpsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1901.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've worked with you on rodents, overgrowth ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1907.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: gender affirming care and reproductive health care, things like food insecurity, things like services for people who are unhoused or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1922.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: have substance use disorder, there are so many things that your department does that I think it could be like four or five departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1931.01s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just really appreciate all of the work that your department does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1935.534s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I was I was wondering if you could tell us how many employees, how many full time and how many part time employees you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1987.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they're part-time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=1991.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It really often, I mean, the impression I get is that it's pulled together from a lot of different sources and that in other cities of similar size, it will often, I feel like I've worked in other cities where, or I've interacted with other cities where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2011.846s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: their issues are similar to ours, but they have departments that are many times larger, many more opportunities for people to access things like maybe an office of housing security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2021.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if somebody is going through a struggle to stay in their housing, they would have access to somebody who would be able to, you know, like maybe seven or eight people who would be able to help with like the intricacies of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2037.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2038.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It seems like a lot to put on the back of somebody in one health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2044.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just really appreciate all you and your department do and how much work it must be to manage all of this and really appreciate your presentation and it's a difficult time, generally, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2061.993s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just appreciate you laying it all out for us and all the work you've been doing and growing the community liaison program as well, which is very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2071.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2072.617s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5969.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5971.578s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Has the new solicitor, city solicitor started?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5976.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5979.203s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I worked for the superintendent when we had the former city solicitor and he would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5988.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I remember he would periodically come to school committee meetings, so, or frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5995.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I am curious about how, because I was, you know, I was taking the minutes, but I wasn't an active, you know, elected at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6005.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What will be, first of all, when can we, just in the same vein as meeting other department heads, when can we start,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6017.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: introducing ourselves, or should we shift our behaviors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6025.04s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or will it be a little bit more of a fluid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6027.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, this is a lot of questions all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6031.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: An easier<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6035.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the process of us reaching out and getting legal opinions on things that we're working on, or things that we're curious about, or any of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6048.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very excited about the prospect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6049.845s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really a great thing for the whole city, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=6054.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm glad to be moving forward in this direction, just excited to hear more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=1053.337s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, no questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=1054.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Very reasonable increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=1055.819s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here, and I appreciate your rundown of your department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2840.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, thank you for the presentation, I was wondering when you do the veterans coffee hour if it would be beneficial ever some of our members as part of our resident services and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2854.521s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: sort of we do like Community outreach listening sessions sometimes so if it would be helpful for one of our Members to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2864.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: coffee hours and maybe just hear what veterans have as concerns in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2870.727s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that might be a good opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2873.551s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, just just hear from our residents in a new environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2878.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd be happy to talk about that possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2882.056s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2892.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2892.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What time is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2894.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so maybe that would be something that we can discuss in Resident Services Committee meeting in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2901.71s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know that we need to make a motion about it, but we could just Do I need to make a motion about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2906.835s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Council Lazzaro, I motion to, uh, It's a motion now, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2931.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think many of us would love to have an opportunity to talk to folks and, you know, figure out where where people are at and what their needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2939.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, I'd love for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2941.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1549.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1551.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1552.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you tell me where the million dollar deficit is from just for our understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1610.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just for anybody watching or whatever, just a budget the size of a million dollars kind of adds up quickly, and it seems like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1623.317s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a significant amount that we are behind, but it's not necessarily because of one crazy line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1630.985s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just many numbers coming together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=1635.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and forming that deficit number for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4079.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4080.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4081.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is pretty much flat funded as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4084.791s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I wish we had more with the we could give you and improve your offerings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4088.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I mean, you do a lot with what you have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4090.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4091.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know you're you're really like overachieving with what you're given even now would be great for you to have more, hopefully someday soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=4106.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I appreciate your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=706.405s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=706.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I cut Councilor Tseng in line, but we'll get to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=711.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also echo Councilor Callahan's thoughts about being a parent in Medford and really appreciating the programming that came out of the Medford Family Network and thanks so much to Marie Cassidy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=725.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She's always an incredibly bubbly presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=727.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She gets dressed up at the events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=729.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She is like always there, always has a huge smile on her face, always fills her tiny car up with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=736.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: boxes and boxes of crafts and, you know, things for the Valentine's Day thing about the like the park things and the teddy bear picnic and everything that you can possibly attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=750.236s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But not only that, there's also things like during the pandemic when I there would be a call to help bring bags of groceries to somebody's house or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=760.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: donations somewhere that somebody needed help and the Medford Family Network was an intrinsic part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=766.568s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Marie's dedication to that organization and making sure it was still an active part of the community during the pandemic was really critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=775.716s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And she didn't let anybody forget about the young families in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=781.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Medford Family Network also has a lot of outreach for, you know, new parents, new to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=789.652s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to town but also to the country who are just like getting their sea legs under them and figuring out how to be a part of our community and, you know, how to be a parent in a new place is a really hard thing to figure out how to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=806.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate all that she's given to our community and what a welcoming place she's made Medford feel for so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=813.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, so much gratitude to Marie and best of luck in her next endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1175.449s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I found them in order and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1928.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1929.248s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate how much information is in the packet on these organizations that we're potentially helping to fund with the CDBG funds here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1940.336s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was not able to attend the Committee of the Whole, so I was reviewing the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1945.72s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something that really jumped out at me is how many of these organizations work to feed Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1953.244s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: there's a lot of income disparity in Medford, and sometimes it can be hard to recognize how many of our residents need help with this kind of thing, and these organizations are doing that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1965.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The West Medford Community Center is feeding our older residents, the Mystic Valley, YMCA, Medford Community Market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1974.732s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somebody said, I was reading the minutes, said that 40% of Medford households experience some degree of hunger,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1982.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: which I found staggering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1987.963s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Medford Council on Aging feeds our seniors every day, every weekday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1992.665s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Housing Families is helping with like legal aid, but this is, I mean, obviously Housing Families is like a homelessness prevention and mitigation organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2000.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is, these are organizations that are helping our most vulnerable residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2006.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm really grateful for the work that's being done and appreciative for all of these groups coming out and helping our residents so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2014.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there's so much that we still need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2017.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and I'm also grateful for the federal department that funds CDBG and it's safe right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2027.943s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2028.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And hopefully it continues to be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2032.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I appreciate Laurel for coming out and doing this for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2036.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2238.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2241.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2243.0s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I would just like to say that it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2245.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was pleasantly surprised to see the ADA improvements being made to the West Medford commuter rail station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2256.197s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I knew that it was happening because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2260.162s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a friend of a friend who I took a basket weaving class with happened to mention to me that she did ADA improvements with the MBTA and they were going to be doing West Medford and I was like oh that's so weird because I'm a city councilor and I don't know anything about that and that's an insane way to learn about a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2281.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there probably should have been some kind of mechanism where anybody in the city of Medford would have been notified about something like that, especially the people that live directly across the street who may have some kind of impact on their day-to-day lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2299.448s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That station doesn't have any kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2302.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2303.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's no trees in between the station and the people that live on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2307.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's a lot of houses, multi-family, single-family, right on that street that the train station is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2318.182s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2321.185s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The least we can ask is that they turn off the announcements in the middle of the night, the lights be turned down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2327.067s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The safety measures are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2330.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think, you know, people who are in the neighborhood should be able to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2334.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think other departments have done a lot of MassDOT is doing a lot of outreach about like changing one of the intersections in Medford and doing you know 25%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2345.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: planning meeting before they even think about the possibility of changing the roadway and the fact that this just happened is very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2354.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think this sort of thing would happen in a town like Wellesley, or even in a town like Arlington necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2361.772s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This sort of frustration, as President Bears mentioned, does happen a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2368.118s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just got an email that MassDOT decided not to lower the speed limit per our request on most of the roadways that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2378.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have to send it around to the council still, but decided not to lower the speed limit to 25 on most of the roadways that they control in Medford for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2387.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So even when we do try to do something to protect our residents from literal death, sometimes they just won't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2395.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we do have a lot of work to do to increase our communication with the state agencies that control the transportation mechanisms in our town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2406.493s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2408.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we have a right to request things that make the lives of our residents better and healthier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2415.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And having comfortable, adequate sleep is a pillar of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2420.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I look forward to submitting this to the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2427.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if we could even make I mean, make it even more powerful, I would be in favor of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2432.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this is this is also good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2434.185s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3362.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3362.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to offer a slightly less doom and gloom perspective, if that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3372.942s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think we can fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3375.724s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This feels very fixable to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3378.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It feels like a switch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3381.304s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: genuinely, like, I don't think the MBTA has genuinely like any reason to make this continue happening at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3391.588s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if it's a matter of like, I feel passionately about turning it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3398.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the majority of the council does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3402.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can achieve this, I feel strongly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3405.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it'll be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3407.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3409.003s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for bringing it to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3410.344s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it doesn't happen soon enough, please email us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3414.386s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We got you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6900.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6901.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6903.691s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was wondering if there will be any kind of notification mechanism for homeowners whose situation may have shifted or if they will have to look at the maps themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6913.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I looked at the map today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6956.193s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That would be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6957.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just because what could happen is that people could save money on their insurance or may need to, maybe, or may need to buy more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6967.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6969.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6973.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8692.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8693.003s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks for coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8697.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As everybody mentioned, we were working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8700.189s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I wanted to say is that I've received a few communications from residents very similar to yourself, who have been saying, you know, like, I wish we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8715.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: do more together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8716.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wish there were more people who would wanna work with me on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8720.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And these are just sort of lay people or people that I know in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8723.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And every person I say the same thing to, I'm like, there are other people like you, you guys should talk to each other and you can organize together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8731.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would love to get your contact information after this because I can try to put something together with people that are corresponding with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8739.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And to echo what everybody says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8745.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are very aware we have limited resources, but the mayor's office has more that could potentially be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8753.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But also the strategy here that is working is trying to get people to be afraid and then do nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8763.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And some of the departments in the city are taking that and going in that direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8769.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8770.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: our body is not going in that direction, which is still doesn't mean it's not very scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8779.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just means that we're resisting that impulse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8784.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would also say that it seems like the communities that are resisting the administration's push to inaction,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8797.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: are getting to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8799.513s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There were some executive orders that came out today where the president would like to crack down on sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8808.396s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's because it's really bothering him that there are sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8812.358s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that means that it means that that level of resistance, local resistance is effective and that it means you keep doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8820.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You don't stop doing something because it's having an effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8825.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You don't pull back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8827.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: when the thing that you're doing is achieving your goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8833.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You keep resisting, you continue to show up, you continue to say no, you continue to protect people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8839.172s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our job on city council, and I say this in a lot of different, about a lot of different issues, is to protect our residents first and foremost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8847.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's very clear to me that if there is somebody who's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8855.312s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: coming to try to do something that is the opposite of protecting our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8858.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our role is to continue to protect them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8862.154s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So however we can do that, we're gonna continue to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8864.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for voicing your opinion and coming to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8870.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I can grab your email, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8872.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=430.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Number five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=432.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=433.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was only gonna say that a lot of it is gray, but then you clarified that for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=439.674s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=440.614s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the chart is great to include and some clarifying explanation below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=446.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1050.256s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you send a link to is this a live form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1054.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this is a live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1055.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you send a link to Councilor Callahan and myself, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1064.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: so that we can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1065.375s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I couldn't see the bottom half of the screen because of the closed captioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1072.057s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I didn't see that Lawrence Estates is on there, and I was going to say that you should add it, but it was on there already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1076.759s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1077.439s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1639.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Still a few years out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1642.126s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would say maybe we can update that to include our newsletter because that's something we can say, like reading the city council's newsletter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1653.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: attending a listening session at the senior center that happens monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1657.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do have like new things that people can do, or attending a listening session at the library about the budget, we could hold those, we could give updates in a forum like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1673.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: maybe we could offer something like that could be something that we do more regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1691.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You have to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1804.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a question for Councilor Tseng and Councilor and Chair Leming, is the goal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1812.303s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is the goal here to take the temperature of who, which residents or how many residents are interested enough in the budget process to see like how much outreach we would need to be doing to appropriately match that interest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1828.995s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it to satisfy the budget asks of our residents for this budget this year and just immediately do that work for them based on a survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1912.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that it's, I think coming at it from both angles is definitely something we should keep doing because you're totally right that the people that are going to be already weighing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1927.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: on the things that they want to see more of are the people that are the most engaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1931.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But before I was on the city council, I only knew about what I knew about and I the like, I really needed to learn more about the current conditions of the city's budget before I would have been able to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1948.263s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think listening sessions and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1954.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Zoom meetings or any of that stuff could be really beneficial for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1960.418s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do think that those are nice ways to help people get engaged if they're interested in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2035.46s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2037.02s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2040.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think what I would want to do is rephrase what is the easiest way for you to participate in the budget process like that whole question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2047.471s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe to say, maybe to say instead, which of the following methods of participating in the budget process appeal to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2069.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: check all that apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2070.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does that sound good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2072.564s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And you could say attending city meetings, calling elected officials, emailing elected officials, you could keep those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2078.207s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But then you could also say, attending a listening session with a city councilor, reading a monthly newsletter, attending a special zoom meeting about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2102.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Which would you be most likely to participate in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2108.384s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So they would have to choose one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2120.75s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then you could keep other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2122.051s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You could keep the if none of these apply, please feel free to tell us how we'll<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2125.43s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how we can make it easier for you to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2127.811s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That could stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2142.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Let me email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2461.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2465.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2475.37s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He doesn't have to we can just say, Oh, we're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2483.376s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1474.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if this is the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1476.196s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have a comment on Councilor Leming's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1481.898s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a separate motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1483.218s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1487.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is about the mayor on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1492.189s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a few things I want to say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1496.712s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I very much understand why Vice President Collins suggested that we remove the mayor from the school committee, a plurality of people who responded to the CSC survey suggested that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1514.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: would prefer the mayor not be on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1517.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was something like 45% of the people surveyed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1519.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It wasn't a scientific survey, but it was something that we were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1523.984s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The CSC based a lot of the suggestions that they offered on that survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1529.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was a good thing to start on, but they did not use that answer for their recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1539.367s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sometimes it seemed like things were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1542.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the recommendations were cherry picked based on what was the preference of various members because of their expertise, because of their background, because of reasons complicating why we all choose to believe the things that we believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1558.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Members of our current school committee have expressed to me reasons why they think that the mayor should not be a member of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1566.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And members of our school committee have expressed to me that they would like the school committee to reflect the city council's composition, which have been roundly ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1579.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A lot of the things that our school committee members have expressed as preferences have been roundly ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1587.552s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I find that really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1589.753s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that our school committee deserves<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1595.487s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a lot more attention when we are having these conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1603.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: However, we are, unfortunately, reaching a point where we have lost time and we've lost the opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1621.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she, her, hers, we make drastic changes to this draft and I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1628.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because of the way the timing is working out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1635.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am going to make the motion to put the mayor back on the school committee in this draft that we are offering to the mayor, so that we can offer a draft that she will feel comfortable sending to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1649.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we can have something that is closer to a document that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1656.533s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: feel will move ahead, and then get passed to the voters, and is a compromise, a true compromise document where almost nobody is completely satisfied with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1670.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's how these things go, oftentimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1672.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that what we are frequently losing sight of is that we have agreed on 95% of what is in this document and that that is a real triumph for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1684.915s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, when we are down to the last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1688.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: few details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1690.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's when it seems like we're not agreeing but we've actually gotten very very far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1695.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a really really hefty document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1697.204s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's taken a really long time to get here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1698.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's 40 pages and it's like it's almost entirely things that we're happy with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1705.769s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think on this one detail, it's not a detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1710.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a big part of the way the city operates but it's something a lot of us don't agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1716.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I however think that since we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1718.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: gotten this far, I would motion to put, to strike the change Vice President Collins made last week to remove the mayor from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1731.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can't remember the exact line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1735.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can somebody help me with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1737.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3935.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3937.357s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3939.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's, I mean, I agree with what everybody has said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3946.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I did just want to say that I also wanted to offer a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3950.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I drafted a press release after we take a vote to send out that I emailed to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3962.071s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: if Clerk Hurtubises can send it to councilors, would that be best President Bears to send the draft to councilors to review or should we read it out loud?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3983.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3985.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would motion to, is there a motion to, my motion is already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5868.67s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5869.971s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to release a press release we don't often have the opportunity to share with the public a cohesive version of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5883.772s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: actions here, short of the monthly newsletter that's released as part of our, there's like four members who are not listening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5895.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five members maybe, while I'm talking right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5945.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so we don't often have opportunities to release a cohesive version of events for large votes that we take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5956.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, I would like to offer an opportunity for us to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5961.879s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: With the exception of our newsletter that we put out once a month from the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5967.545s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would like to offer a press release that we can vote on to have the city clerk send electronically<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5979.941s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and uh i think we should personally if this is a press release yes i think we should ask to be posted the way any other press released via the um communications director the mayor's office would that be possible is that are we do we have access to that well i think we're we're a city body asking for a press release so have it distributed the way they all are um so i emailed it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6003.408s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The clerk, if that is something that we can circulate it to the council, but I can read it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6011.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If that's sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6015.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it says for immediate release, April 16, 2025, this would be for tomorrow with President Bair's contact, Medford City Council submit second amended charter to mayor for submission to the state legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6027.558s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The city council voted if once we were to take the vote, we would adjust this based on how the vote goes to approve the amended charter, which would go before voters in November, 2025, if approved by the mayor and the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6044.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she, her, hers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6052.503s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: quote, with Tuesday's vote, the Medford City Council has once again fulfilled its role in the charter review process by approving a new city charter for consideration by Medford voters, this vote followed three months of deliberation by the city council on a new version of the city's core governing document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6068.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: During these meetings Councilors considered the research and evidence presented by each Councilor the final report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6074.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of the Charter Study Committee, edits made by the mayor in January and April, information and comments made by staff from the Edward J. Collins, Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6082.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Center for Public Management at UMass Boston, and comments and ideas from Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6087.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This charter review process began in 2022, following an insufficient number of signatures being collected to initiate a home rule charter process and an insufficient 4-3 vote by the Medford City Council to request state legislative approval for an appointed Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6103.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In 2022, the Mayor appointed a Charter Study Committee, CSC, charged with developing a draft charter for the Mayor to submit to the City Council for consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6113.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Over the next two years, the CSC collected public feedback and met with the Collins Center, resulting in a final report and a draft charter submitted to the Mayor in December 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6123.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The city council began considerations, when the mayor submitted her edited version of the CSC draft charter in January 2025 with a short timeline to approve a draft by early April, to ensure it was approved by the legislature in time for the November 2025 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6138.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Council President Bears and Councilor Tseng, chair of the council's governance committee, had requested earlier meetings to begin council consideration of the CSC's proposals, but accepted a request by the mayor's office to wait until the CSC had submitted its final report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6153.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Over several meetings, the city council made amendments to the mayor's draft and approved an amended city charter to submit to the mayor on March 11, 2025 by a six to zero vote, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6165.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The mayor returned this draft to the council on April 1 2025 with further amendments, which the city council considered on April 8 2025 and discussed further amended and approved imagining again that'll be subject to change at its April 15 2025 special meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6182.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Per the standard practices of the Medford House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate, as well as advised from the Collins Center, the legislature is much more likely to approve Home Rule petitions like the Special Act Charter when the local legislative body approves them by a unanimous or near unanimous vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6199.243s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Both of the council's votes on amended city charter drafts fulfilled this condition, assuming obviously, with a six to zero vote, one absent for the March 11, 2025 version and a X to X vote for the April 15, 2025 version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6213.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The council encourages the mayor to submit either approved version for the new city charter to the legislature for its approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6220.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So voters can adopt or reject a new city charter at the ballot box in November 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6224.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The city council strongly believes that voters will adopt a new charter and that either of the documents the council has submitted to the mayor would serve as a strong governing document for the future of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6294.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, there are a number of sections that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6301.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: are highlighted that are subject to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6304.154s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the motion would be to approve and the highlighted sections will be changed after the final vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6341.392s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6435.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So my thinking here is that since this is representative of the whole council, I am hesitant to put, I mean, I think that we could put something in that says, in the spirit of compromise, differing opinions, like something that indicates that we, this is why it's hard to, and I've received, as councilors have all mentioned, we've received messages from the public talking about how like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6467.334s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, you guys should communicate something to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6469.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Tell us where you're at with the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6471.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Explain to us why, you know, and we can't, because we're seven individual people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6477.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't speak with one voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6479.123s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can't really, you know, this doesn't have, it doesn't have like a, you know, we all have different thoughts and opinions and feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6495.332s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: on like so many different things in this charter that I feel like if we are to put out a press release that says anything about an opinion, it's gonna be not really representative of everybody on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6510.303s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's my hesitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6511.825s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we could say over several meetings, compromises were reached with degrees of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6523.882s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6525.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think you have to kind of not say that like, you can say that councilors expressed a variety of different opinions, but like, it's kind of, it almost at that point feels unnecessary to me till then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=6537.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, right, cause it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1288.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1289.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just have a quick note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1292.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all for taking this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1296.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you mention, please, where the train station is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1301.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really strangely situated really close to a residential area and yeah, right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1310.371s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just curious about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1313.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like a newly built station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1315.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1319.501s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Also, I think it's really interesting to note that on Canal Street, there are no businesses allowed right now with the current zoning and there are businesses there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1331.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is just something that we keep seeing with our current zoning that the way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1340.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The way that our zoning is currently written just doesn't allow for the way that our city is built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1345.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for taking it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1348.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks for the work you've been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1350.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, and if you could just talk a little bit about how we can modernize so that maybe the train station is more integrated into the neighborhood somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1359.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1556.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1558.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, the station has always been there, but it didn't even have a platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1566.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was just cement on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1569.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Now it's raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1570.934s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've recently had some outreach from the neighbors because there wasn't a lot of communication from the MBTA when it was built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1579.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is something that I think we need to work on with the MBTA, with everybody who has put the platform there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1586.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're very bright lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1587.288s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's a lot of loud announcements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1589.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's no wall in between the platform and where people's houses are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1595.954s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's right across the street, and there's nothing that blocks it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1599.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reason I bring it up is because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1602.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can see it's urban residential too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1606.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a ton of single family houses over there and some, you know, I think some three families, some two families, but it's right across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1614.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's a train station now that's been modernized and is what it probably should have been before, but it's just, it's making announcements and it has bright lights for safety, but also that ends up being like your side yard is now like a bustling,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1632.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: transit station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1633.978s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that something that we can consider as part of this discussion is like how to maybe just update the area when we integrate these conversations we can maybe as Councilors start thinking about how we talk to our state agencies about like bringing in our our neighbors and making sure that you know those communications are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1656.784s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's what I meant by saying that I mean it was like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1661.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's always been a transition it just recently became an accessible one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1666.14s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1480.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1481.703s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: At this meeting, those two papers are joined into one ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1485.825s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And tonight we will be discussing the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance, which was voted out of that committee to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3977.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3978.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to also extend my gratitude to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Morell, President Bears, and the city's legal team, KP Law, for helping us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3995.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: review the ordinance and align it with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3999.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this draft, I think, is the strongest we can make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4003.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we're really in a position to protect our residents to the best of our ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4009.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm proud of how far we've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4012.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4362.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4364.651s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I found myself very upset when I saw the video of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4370.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk being taken by ICE officers from her home in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4376.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very familiar with where she lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4379.617s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A close friend of mine lives on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4383.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I've been there many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4385.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a safe neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4386.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It makes me feel, it made me feel very afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4390.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And as a local elected official, I felt that there wasn't much that I could do except for craft a resolution stating publicly the things that I felt were most egregious about what happened, which were that the Constitution was violated and the rule of law was ignored by our federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4417.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to point that out, I wanted to do it here, and I wanted to make sure that we had a forum where our residents can understand that their city government feels strongly that that's not okay, it's not what we believe in, and we do not think that this is something that we can let continue to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4439.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in any capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4444.322s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is what we have access to as city councillors, this is what we're able, this is our forum to be able to say something, so I thought it was appropriate to say something here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4453.805s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did reach out to Tufts University, our contact at Tufts as city councillors is Rocco DiRico, he is the Government Affairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4465.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: connector, person, he is a great person to speak with in times like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4471.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he did give me a couple of statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4474.014s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He sent me an email, I'd like to read just about what they, I mean, we spoke on the phone, he sent me a statement, and then he also updated me with the Tufts president's statement that also, it was posted online, so some people may have seen it, but I would also like to read that here because I feel that it does respond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4494.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is kind of the response that I call for in the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4498.807s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I feel that even beyond what I'm going to read, I think that Tufts has been really active in responding to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4508.056s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They've done things that you can't really talk about publicly because they've really tried to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4515.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: do everything in their power to have Remesa released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4519.244s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the administration at the federal level really doesn't always listen, even though people in power are really doing what they can to try to access humanity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4535.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: anybody's humanity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4537.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Rocco's response to me was the university recognizes how frightening the situation is for her, her family and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4554.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa has provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4562.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university is actively working to support the Tufts community as it mobilizes its collective resources and contacts to ensure our students' safety and well-being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4571.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university has sent emails to all our students, faculty, and staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4575.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to outline our protocol for engaging with government officials, recommendations for documentation, and support resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4582.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We encourage our students, faculty, and staff to contact the International Center for additional support and resources."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4588.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then he added in a later email, we're also working with Rameses' attorneys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4593.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there was also, I will also read,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4599.942s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Declaration of Tufts University from President Sunil Kumar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4607.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Tufts University, an entity legally known as the Trustees of Tufts College and henceforth referred to as Tufts University, the university or Tufts declares as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4617.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One, on Tuesday, March 25, 2025, the university learned that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral student from Turkey, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4630.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university understands that she was leaving her home that evening for an iftar dinner hosted at the Tufts Interfaith Center, where she would break her Ramadan fast for the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4639.554s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Two, at around 6.30pm that evening, the Tufts University Police Department received courtesy notification from the Somerville Police Department that an individual had been detained by federal authorities and that the person in custody might be a Tufts student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4652.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We confirmed through our records that the person in question was Ramesa Ozturk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4656.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Three, at 7.32 p.m., Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4658.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk's record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, was updated to note that her visa was terminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4667.489s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Prior to that, and at the time of her detention, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4669.47s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk was in, quote, good immigration standing, according to her record in SEVIS, and both Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4674.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk and Tufts had followed the governing regulations for students on visas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4681.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university then received a notice dated March 25, 2025,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4685.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and received via email on March 26, 2025, at 10.31 a.m., stating that Rameza's visa was canceled because she was a non-immigrant status violator, citing 237A1CI of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and or that the United States believes that her presence in the country would result in, quote, potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4710.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: With her consent, the university can confirm that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4712.703s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk is a third-year doctoral student in good academic and administrative standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4716.724s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Her research focuses on how young adults can use social media in positive, pro-social ways, and she is described by her faculty as a hard-working student dedicated to her studies,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4726.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and the Tufts community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4728.29s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4734.595s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university has seen an outpouring of support from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4736.997s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4740.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These individuals have described Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4742.081s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits, and committed to her colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4748.346s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five, the university can confirm that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4750.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ozturk was one of several authors of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, the Tufts Daily, published on March 26, 2024, entitled, Try Again, President Kumar, Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate Resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4764.193s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university declares that this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4769.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Further, no complaints were filed with the university or to our knowledge outside of the university about this op-ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4775.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university maintains that the op-ed was consistent with speech permitted by the Declaration on Freedom of Expression adopted by our trustees on November 7, 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4784.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For the record, a search on the Tufts Daily will reveal op-eds on multiple sides of the issue with opinions that were shared just as strongly as the op-ed Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4791.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oster co-authored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4792.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the university's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4802.116s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Six, our international students, faculty, and staff are vital to deliver on the education, teaching, research, and public service mission of Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4809.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: University sponsors 1,818 continuing international students on F-1 visas alongside 569 alumni who are pursuing post-completion work authorization in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4822.585s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 24 degree and non-degree students on J-1 visas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4825.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is in addition to the broader community of students, faculty, and staff that hold various immigrant and non-immigrant statuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4831.474s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seven, the free movement of our international community members is therefore essential to the functioning of the university and serving our mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4837.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university has heard from students, faculty and staff who are foregoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4846.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4852.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university declares that many of these students will go on to make significant economic and intellectual contributions to the United States and in countries around the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4860.736s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They will do so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4861.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: by working in or building new companies through teaching and research and universities and other academic and healthcare institutions and through public service in the United States and across the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4870.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The university is confident in its exploration because thousands of Tufts University alumni have received their education while on F-1 visas and have gone on to make a positive impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4879.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to the economic prosperity and intellectual success of the United States and in other countries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4884.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The undersigned submits this declaration on behalf of Tufts University in support of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4887.956s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Azterk and asks that she receive the due process rights to which she is entitled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4892.46s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Based on everything we know and have shared here, the university seeks relief so that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4895.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Azterk is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree at Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.075s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then it is signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.895s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On behalf of the university, I understand declares under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on April 1 2025 at Tufts University Sunil Kumar president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4915.979s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I, I'm sorry that was so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4919.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just felt that it was important to articulate everything that was shared with me from Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4926.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The important thing I think is that Tufts did give like a very, very thorough response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4933.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just feel very strongly that we declare that the Constitution was not followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4947.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We still, Ramesa is still in Louisiana, and it's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4953.821s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4955.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5494.362s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a quick correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5496.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Constitution protects freedom of speech for everybody in America, regardless of immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6809.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A B paper would be my preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7381.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7381.461s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to thank Councilor Tseng and Vice President Collins for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7387.166s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very actionable, simple, and concrete way to help our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7394.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Very straightforward and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7396.273s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8553.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8554.762s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate, again, all the work that's gone into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8559.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Obviously, we've gone through the charter with the fine-tooth comb and the governance committee and committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8569.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We sent our version to the mayor and the mayor made her edits and I have a couple of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8579.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What I think are fairly small amendments I'd like to make to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8585.798s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Version of the charter, and then I would be comfortable voting in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8590.879s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Those amendments are in section 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8593.38s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 3 subsection a. I would like to add back in the words or ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8603.256s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: where in the red line version they were removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8606.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is where the city council is able to add, um, is able to appoint members to, um, multiple member committees or commissions, um, by charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8620.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says right now, um, only by charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8623.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, I, it used to say or ordinance and that applies to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8630.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that has active applications now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8633.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this version of the charter would remove the city council's ability to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8640.363s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would like to add that back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8644.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's one change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8645.346s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And second change is in section 2.1 subsection C, the second sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8653.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like it to say award Councilor shall be a voter in the word from which election is sought, period, and I would like to strike the remainder of that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8665.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The rest of the sentence says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8668.286s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They have to have resided in that word for a year, but there is no mention of having to reside in any word or district or city for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8680.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For any other elected office anywhere else in the charter, including school committee at large, including an at large city Councilor, including the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8691.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Including school committee district, so I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8696.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I spoke to the mayor about both of these today and she said it was fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8702.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would like to make these amendments and motion to, I don't know if that would have to be a separate motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8713.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to approve, but I guess those two, I would motion for those two amendments first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11733.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like us to vote on each of those amendments, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12345.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I also have my hand up just to let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12556.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that I, I hope that the meeting next week can be on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12566.869s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12567.31s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12799.935s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16878.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16880.44s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming really covered it pretty well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16883.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is something that the Chamber of Commerce is in favor of and supportive of and something we've talked about at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16890.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it would be a great benefit to the city to have just baseline ways for us to make sure that our storefronts are being well maintained and keeping our business districts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16911.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: vibrant and looking as lovely as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16915.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If something is vacant for a period of time, that it can be beautified by public art, which is supportive of our local artists as well, so win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16928.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this probably would have been in the section of the agenda that would refer to committee, so it's not really meant for us to be going carefully through the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16939.58s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: at this time, so we would have a lot more work to do on it still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16955.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Good to know for next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16957.729s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20214.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That are present bears can I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20221.856s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, I just want to reiterate that the cost of the study is much less than what would be, what the parcels would be sold for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20231.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The parcels are only not buildable because there's an imaginary line drawn between the two of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20238.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Portable housing could be built on this land and I don't believe that there is a need to sell them at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20244.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is why I will be voting no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20311.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also want to reiterate that, or maybe say for the first time, that sometimes things are communicated to boards and commissions as the best way to do something, but they may not have the full story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20324.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just think that disagreeing with something as presented doesn't necessarily mean we don't support the work that's happening by the boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20335.569s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=615.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=617.384s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=617.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm checking my audio because I am on a different Zoom today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=623.03s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4120.235s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4123.116s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4125.214s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4125.854s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we know how many City Hall employees are at City Hall on average during City Hall hours and how many parking spaces?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4136.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does it correspond accurately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4138.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it the right amount of spaces?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4173.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And is it OK if I keep going, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4176.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4179.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the hours are 8.30 to 4.30 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, 8.30 to 7.30 on Wednesday, and then 8.30 to 12.30 on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4194.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think, so it would just be those hours only city hall employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4201.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then the other hours, it would be open parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4205.307s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The thing that I'm thinking about is there's another complicating factor, which is that often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4210.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: businesses like the Chevalier uses the City Hall lot as their sort of like suggested municipal parking for people going to shows at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4222.983s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is kind of a nice thing to have a municipal lot that doesn't really get policed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4236.052s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's also sort of unheard of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4239.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To have a lot that's free that nobody pays money to park at so I understand why we wouldn't necessarily, you know, need to maintain that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4249.203s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4254.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4255.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm feeling some hesitation in myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4259.461s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I guess I would be curious if we had the number of employees who are in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4266.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel like Nina would know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4268.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4268.808s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not off the top of your head, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4384.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4385.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4385.98s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4387.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4724.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1415.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1416.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1417.748s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: First thing he said is to make sure we link the city council's budget requests and individual Councilor requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1426.098s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think my editorializing on that is probably we would want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1431.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: highlight the ones that we ended up proposing to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1437.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: His second thing is, actually, do you want to take a second to do that, or should I go through all of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1461.446s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1461.906s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'll let Councilor Tseng go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1624.173s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't hate this formatting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1627.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I found the other formatting, I mean, for consistency, I think we were all well, I'll speak for myself, I was just trying to keep it consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1639.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it was feeling redundant to have to repeat that phrasing the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1644.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also kind of like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1649.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, it was, you know, regular city council meetings and it says March 11th as like a subheading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1654.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I kind of like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1655.287s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, I, I, I don't think anybody is too, um, is, is following our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1662.593s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe this isn't true, but I'm not sure that there's anybody that's reading our newsletters with a fine tooth comb yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1668.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and, uh, we may still be early enough in the process that we can try a few different things, um, and see which feels like the most efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1679.937s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1682.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I don't hate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1869.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1869.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am wondering, last time we did this, we did update on things that had happened like that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1876.324s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We just moved the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance out of committee to the regular meeting last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1887.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we could add something about that from public health and community safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1899.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think oh, that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1901.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1902.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but yeah, but we kind of have been doing this calendar month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1952.492s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2103.654s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I'm comfortable with that if that's cool with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2261.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it nice to have the language be a little inconsistent for the flow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2269.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of it, the differences can be kind of nice to read that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2371.02s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3221.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3222.289s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that this committee is a great place to sort of orient this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3232.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we, because of our experience with the newsletter and our experience with the listening sessions that we've had as an ongoing project, I do think that this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3244.847s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this kind of a plan originating here or us taking a deliberative approach to this kind of project and taking our time with putting out something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3259.991s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Also observing what we have in the last few months with the results of some municipal surveys that we've taken in and that have resulted in real<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3274.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: concrete suggestions for ways to move the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3278.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But knowing that like maybe some of the methodologies or results, maybe there are ways that we could learn more or dig into the results a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3291.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a great opportunity for us to try to do some of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3296.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I really am eager to get started on this project and I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3303.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thankful that Councilor Tseng brought it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3306.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we're a good spot for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3308.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be happy to support this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3942.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: um so good well i'm glad somebody's interested i won't be alone yeah matt and i can sort it out okay because i think there's some arguments for beautiful fantastic thanks um i also think it sounds great but i uh it doesn't it wouldn't um i don't think i would be as good at it as um some others but i i think it sounds thumbs up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4305.604s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would help with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4310.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4310.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, guys, there was once another registry somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1013.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1014.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a meeting of the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1019.845s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1022.306s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are meeting today to discuss the public or the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1031.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1035.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a draft of the ordinance that has been worked on for quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1042.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, the draft was circulated with committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1048.241s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, this week, and it was also reviewed over the past few weeks with with our legal representation at KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1059.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Councilor Tseng and I met and discussed with our council and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1067.855s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we have a version that is not we can't circulate that where we can't present to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1073.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because it's attorney client privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1075.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The comments can't be circulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1076.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do have a clean version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1079.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But what I what I shared with the council with the committee members is the red line version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1086.279s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, to compare with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1089.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: what we have as the draft of the last version that we reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1095.142s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I wanted to say as an introduction before we get into our deliberations is just reviewing the purpose of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1107.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh, initially, it was to reaffirm that gender affirming care and reproductive health care is a right in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1117.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is true at the state level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1120.996s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but, uh, everything is very uncertain right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1128.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it is nice to have something, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1131.925s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: when you're not sure where things are going, where your community is heading to know that your local lawmakers are sort of shoring up the right to gender affirming care and reproductive health care in all its forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1148.759s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in your local laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1150.12s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's what this ordinance is aiming to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1155.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is reaffirming access to those healthcare resources, also reaffirming that healthcare providers will not be in trouble for providing those resources, also saying that Medford is a welcoming community in these ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1173.273s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: for people of any gender and anybody trying to access this type of care and provide this type of care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1181.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It also goes into a type of business called a limited services pregnancy center, which is a business that can present itself like it's a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1196.093s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something that would provide reproductive health care, but really is misrepresenting itself and doesn't really provide that kind of health care services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1209.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Correcting the record on some of that and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1217.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1218.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, and I'm just saying that people who provide health care services won't be penalized for doing so in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1227.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I was hoping that councilors can do is look at the two versions of this document, decide which of the changes we would like to adopt in our final version, and then hopefully send it to the regular city council meeting so that we can move forward with adopting the ordinance if we'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1251.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1255.257s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, I have to touch you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1256.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, that's seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1647.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1651.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would suggest if we have any motions, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1661.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins is on actually she may not be she may have just she may be coming in the building now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1670.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Council Collins was on zoom but is arriving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1674.47s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and I wanted to give her an opportunity to speak on this topic, but a couple of the changes that were recommended by our council was to explicitly align the text with our state with the state law, um, specifically in the first section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1694.884s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1697.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: which has in the second paragraph of the first section, which maybe I can put our draft ordinance on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1704.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you tell me how to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1711.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I can put it on Zoom, share my screen on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1713.405s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1753.701s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, this is our draft that we shared with our lawyers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1759.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In the second paragraph that we have here, they replaced it with, it is therefore declared to be the city of Medford's public policy for the city to comply with the provisions of state law, including quote, enact expanding protections for reproductive and gender affirming care, chapter 127 of the acts of 2022 as set forth herein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1782.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I'm curious to hear thoughts from Councilors on adopting or not adopting that as an amendment to the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1796.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Welcome, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1798.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, oh, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1799.58s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1801.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Still, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1815.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it is replacing, actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1827.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it fully replaced the second paragraph or is it pulled up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1830.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it does replace the second paragraph then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1831.995s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, the second paragraph that's up here as written is replaced by what I just read out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1884.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So would you be interested in adding that section in addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1891.057s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1904.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would you like to say that in the form of a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1916.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Personally, I think I would agree with that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1919.169s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that there is a hesitation to, oh, I'll be right with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1929.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think there's a hesitation to explicitly state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1939.953s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What it is we're trying to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1940.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What it is we're trying to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1943.555s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess, in a sense, because of where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1950.138s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's a lot of what we're grappling with in this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1956.541s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's just a decision that we all have to make, is how explicitly are we doing what we're doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1966.166s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's all I'll say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2012.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am curious what happens if the state law is changed or repealed, or then the specificity of it is changed at all, if it negates anything, or if we have to go back in and amend it because it's so specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2031.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2034.403s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, is there anything else from, well, I mean, there's a lot of, there are a lot of changes suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2040.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess another option is, do we want to, do we want to adopt the changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2054.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we want to not adopt the changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2056.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we want to take some time and go through them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2063.819s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: piece by piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2065.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2083.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, Councilor Leming is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2086.069s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, and now that Vice President Collins is here, we're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2098.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2131.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2132.71s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are we comfortable with just going over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2134.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2135.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So OK, so that that section in the in the top paragraph felt like a substantive change to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2141.972s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A lot of the a lot of the recommendations in the track changes are comments about like broad strokes, big picture things about like, are we comfortable with the level of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2157.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are we comfortable with doing this period?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2159.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, then it's you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2162.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this is aligned with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2165.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, you know, align with state law line of state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2168.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All of those things are, um, just updating us on that, which is really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2174.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um There is a comment on In the the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2186.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What is I think the third page of our printed copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2189.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That says where it says city agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2193.632s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2194.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: City agent means any employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2197.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will scroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2202.545s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: City agent means any employee of the city of Medford, whether full time or part time, regular or seasonal, any intern or volunteer when acting on behalf of the city of Medford, any contractor for the city of Medford while a contract between the city of Medford and said contractors in effect, and any recipient of city funding grants, awards or appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2221.821s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there is a suggestion that the city should carefully think about what that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2230.507s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: like how broad that is, that maybe it would include too many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2236.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think also it does occur to me that like, you know, there are organizations that we give grants and funding to like, you know, churches to fix a building or nonprofits to provide transportation to individuals that may not need to be kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2259.322s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2262.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's one thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2264.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will go to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2268.864s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2369.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, I, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2372.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the way that this prints when you print it doesn't have every change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2377.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that there were something like 141 edits made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2381.646s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I can, if I send it to you, could you email it to the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2387.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2610.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2611.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2612.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So you think that that was removed for that reason, that it's not in the state law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2631.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2662.413s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2663.193s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The clerk is sending the fully redlined version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2669.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think my impression is aligned with Councilor Tseng that the majority of the changes will be to align the language with the state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2685.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that you getting an email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2694.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So some of the changes are things like capitalizing the C in the word city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2700.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there are a lot of changes like that that I think we can adopt comfortably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2705.936s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are other changes like removing the second paragraph or condensing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2712.138s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are some things that were redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2717.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I guess there are larger shifts that we should probably look at really carefully and think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2728.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: carefully about if we would want to adopt them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2735.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did also reach out to the chief of police about a section at the end, but we can get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2743.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2766.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think it requires that we change state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2767.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, we can have something that's not perfectly in alignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2771.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would just have to make the choice to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2773.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if we're, I mean, I think if we believe solidly that it's not enough or it doesn't go far enough or whatever, or it needs greater protection for whatever reason, I don't think it precludes us, but I don't think it's not possible for us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2789.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just what was recommended to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2798.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've made it more confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2829.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2832.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2837.159s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2985.979s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think the, our goal here is to broaden the protections as much as possible and not necessarily broaden the like, punishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2999.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3001.587s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3001.727s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As long as our residents and visitors are protected, then that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3006.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Then we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3021.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: or a contractor while they're under contract with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3024.007s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That feels to me like what we mean when we say city agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3026.969s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think in the language, if we were saying something else, we would say something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3031.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We wouldn't be saying city agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3034.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think when we're talking about like a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford, we're saying city agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3041.02s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would just say that probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3050.378s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right, which I think is probably too broad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3052.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a good point made by our council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3063.147s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is not actually a change that's suggested, that's a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3066.248s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it's a comment, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3067.028s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, so that would have to be a separate motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3069.289s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we were to say, like, adopt the changes, then separate motion if we wanted to take that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3105.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the contractor while under contract with the city, I would agree with you because I think that can include a lot of people who have long term contracts with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3115.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um Yeah, I think so, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3120.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3120.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3121.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3127.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, do Councilors have any other thoughts about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3129.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, any of the other sections where I know it takes a while to look over the stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3157.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Calihan, wait, you're six, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3161.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Calihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3227.918s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: don't know about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3229.678s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My understanding was always that when we write these, we have to include, notwithstanding any state or federal law, to the contrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3239.941s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Though it is also, I think, implied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3241.941s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins can confirm that for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3248.143s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, you're nodding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3249.463s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And you're requesting, anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3251.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3376.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3377.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, that's basically what it would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3380.981s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's the interesting thing about the Constitution and the rule of law is that it always is supposed to be the thing that you follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3389.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Even if you don't say it all the time, you're supposed to follow those laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3396.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3400.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3401.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3401.474s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I would agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3406.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: there is another, there's a couple comments from council that we should review a few sections of the ordinance with the health department and the police department, which I am happy to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3422.256s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did, I have an email out to the chief and I spoke with the board of health this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3432.819s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3435.66s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And before this goes before the full council will That'll be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3441.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I might have to, you know, knock down some doors, but it'll happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3445.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and in the meantime, I mean, I feel like we can check those boxes when we come to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3454.405s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But is there anything else that You'd like to Discuss before we Move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3463.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3464.818s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: substantial adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3549.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3550.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe we can still, I mean, I believe you can still include information on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3562.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: consumer protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3563.995s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that element of it, I think is still fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3568.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's especially because the Attorney General's Office has like a database of these, like these organizations that are spreading misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3578.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, and that's allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3579.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But you can't, you can't like, shut down<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3632.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, G2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3634.147s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it's pulled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3636.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It basically, that in our original draft, I'll show you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3642.124s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says no limited services pregnancy center shall make or disseminate before the public or cause to be made or disseminated before the public, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3649.306s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They just, it said like, you can't advertise your company that you know to be reason, that you know to be, you know, spreading misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3660.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that was removed, that was suggested to be removed, but still has, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3670.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something about the Attorney General's consumer protection resources, access to consumer protection resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3680.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do wonder, in an ordinance, those consumer protection resources may be available now, but it's something that's going on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3697.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that something that can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3699.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to be updated easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3701.211s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How easily can we update?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3704.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The language of that if that were to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3708.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3715.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3998.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was to align with the state law to just say, we're not doing anything<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4006.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: unusual or different from what Massachusetts has already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4013.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think I would agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4017.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5201.75s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5204.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1516.141s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: meeting that outlined the priorities of the bike commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1520.344s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And a lot of that is covered in our budget priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5183.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just thank Councilor Teng for bringing this forward and I look forward to discussing it in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5188.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6004.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6005.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a rational ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6010.287s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6014.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have $28 million in pre-cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6020.575s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The fire station remains in a difficult state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6026.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am curious about where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6031.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not really, it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6034.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6036.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6037.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not anybody's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6038.859s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We, I don't know how we can use what's at our disposal to help the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6046.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to put a statement into the public statement into the ether that it would be nice if we could do some improvements on the fire station somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6058.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6346.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6346.905s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um Councilor Callahan said exactly what I was going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6351.406s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6352.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um it means exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6354.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes Um, no, I would not be in favor of selling these parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6358.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also know that it was these parcels were toured by, um, an affordable housing developer and architect prior to this discussion that they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6376.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: basically gives these lands as owned by the city to affordable housing developers directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6384.444s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't need to be, and then we have them, and then they're affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6388.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't need to sell them to a private person for, this doesn't, I would not support this as it is right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6396.59s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7107.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there, I may be missing it in the documentation, but is there a cost for the study that we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7114.371s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you know how much the study costs, the nexus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7146.061s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess what I'm saying is that the studies, it seems, are not very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7154.647s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I really couldn't agree more with Councilor Callahan that when you sell<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7162.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: land that's owned by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7165.442s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can't, you don't get it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7168.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We own these parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7171.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a history of selling off lands that we've owned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7177.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it's a sacrifice that we shouldn't make lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7181.65s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think there's more potential in these parcels than we're giving them credit for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7189.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just I would not be prepared to sell them for the purpose of beginning a study that we could very easily begin in other ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7458.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7460.19s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7461.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you clarify for me, undevelopable, does that mean separately as two parcels, or if they were made, because they're next to each other, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7494.236s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7494.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So as they are, as our zoning is right now, the two lots, the size that they are now, are undevelopable as the two separate lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7504.122s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But if we put them into one lot, then they are a normal size for something to be put on them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7511.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7530.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7530.978s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that's an important thing to note here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7533.019s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's that it's there's a somewhat arbitrariness to the fact that this is an undevelopable undevelopable lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7539.903s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not that you cannot build something on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7541.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's that because of the way that they're that the lines are drawn because of the way our zoning ordinances are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7548.468s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Technically, you can't put two houses on these two lots, but that does not mean that you can't physically build something on this space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7556.453s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just means that it's a wonky weird thing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7562.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: it does not mean that there is not potential for this to hold a building that could house humans in it eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7570.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7572.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1088.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Very quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1089.363s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you send us this presentation after the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1094.207s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you send this presentation to us after the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1095.828s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, yes, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1096.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2384.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, do you have an estimate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2388.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or my own education because I can't remember the new growth in prior years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2392.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is this average amount or a smaller amount or larger amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=830.983s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=831.643s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to focus on safety in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=836.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So my first request is something that a couple of other Councilors recommended, which is adopting the suggestions of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=847.807s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=848.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have a dollar amount attached to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=850.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure what it would all cost there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=852.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that they are relatively reasonable requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=856.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The only one that is a significant spend would be hiring the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=865.027s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: hiring somebody in DPW whose focus would be, or no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=869.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I think it's DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=871.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's the traffic person who would focus on traffic engineer whose focus would be on walking, biking and transit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=879.679s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that's already a position that's somebody who was hired at one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=888.447s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is an open position right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=890.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's not it's not a crazy reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=894.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think any of these are crazy reaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=896.671s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the second one is something that is was not recommended by other Councilors and is something that people may not be aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=904.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But our new fire chief let me know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=909.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, Medford doesn't have a dive team on in the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=914.343s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, surrounding towns and cities do have dive teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=917.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a good number of boat clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=920.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a lot of waterways in Medford and lacking a dive team is a sort of whole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=927.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: an opportunity in our public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=931.582s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So after we had a very notable drowning in the summer of 2019, I believe, 10 of our firefighters took it upon themselves and began the training to become certified for underwater search and rescue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=950.029s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But to have a full dive team, you need 12 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=952.631s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So he, Chief Evans did, went and got an independent estimate for what it would cost to train, fully train, finish the training of the 10 people who started the training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=966.139s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think they have two more steps to go and do a full training for two more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=969.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then the equipment that it would take, and it would cost 123, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=975.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 123 22 yeah about $123,000 so I think that's well worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=981.729s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=982.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: An excellent sort of commendation to the people that started that training and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=990.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: it would just be general, um, best practice for the city to have that kind of resource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=997.311s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, um, I just think it's a boost morale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1002.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's good for everybody in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1004.854s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3061.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a quick question about the logistics of how to submit our materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3065.534s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would you like us to email them to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3068.716s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How would you like those submitted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2056.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2058.288s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to thank you all for talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2063.051s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I've just put in a quick plug for what Councilor Leming was mentioning about West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2069.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know, sorry, I know that I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2076.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A lot of this depends on the size of the lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2079.281s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I recognize that you have to look into it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2081.243s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think that West Medford Square in particular, because of the positioning of the station there and the proximity to North Station, I think we really have to emphasize the potential for greater density of that commercial area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2101.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would just really want to prioritize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2104.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4359.603s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4360.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was wondering if somebody could potentially, if I could ask through the chair for some comments from Director Hunt about the CD board and the amount of like obligation we might be placing on them to, like if we're putting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4385.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: if we're obligating them to take on too many questions, is it prohibitive the amount of, the number of issues it may be under the purview of the city board to look at if we have special permits for a lot of these decisions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4412.76s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I'm curious about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4415.596s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: when it becomes functionally not allowed that ADUs could be put on various spaces because they need a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4425.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then what ends up happening is nobody does it because it takes four months to get on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4431.905s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It takes too long to cover the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4433.726s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It gets continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4434.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not worth trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4525.598s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4526.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The question is really more like, how many ADUs would we want to permit by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4531.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or would they go to special?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4533.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This isn't every single.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4534.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I see what the issue is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4537.564s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's not that we're not adding on restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4542.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can't add on restrictions because the state law is that ADUs are allowed on single family homes by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4551.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we can't take that away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4552.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=474.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take paper 25-043 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=640.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a great moment to begin talking about the potential for Medford Square to have some restaurants that are open a little bit later, especially when we have shows at the Chevalier and holidays where it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=655.031s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=656.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's perfectly fine and normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=659.194s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14656.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14657.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to address a couple of things that I heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14660.632s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first was a resident who spoke about not being able to walk places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14668.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when we talk about wanting to increase walkability,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14672.468s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in a certain neighborhood that that leaves out a subset of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14678.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's a really valuable and important thing to keep in mind when we have these conversations that many of our residents have disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14686.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many of our residents are older, can't or even may choose not to walk somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14692.815s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And those are those residents preferences and abilities are just as valid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14701.015s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and that is part of the fabric of our neighborhoods and our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14705.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it's really important to weigh those concerns with everything that we're talking about all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14714.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that goes hand in hand with something that I find really concerning about some of the edits that were made when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14725.073s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the medical offices were changed and it was moved from something being a standard medical office to a neighborhood medical office with only five employees and it has to be very small and it's only able to open with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14740.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: CDB approval in mixed-use 2 and the commercial region of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14748.509s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that was a direct response to the proposed medication-assisted treatment site that ended up pulling its application due to community resistance and bad PR, and they didn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14766.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: introduce themselves appropriately and the stigma against people with substance use disorder took over that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14773.669s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I find that really frustrating because I think that it is discriminatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14780.673s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that the conversation got really deeply off track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14786.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And what came out of that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14790.087s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a whole street now with almost no opportunity for doctor's offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14796.968s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's kind of crazy, including a clinic where people can go get treatment for substance use disorder, which is a disease that you cannot discriminate against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14809.691s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And now we are not allowing, we're not allowing anybody to get that treatment on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14817.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I can't really do anything about that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14821.742s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not going to propose an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14823.643s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just really disappointed because I know a lot of people who deal with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14828.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a lot of us know a lot of people that deal with that, and I think we've allowed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14835.002s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that stigma to become something that has entered into our conversation about zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14843.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14846.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that being said, I'm happy to support Councilor Leming's amendment to move back to mixed use two in the intersection in the center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14862.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of the corridor and at least then there would be the opportunity for there to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14867.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a CDB approved neighborhood medical office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14871.841s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, because as the resident who, okay, I think a couple of residents mentioned that they do need access to medical offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14879.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14881.449s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think it's a community good, and I think it would be a good thing to have at least available for somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14888.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I, I do also just want to say thank you again to everybody for all of the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14893.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It took a lot of time and energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14895.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to put all of this together, and a lot of careful thought went into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14901.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm proud of all of the work that everybody's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14905.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm proud of everybody who spoke tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14906.634s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think everybody was thoughtful and careful in their comments, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=14912.875s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16704.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is becoming clear to me that these things are going to start happening really quickly all at once now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16710.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that accurate, Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16747.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Understood, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=0.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A few more of these, I'm converting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I, um, I can't get this to cross over here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=678.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=678.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have had some updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=680.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our, um, state delegation has our so our, um, Representative Sean Garber Lee, Senator Pat Jalen and Mayor Lungo-Koehn have met with the commissioner of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=698.75s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the Department of Conservation and Recreation have talked about planned improvements to the rotary by the Mystic Lakes, where Dan Dill was originally hit by a car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=714.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They are planning to start those soon, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=718.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it is, of course, still, you know, the tragedy is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=727.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: tragedy, but it is excellent that conversations are ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=733.393s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The spring construction season is about to begin, and hopefully those improvements can take effect soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=740.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that it's an excellent opportunity to talk about all of the places where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=748.208s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, there are still opportunities for us to continue conversations, especially parts of the city where the roads are not controlled by Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=759.276s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, when things do happen on city controlled roads, it's very easy for us to make quick improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=766.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our director of traffic and transportation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=770.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Todd Blake is very responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=773.015s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do put up quick mitigation, flashing signs, bump outs, things like that can happen very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=785.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I observe them all the time I get an email, and then a couple days later there's a flashing sign, it's, it's excellent if it's a city controlled road we can do that, but on the state controlled roads, it can be more complicated and this is the first meeting of hopefully another future meeting we can talk more about traffic enforcement on some of these roads, hopefully with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=804.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Medford Police Department and the state police because, uh, these being state roads again, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=812.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That complicates things further, even with enforcement, because, um, those technically those roads are enforced by the state police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=821.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So more to come, but for now I would love to hear from the Medford Bicycle Commission because that's something that obviously cycling is a wonderful thing to do, excellent for your health, great way to get quickly across the city, but also it can be a really dangerous way to travel and it shouldn't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=844.42s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=846.261s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this is something that the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission talks about a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=852.363s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Ways to improve the infrastructure in the city so that it's as safe as possible, and it continues to be that great healthy way to travel around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=864.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great for kids, and a great way to get to and from school, work, and all the places that we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=872.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=874.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: through the chair, if we, if you would like to invite the representatives from the bicycle commission to address the council about there were, I believe some, yeah, some priorities you wanted to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1292.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for sharing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1294.028s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1295.348s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do have something in our regular meeting agenda to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1301.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: like a timeline for councillors to bring budget items to our budget meetings that are coming up this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1309.128s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So can you talk a little bit more about the budget section of the priorities and just talk, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1319.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: address maybe if you have an idea of the scope, like how much they would each cost and how we might as a council be able to offer some of those items to the mayor's administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2107.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to thank you again for your advocacy, and I want to reiterate that this issue does, um, the issue of the safety of people traveling on Medford streets outside of cars is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2125.976s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: not contentious in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2128.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's universally something that people want to prioritize, protect the people who are moving through the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2137.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2144.471s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we'll continue to do everything that we can to, as President Bears alluded to, the things that are within our power as a council to take the steps that we can take to mitigate the issues that we see, make things better and easier for people traveling on bikes and on foot and do our best to protect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2166.935s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I really appreciate you coming out and sharing the things that you've,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2171.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: identified as concrete ways that we can help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2174.178s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do think that the budget coming up is a great moment for this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=2180.264s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1337.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1338.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to say thank you, Councilor Tseng, for doing this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1341.885s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's important that we go over these kinds of issues with our commission so that we make sure that anything that's getting in the way of our commissions being able to gather is remedied when we notice it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1356.397s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1357.418s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4770.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4770.97s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just don't have a legal opinion about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4773.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm listening to what you guys are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4775.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just don't have the expertise to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4778.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted you to know that I feel neutral on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5113.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5683.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5683.675s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think one thing I would want to, I'll be doing the next one of these at the senior center at the end of March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5692.679s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And something I'm looking forward to for the next one is just focusing on when we brought this to the floor at the regular meeting, the reason it kind of came up and why we wanted to make sure it was a priority for our body was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5714.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: least in my mind, that regular city council meetings aren't really a great opportunity for people to bring their issues to the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5723.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a great time to do it is in these kind of one-on-one sessions where we have more time and space, you can bring whatever is really bothering you that you really need the attention from people in the city to something that is really critical to your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5744.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that this is what you were, what Councilor Callaghan was saying, but I would only say that like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5752.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: one nice thing about the listening sessions is that somebody can bring up whatever is pertinent to their experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5759.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if it's something that's different than like, if they're not concerned about housing, but they are concerned about parking, they could talk about parking even if we want to talk about housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5769.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess that's something that I feel like would be a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5775.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because when we're in our regular meetings, we're only supposed to be talking about what's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5780.394s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when we're in a listening session, we're there to hear whatever is on their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5784.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't have a really robust constituent services apparatus right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5790.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm in the planning office and the light keeps turning off on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5794.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I came to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5796.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5797.113s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't realize it was Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5799.074s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The point is, I think that we can build a more robust constituent services apparatus by listening to what people are bringing to us, by offering them, if we have a really concrete list of these are the city services we have access to, we can point you in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5814.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you are in need of something, you're telling us right to our face, we can tell you how to get that, and we can point you in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5822.113s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is something that I think is really nice about the listening sessions when people bring those things to the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5828.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think you are right that sometimes it can be very uncomfortable when people bring it to the floor in front of everybody that's around them and they have an axe to grind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5836.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not always the most effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5838.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the other thing I will say is that I think the more we do these things, the less it's going to be about stuff that is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5846.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something that's something everybody's talking about all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5850.13s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's only going to be about Salem Street zoning, eventually we're going to have said everything there is to say about Salem Street zoning and we'll have to move on to something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5860.321s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're still showing up for these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5863.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our committee is still showing up for the listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5866.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We will still be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5867.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am looking forward to the session on March 27th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5872.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If people want to talk about Salem Street zoning, let's talk about Salem Street zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5875.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'll tell you everything I know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5877.654s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can tell me everything you think and feel and know about it, and we'll have another conversation and I'll write down everything you say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5885.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, that's what the listening session is for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5887.941s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what the regular meeting is for, and that's the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6558.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the first part of it was going to be a study to determine which are actually lead because it was going to be less than we don't have to put all of this in the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6568.096s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would recommend we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6570.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6574.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6575.991s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A bond for the DPW to identify and repair lead sewer pipes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6584.418s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would probably leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6588.201s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But you're saying you want to tell property owners that there will be funds to help reimburse them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6597.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it a reimbursement or do they get money up front?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6621.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6621.615s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6764.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, baseline say after lengthy discussion, for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6768.613s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It feels well, it feels important to mention that that we like, you know, we debated and we discussed, you know, like, we discussed the research we talked about, like, we don't have to put all of this in, but we like it was thoroughly examined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6787.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then we voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6892.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, he's just saying they didn't meet, so he doesn't have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6915.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6983.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everyone was so mad about it though, Anna, when you proposed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6994.061s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What other side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6994.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are no sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7035.975s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, I, maybe you can put something in the introduction about the edits made to the charter and that you recommend if people are interested in hearing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7050.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the reasoning behind the edits made, that there are full YouTube videos of the- Which are all linked, every single one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7058.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that they can click the links to the YouTube videos for the full context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7063.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because there's extensive discussion and everybody's reasoning is laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7109.991s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7110.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that hurts to mention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7117.257s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we, I think we often have an eye toward our, our most like vulnerable folks that we're talking to, especially like in our listening sessions, maybe, or people who just aren't people who don't have computers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7127.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A lot of the folks at the senior center are like, I don't have a computer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7131.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7133.225s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and we'll give out the newsletter, but then, you know, stuff like, it doesn't always occur, but even Councilor Tseng is, I mean, he's very young, and he didn't realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7142.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He's very smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7180.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7180.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7214.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3778.33s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3780.091s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to mention that, though it would be wonderful if we could do this, we can't take a survey of every resident of the city every time we vote on something as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3793.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's why we're a representative democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3795.076s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We talk about things, we think hard thoughts about the nitty gritty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3799.678s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do the research, we learn about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3802.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We were elected by the residents to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3806.342s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: think more deeply about stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3807.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The vast majority of people that live in the city don't want to have to learn about the intricacies of ward-based representation versus at-large versus a combination versus other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3823.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The same holds for the Charter Study Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3826.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They did a ton of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3827.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They presented us with some options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3831.367s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We took them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3834.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: vast majority of the people that voted for us said, hey, we think that based on your background and what you've presented to us about who you are, you're the kind of person that we would like to make these decisions for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3847.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They may not be able to tell us what they think about each individual issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3852.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're telling us they would like us to look into it and figure it out and make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3858.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So similar to what Councilor Callahan was saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3862.903s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3864.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are doing our best here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3866.485s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would be so wonderful if we had good faith from our neighbors and the residents that we are trying hard to figure out what the best thing is that we can suggest and offer as we make these choices going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3890.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, it would be wonderful if we could pull every single resident of Medford on every single question, but we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3897.193s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And so we're just thinking hard about it and trying to figure out what the best choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3902.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4845.978s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Me first, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4849.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4852.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: mention a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4854.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first being that similar to what my colleagues have mentioned that we can sometimes disagree with our constituents or people that we frequently agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4867.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think there were even moments when the Charter Study Committee had disagreements with some of the results of the survey and didn't even include some elements of the survey that were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4880.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: respondents to the survey said they wanted one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4882.081s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That wasn't what the recommendation was because of the committee's experience and their thoughts and their opinions and what they wanted to see in the charter, and so that wasn't included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4895.758s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These things were also already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4900.001s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is similar to what we are also doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4902.442s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These things are happening in the process, throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4909.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4909.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I wanted to say is that I think like changing our mind as people who work in politics and government is a wonderful thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4918.145s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I mean, my colleague saying that he's changed his mind on such a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4922.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in such a clear and concrete way is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4924.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I have changed my mind 87 times on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4926.95s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I still, I change my mind every five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4930.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that I am going to probably end up saying that I think it's, I think I will vote for Ward-based 8 and 3 only because I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4948.028s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: because that's the main reason being because I talked to a number of people in Malden where they have word-based counsellors and the people that I've talked to who know their word counsellor have had positive experiences with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4961.016s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They like their word-based counsellor, they like having direct access to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4965.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I presented that question to people in a direct way and with no like kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4971.922s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: background, and they said, oh, yeah, I really like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4973.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4976.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I said, wow, that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4979.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was a very valuable piece of data for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4983.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Since you can't ask anybody in Medford what that's like because we've never had that, I just felt like that was useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4990.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's really, really hard to tell for a city that's never had this form of government before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5000.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think it's very frustrating when the discourse is, it's gonna be six and one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5005.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When people keep forgetting that when we voted about this in committee, I voted with Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5011.346s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nobody remembers that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5013.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are not a monolith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5014.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have frequently been voting differently from each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=5017.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6548.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to offer a motion to, I would like to vote in favor of all of Councilor Tseng's amendments, but I would like to sever one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6569.218s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6589.643s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6596.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: motion to sever the council representation portion of the... There's a motion to sever and have a vote, separate vote on council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3063.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3064.172s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3066.935s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I got one of the letters, but mine was unsure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3071.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're unsure if you have led or not, but I want to clarify some stuff about this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3080.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was a little, the letter is a little bit confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3084.768s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's so, it's not paying to replace the lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3091.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The homeowner replaces the service lines, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3095.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's a loan to help pay for, isn't it a loan that has to be paid back or the city pays to replace the lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3117.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's a different thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3122.44s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3137.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3139.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't understand this is a whole new program where you're paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3143.393s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3143.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's why it's expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3155.784s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3156.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3157.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3158.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I understand why then it makes so much sense to get all of the information about what is actually, what the service lines are made of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3171.397s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My son had elevated lead levels in his blood when he was a baby because of paint in our house when we had work done on our house that basically flaked into his crib when he was like an infant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3183.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3185.727s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's lead everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3187.582s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's all very dangerous, but it was just one incident and it never happened again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3192.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that we probably, our water is probably okay, but all of these things are kind of so hard to figure out how to, you know, take care of your family to the best of your ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3206.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm really glad that we have an opportunity here to try to mitigate some of these things in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3216.792s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a second question, which is, do you know if there, after the fire that destroyed all the records, if there's fireproof record-keeping, any changes made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3231.66s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3233.301s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3234.061s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you very much for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4462.972s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And just one thing I would like to add is that many of us in this community have strong opinions about a lot of things but but something it seems like we can almost all of us can agree on is that we think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4476.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: it would be nice if Tufts University could come to the table and meet us as an equal partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4486.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It really brings our community together when we talk about stuff like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4490.703s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it would be nice if the state house would also meet us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4496.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4497.368s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=176.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=177.889s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I came back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=178.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just need my permissions back to be able to unmute myself and turn my video on because I switched devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=586.261s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=588.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to ask really quickly if you could tell me about the estimated number for how, so I was reading through and the estimates for how many students would be housed in the building, what the timeline is for that, like how, what the stretch of time was that was anticipated for the building to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2510.865s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So moved, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L-37LV9dgxU&t=2564.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2359.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2359.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I would agree with President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2364.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We received comments from school committee member Paul Russo and school committee member or vice chair Jenny Graham both mentioned that the mayor serving as the chair while it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2379.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's great that the mayor has so much of an active role on the school committee and how much awareness that brings for that position into the school committee's decisions and actions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2401.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our mayor is already in an extremely strong position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2408.839s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, compared with other cities, the mayor's role is already a huge job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2413.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The school committee is also a huge job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2416.343s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's two huge roles, seems unnecessarily overwhelming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2425.207s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the survey results stated that people thought that it wasn't appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2432.511s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2434.332s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2435.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure about the mayor serving on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2440.289s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if it's better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2442.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think automatically serving as chair seems like not what the community asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3893.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3894.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to say one more time that I don't have a problem with the strong mayor system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3899.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many cities in Massachusetts have strong mayor systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3904.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we have already sort of moved through that section of this charter, and we've said, yes, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3909.916s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a strong mayor system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3911.037s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3912.161s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, it's just, you can have a strong mayor, uh, and you can have a legislative system in the city and you can have a school committee, but when you also give the mayor, uh, access to the school committee to this level, I think it's too, I think it's too much is, is where I think I'm falling on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3932.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3934.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we are picking and choosing the things in the data that we want to agree with and disagree with, I mean, it's hard to say what parts of the research and the surveys and the whole thing, I think we have to, as a city council, we have to look<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3963.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: carefully at what makes the most sense for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3966.425s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a mayor for a very long time, um, in Medford, and, you know, we're still seeing some of the impacts of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3974.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, uh, you know, I think we have to bear that in mind as we review this charter, and some of that is influencing the way that I'm looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3984.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4322.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4324.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm frustrated by the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4329.928s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not frustrated by the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4332.729s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I misspoke there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4334.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The comments that we received from the sitting school committee members this week on the clarity, I feel that I got from the way they spoke about the internal symmetry between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4351.44s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the two bodies, the elected bodies in Medford, helped me understand the importance of the two, both the school committee and the city council reflecting each other and that I am frustrated by the fact that they are currently in this draft of the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4376.074s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're not matching and I'm not sure how to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4384.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because the lines of the words don't match the schools, because the schools are four elementary schools and two middle schools and one high school, and you can't really assign a school committee member to a school, of course, and because that doesn't make sense anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4400.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because students age out and these things just, that doesn't really align.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4407.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4410.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: importance of school committee and city council aligning with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4416.701s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's a valuable thing to mention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4423.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: School committee member Graham and school committee member Ruseau both mentioned that specifically in their comments, and I thought that was important to note on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4433.615s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just wanted to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4435.116s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7076.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7078.879s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to motion to make a couple of the changes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7084.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: clerical changes recommended by members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7087.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the first, and I can email this, is a motion to change the title of section 4-2 to read section 4-2 school committee organization chair, vice chair, and secretary parentheses clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7104.663s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the second one is to strike the final words in section A. So have it be a period after clerks, so it wouldn't say who will each serve for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7118.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just for consistency with the section that covers city council, it doesn't dictate how long they serve for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7128.377s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7736.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7738.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7739.154s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can put them into one motion, but it's motion to change the title of section 4-2 to read, section 4-2, school committee organization, chair, vice chair, and secretary, parentheses, clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7751.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then a motion to strike final words of section 4-2A in line 13, following vice chair and secretary, clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7761.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it would, I can read the whole thing, but it would be like, it just cuts who will each serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8189.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we do ethics training, like we have to review ethics, the Code of Ethics every year for all state employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8197.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, yeah, we did a little quiz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8199.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, and I've worked here, but I also, before that, I worked at UMass Boston, I've worked at the State House, I've worked in a variety of positions, and we've had to, you always have to sort of review what you're allowed to do, and this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8213.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: standard practice for everybody who works for the state or a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8219.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I don't think that, if it was, if it is in the section for the school committee, I think it should be in the section for the city council and the section for the mayor, or it should be in none of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8233.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is just saying that it's not, you can't have this job and another job at the city at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8242.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so then I guess I'm saying it shouldn't just be in one section and not the other equivalent section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8248.775s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It should either be in both or neither.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8251.856s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I have no preference about which, personally, but not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8259.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I feel like it should, I guess, if it's an ethics violation that is already covered by the Code of Ethics for the state, I don't think it needs to be in the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=8268.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's where I stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10047.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10052.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, the current City Council, um, also holds listening sessions monthly at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10064.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the senior center, we received emails and outreach that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10072.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there was recently something that was brought forward about students whose parents were advocating for more programs for kids with disabilities to have access to programming in the recreation department without having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10094.71s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: signatures, but that's because you can email councillors and you can get on the agenda in that manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10103.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the petition to do it, to participate in public participation at the end of the agenda, as President Bears mentioned, is already accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10113.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing I would say is that with the change to either ward or district-based representation, the argument there is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10124.049s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: there would be greater access to your neighborhood's Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10130.755s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So my concern about this section is that the 25 signature requirement, I think, gives me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10148.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: an inclination that somebody could sort of flood the council with, or school committee, with petitions to have a hearing on things that are not related to the agenda of the elected council based on 25 people that did not vote for who is in office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10175.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be curious to hear if that is something that has, like, I understand this is boilerplate language, but since this isn't part of our charter now, this would be new stuff for us if you could talk to me about how other cities, if this is something that frequently happens, if there are examples of scenarios in which that would occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10197.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We already have, as we mentioned, you can just hop on public participation and that's fully allowed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10204.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So can you just talk to me about how it's done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10270.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My response is only, and I guess it's not the fact that it's here, it's the fact that we do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10281.385s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not that we need to remove it, it's just that we are doing it, but it's because our charter is two pages long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10288.327s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't have that written down right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10290.749s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We receive outreach from advocate groups or individuals asking us to do something if it's right, but you're not, you're not giving, but they don't have a stage necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10305.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10306.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10307.161s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They come and they speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10308.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They line up and speak and they do have a stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10316.851s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10317.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10318.733s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's a process that's written down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11402.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11404.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've just been reading some of our neighboring cities' websites about their petitions they have online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11410.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They have access to setting up with a petition, a petition scheme in Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11416.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You have to have 500 signatures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11421.031s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11422.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're a bigger city than us, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11424.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But they also have an extremely robust city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11429.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: everybody there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11430.593s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's much, much, much bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11435.476s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we in Medford have policies that are outliers for the way that we operate with regard to our city council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11449.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if we are trying to come in line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11453.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: with the way that other cities operate, this is not, you guys, I'm not like accusing you of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11459.609s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't mean to point myself in your direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11462.091s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we're gonna align ourselves with other cities, we need to align ourselves with other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11465.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that will mean making a lot of changes to our rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11469.455s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if we wanted to do that, we should do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11471.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But if we want to keep our public participation the way that it is now, then I don't think that it makes sense to also have a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11481.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: free petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11481.985s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we wanted to do a free petition like other cities do, then we should cut out a lot of our public participation opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11487.829s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we want to keep our public participation opportunities the way they are now, I think that takes the place of the free petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11493.597s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think it makes sense to have both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11496.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville has much smaller threshold for free petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11500.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They have, I think their numbers are very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11502.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I saw one that was like 22 signatures and it still got on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11505.382s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was something that was interesting to probably the city council as it stood at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11510.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's pretty similar to how we operate now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11512.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a lot of what ends up happening in Medford is just because we had such a short charter, we just ended up doing a lot of the stuff that we'll just be putting into the charter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11523.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: here, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11525.169s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, we should have it in a charter, it should be in a document that we follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11528.632s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We shouldn't just be like making it up as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11531.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We should have something to follow along so that when the next people come in, they have something that they can, you know, guide them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11540.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All of that being said, what I find frustrating with these conversations is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11546.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Anybody can pick and choose the things about Medford that are like special about Medford that make us different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11552.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or we can say we're not Cambridge, we're Medford, we're different and special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11556.759s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or we can say, well, we have to be like other cities or we have to be, you know, another thing that I saw was like the town of Lincoln, they have two<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11566.522s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: town meetings a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11567.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So of course they need free petitions because otherwise, like if you miss your chance, you don't get to have your thing brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11573.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like, that's entire town meeting is different than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11577.847s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Of course, but it's, it's a great it may be, but some of this language may be boilerplate but it's not, it's just not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11585.23s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: not responsive to what right it's not maybe responsive to what we're looking for but it doesn't mean that we're not um taking the the uh concerns of our residents and responding to them and uh hopefully hearing what our residents need and want and trying to make those things happen um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11608.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we do these things or don't do these things, I hope that everybody understands to the to the goal of being able to carry out the desires of the people that have elected us to perform these roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11627.98s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11631.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: are trying to figure out the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11633.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think 500 is a good threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11635.736s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also don't think 25 is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11636.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would be really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15495.358s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15496.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I initially was going to suggest that we not include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15505.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: measure for a recall for a two-year term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15509.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I, upon hearing or really like delving into the details of it, I actually think that with the restrictions President Bears articulated here, I mean, were something to rise to the level, are you guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15531.993s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: for something to rise to the level of a crisis where, you know, something would need to happen and it would be, but it would be very difficult, you know, something would have to be very, very extreme to warrant a recall of a two year elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15551.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that maybe having the opportunity for it to stay in there is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15559.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't, I actually, I think it needs to be hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15562.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It needs to be hard to recall somebody to your term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15565.978s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that I'm changing my mind and that it should stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15571.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15587.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I guess I was gonna say that we should strike it or it should be almost impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15593.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It should be like so hard that it would have to be such an egregious thing that the voters would have to be so enraged by whatever happened that they would be willing to go through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15606.172s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, the process and like, of course, the timing being difficult, at a certain point, you just like don't reelect them, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15614.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's the same difference, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15616.299s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18586.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is an extremely tiny edit, but section 911 has, it references a city clerk elect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18597.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Have we already talked about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18601.653s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18602.113s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that'll just be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18956.98s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20254.65s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate the spirit with which the amendments were proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20260.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would have been really nice if we didn't have to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20263.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I also think that it's kind of inherent in the way that we do politics that that we have these conversations and that's part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20272.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: what our voters will talk about and what they have to weigh when we openly and honestly discuss issues of compensation, our elected officials in Washington vote for their own raises too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20288.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20290.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when they do that, we factor that in to whether or not we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20296.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: reelect them or elect somebody else who says maybe they won't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20300.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's one of many things that we weigh, factors that we weigh out, and people should be doing that for us too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20307.304s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can look at the things that we've decided to do and say, you know, that was a bridge too far, and I'm not going to vote for that person again, and that's your right as a voter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20317.29s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, I kind of think that that's fair and reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20322.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we speak honestly about what we think that people in this position deserve to be paid and people on the school committee deserve to be paid and what the mayor deserves to be paid, and we stand by it, then great, you know, we're doing what we think we should be doing, and the voters should know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=283.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=284.513s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Happy Black History Month to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=287.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to read a couple of segments of some emails that I received this month honoring Black History Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=298.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These were both emails that were sent to me by influential black women, and I thought they were the most appropriate things to read to celebrate Black History Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=310.833s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first is by Andrea Campbell, Massachusetts' first black woman to be elected to a statewide office, our current Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=318.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: quote, Massachusetts is home to the movements that pushed this country to live up to its promises of freedom and equality for all of its citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=326.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Frederick Douglass started the abolition movement here in Massachusetts, and let's not forget Dr. King and Coretta Scott met as college students in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=335.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: While the work is far from over, I'm proud of the progress we've made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=338.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's now up to us to fight to defend and advance the wins of our civil rights heroes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=345.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The second thing I'd like to read is from an email sent out by Frances Nwaje, Medford's very own Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=352.945s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Frances sends out emails to city employees about various events and days of celebration, giving great history and background, and they're always a really great read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=362.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She says the National Observance of Black History Month is itself a fairly recent reality in the United States, and it was not immediately met with widespread reception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=372.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Its history begins with famous historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1926.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=379.466s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In honor of the birthdays of Frederick Douglass on February 14th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=384.824s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and President Abraham Lincoln on February 12th, two of the most important people for black American history, Woodson proclaimed the second week of February to be observed as Negro History Week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=394.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The main focus of this observance was to encourage the teaching of black American history in educational institutes, particularly at the primary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=404.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The overall reception was lukewarm, but the departments of education of Delaware, North Carolina and West Virginia were very cooperative and Woodson considered it a success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=412.738s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: After this, the idea for Black History Month was promoted by black students and educators at Kent State University in February, 1969, followed by the first celebration of Black History Month on campus and local surroundings one year later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=425.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Six years later, Black History Month was being widely celebrated across the country, not only in schools, colleges, and community centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=432.271s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In 1976, in conjunction with the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=434.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Bicentennial, President Gerald Ford praised Black History Month, urging all citizens to seize the opportunity to honor the too often neglected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=442.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=447.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to thank Frances for sharing some information with city employees and for all her work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=452.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I want to acknowledge the valuable work of her department and similar departments across Medford and encourage them to continue their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=460.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're really grateful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=462.729s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Black History Month hasn't really even been around for that long, so it's just important that we continue to celebrate it, and I'm glad to be a part of that and a part of that for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=473.171s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=931.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=934.269s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Professor Dill was not somebody that I knew personally, but somebody who was frequently outside, frequently spent time in nature, spent a long time mentoring and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=955.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: nurturing his students at Boston University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=957.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I went to Boston University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=960.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also I went to Boston University as an undergrad and a graduate student, and I worked there as a professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=969.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I didn't know Dan, but I lived in his town and I live in his neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=976.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he went out and walked his dog and he got hit by a car in a crosswalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=983.319s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And because the road that he was walking on is managed not by the city of Medford, but by a state department, it's often very frustrating to try to make changes to the infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1012.425s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that would make it safer for people to walk there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1017.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To the point that it seems like nothing can be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1023.37s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are some things that you can do to roadways to make it safer for people to walk for pedestrians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1029.733s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can make the crosswalks elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1034.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can make speed humps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1037.037s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can put flashing signs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1040.885s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But since it's the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is basically parks and rec for the whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1048.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're not like the highway administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1050.133s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They don't have that much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1052.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's, it often feels like you can't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1057.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a group of neighbors that have gathered together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1062.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's an attachment in the packet of a letter that was written by this group of neighbors and signed by a large number of them who live in the neighborhood that Professor Dill lived in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1074.527s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they are asking for changes to be made to this rotary and that strip of road so that people won't drive so fast on it and it won't be so dangerous for people to walk their dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1089.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that one thing that we should pay attention to as a city council is what we can do as elected officials and what our mandate is as representatives of our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1103.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This happened, Dan was hit in December, he died in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1107.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a week and a half ago, somebody else got hit in the rotary that's right outside this building and died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1116.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: another man in his 70s who was walking across a crosswalk in a rotary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1124.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't understand why people in Medford will be angry about all kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1134.38s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is life and death, and people are routinely getting hit by cars and dying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1144.122s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1147.098s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't understand what could be more critical and more urgent than making a speed bump or a flashing sign and putting it up and making the road safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1163.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cars have become very safe for the people inside the cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1167.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They've become very dangerous for the people who are walking on sidewalks and crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1177.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can share one piece of information, which is that our state delegation has been working with DCR, attempting to meet with DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1186.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They did meet today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1188.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Representative Garbally told me today that they met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1192.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He didn't tell me what was discussed, but he said that they're making progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1195.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm hopeful that that means that we can at least have an elevated crosswalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1203.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1205.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a number of requests, safety requests, speed warning signs for the crosswalk, rotary striping, speed enforcement by state police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1216.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would also prefer to have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1223.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh, committee meeting with the Medford Police Department and the state police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1228.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a state police barracks that's located in the Wellington neighborhood in Medford where I think we could, um, just have an open discussion about, like, how enforcement is carried out by the state police versus Medford police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1243.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't completely understand who is in charge of enforcement in which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1250.033s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1251.814s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've learned a lot from talking to people who are activists and advocates for these kind of changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1265.38s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the roads that are Medford roads exclusively, that Medford's in charge of enforcement, that is Medford police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1276.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: um, jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1277.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But when it's a road that is a state road, it's the state police is in charge of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1284.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just everything is somebody else's responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1287.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1288.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, it's especially frustrating for family members and neighbors who are concerned, um, people who have lost somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1295.755s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, and, um, I think we should all, um, be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1304.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: fighting as hard as we can to try to prevent this from happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1308.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when we talk about it, we say, somebody shouldn't have to die for things to change, but then people do die and they still don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1318.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then another person dies and they still don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1320.965s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's infuriating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1576.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1577.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that enforcement and roadway changes are two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1583.611s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think a larger conversation about traffic safety in Medford is definitely in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1590.474s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think maybe if everybody came together in one conversation that wasn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1600.054s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1600.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know if that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1601.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Accusatory or that just was everybody trying to come being on the same team trying to come together to solve the problem that everybody agrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1609.945s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is everyone's problem is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1611.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2534.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was a meeting to discuss an ordinance that Councilor Tseng drafted on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2542.818s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a gender affirming care and reproductive health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2546.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is still pending legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2892.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=269.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is the Public Health and Community Safety Committee, February 4th, 7pm, 730, 727.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=274.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=278.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Today we are going to discuss, offered by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, the resolution to draft an ordinance to secure the rights to gender affirming care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=287.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We will also be discussing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=290.882s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: um, reproductive health care in this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=294.383s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I have a couple of updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=297.664s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We, uh, attempted to run this by our legal representation before today, but they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=303.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They let us know they wouldn't have had time to review the document before this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=309.028s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They said by the end of this week, they can get a full review back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=312.87s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what they did send me was, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=318.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A little, what it was, was a press release from the Healey-Driscoll administration that included this quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=324.494s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says, in Massachusetts, gender-affirming health care is a legally and constitutionally protected right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=331.016s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Healey-Driscoll administration is committed to ensuring the protection of that right, both for Massachusetts residents and those who travel to the Commonwealth for care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=339.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Chapter 127 of the Acts of 2022, an act expanding protections for reproductive and gender affirming care, codifying these measures, ensuring the Commonwealth's ability to protect patients from out-of-state legal action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=353.062s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It also gave gender-affirming care providers the ability to enroll in the Commonwealth's Address Confidentiality Program, ACP, to ensure privacy and safety for their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=363.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was a press release from 2023 that had many quotes from different leadership at the state level affirming the state's commitment to gender-affirming care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=377.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: gender-affirming care, reproductive health care, safety in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=382.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, we still felt it was valuable and important to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=390.364s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: During this presidential administration, we're not sure of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=397.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're not sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=399.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how things could go and shoring up what our residents are asking us to shore up is valuable, we think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=408.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've been hearing from some citizen advocacy groups and we're going to follow through with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=418.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: those measures and this ordinance was already in the pipeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=421.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've been talking about it for a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=423.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we have a draft that you all received and hopefully you had a chance to look it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=429.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It covers, you know, some language that was borrowed from other municipalities that sort of talks about, you know, these sorts of healthcare providers will be protected in Medford and not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=447.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: prosecuted or, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=451.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That sort of like that sort of language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=453.069s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if anybody if sorry, but I've been speaking so much because this is really Councilor Tseng this project, so I will let you take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=461.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=463.076s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Wait one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=464.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=466.098s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I forgot how to use the mix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=470.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=470.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=476.5s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I touch it and then I touch what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=478.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=832.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=834.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I did share this draft with the Director of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=842.248s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the health department and the chief of police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=845.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't hear back, but that doesn't mean that they don't have, you know, an interest or stake in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=851.996s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just means they probably have other pressing matters going on, which I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=858.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it may just be a matter of, you know, following up again, we do still have to get affirmative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=866.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: response from our legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=868.748s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's going to we're not going to be able to necessarily pass this out of committee tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=874.671s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's also possible that we could move forward with this, and then come back to it if we wanted to add something about prescription medication at a later time with an amendment like we did with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=886.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that we're not trying to do the work of another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=889.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Municipality another state or the federal government or anybody else's policies or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=916.772s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: those goals for another group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=920.214s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not our role, it's not our responsibility, and it's not something that we wanna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=925.116s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments from other members of the council about the draft that you saw or thoughts or motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=935.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1119.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think it would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1121.343s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, to keep it in committee, we've been scheduling these pretty swiftly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1127.807s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We could even meet on Zoom if we needed to just move it along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1133.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think either is, I mean, it's up to you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1136.931s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can't make questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=987.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd like to state that in the form of an ordinance, just to make an amendment to that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=994.73s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you want me to email that to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1018.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe do councils are do you have any more comments or that's all I just wanted to motion to add the it that unless<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1029.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just says, sorry, I'll read it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1031.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'll read it out again for clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1032.741s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cause I basically read the sentence backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1035.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The mayor shall appoint subject to the review of such appointments by the city council under section two dash nine, all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the charter or ordinance is the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1052.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's basically saying the mayor appoints subject to the review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1058.572s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: by City Council, all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies, unless that is in conflict with something in the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1068.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm just adding unless that's in conflict with something in an ordinance, specifically because of the Human Rights Commission in Medford, that may be looking to avoid, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1082.818s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: just looking to account for diversity and inclusion in the appointment of multiple member bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1089.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's the intention of this motion, but I will write out that full sentence and email that to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=74.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Test one, two, test one, two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=723.317s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=724.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Those are two separate meetings if we don't if we're not bothered by when the things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=731.039s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't bother me either, but I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=734.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=734.807s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The previous newsletters had them separated by date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=976.829s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I can't hear the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=982.674s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The clerk said something I can't hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1713.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1714.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1716.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's something that I'm not very familiar with, so I appreciate people with greater awareness and understanding of these topics to bring it to the floor and bring it to the departments in the city where it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1730.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My hesitation comes from the awareness that our city hall is pretty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1739.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: minimally staffed kind of bare bones to some degrees and that if a project like this would be difficult to pull off or would ask city hall staffers to engage in something that's beyond their capacity or we would have to, or really is this like a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1765.415s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: budgetary thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1766.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would we have to add this to the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1768.896s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there going to be a cost associated with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1770.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm asking because I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2043.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2044.731s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think my point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2052.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's important that we, this is sort of a big picture issue, but I think it's important that we as a council, and I'm not saying that this is not an important issue, but I think it's critical that we focus our attention to the greatest degree possible on the things that are most critical for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2074.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is the resident services committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2077.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that this is important, but also if we have an extra,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2082.455s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: extra time available in any department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2087.397s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can't imagine that anybody has extra time because Boston and Somerville and Cambridge all have staff in all of their departments that are like many times larger than the staff in our departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2099.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they also have many more departments than we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2102.845s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They have an Office of Housing Stability, for instance, which we do not possess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2106.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like Councilor Callahan just said, like we don't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2109.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: any departments to deal with housing at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2112.049s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, as as good as it is to have open data and things posted online to help people when people are like, not able to find a place to live, they don't have anything that they can do to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2125.693s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So like the data wouldn't really necessarily be as critical in that moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2130.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I am curious to hear if this is something that we could put a dollar amount on, I would like to know what it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2138.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and if there's something, if there's, if there's funding that we need to find for it, we should find funding for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2144.138s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, um, I just, I want to make sure that we're not, um, giving anybody on funded mandates because there's enough of that statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2153.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, all of that stuff is just difficult to manage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2155.761s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, um, I'm just putting that out there into the universe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2158.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I still, I think this is still a good initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2161.023s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not saying it's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2162.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just saying, I'm thinking about that stuff more and more lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2165.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2355.09s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2358.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: agree with that and I also wanted to say that I think that having even if you have a list of best practices and like a like a goals document um or like a phase one phase two phase three kind of document I think that's um a really good thing to have um my work in non-profit in the non-profit sphere I work in a the warming center where it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2384.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we're extremely scrappy, we can't actually achieve a lot of our best practice goals operationally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2390.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So sometimes we have like, this is what we would like to be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2393.578s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is what we're actually doing because this is what we're capable of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2397.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, I mean, I think that that's still, it's still good to start some place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2402.442s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's, I just wanted to put that out there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2616.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Again, I seconded it from over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2636.72s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No more Zoom erasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2190.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, I just very briefly wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2194.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2196.885s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, I just very briefly wanted to mention that I will be as a function of the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2202.207s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We hold listening sessions around the city for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2207.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This one will be at the Medford Senior Center on Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2209.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would be a great opportunity if anybody has any other follow-up questions, wants to be directly connected to the Assessor's Office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2217.351s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can also bring some materials to clear some things up if people have questions about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2222.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: their own situations, but we can continue this conversation there on Thursday at noon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2228.758s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I and maybe Councilor Leming will be there as well for a listening session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2233.581s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that would be a great opportunity to talk about this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2237.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2240.286s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4207.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also am in favor of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4209.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's an important discussion to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4211.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would be a great thing to discuss in committee, and I echo what Councilor, or Vice President Collins said about meeting the parking director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4221.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be very eager to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4223.491s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've also heard a lot of things from residents about the frustration with the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4226.413s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Schiaparelli, and I'm in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4230.955s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4583.233s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4583.673s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am willing to, well, I'm willing to withdraw this if it is unnecessary because the rules do already state that, and we're just routinely suspending our rules and leaving people who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4605.805s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: attempting to come in and open businesses in Medford to sit through very long City Council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4612.67s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the purpose of this resolution is to remind not only the City Council, but also everybody in Medford, everybody in the region that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4634.298s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: here is to make sure that we're creating an environment where businesses feel that Medford is a place that is friendly and open and is a place where you can easily and freely come get approved for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4656.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a storefront to open your business, extend your hours if you would like to, if it's rational and logical, you can have a place that's open for business that makes our community more vibrant, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4674.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, makes money for you and your family and your community and brings in tax revenue for our city, which then we can use for services for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4682.487s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is what makes a city operational and what makes it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4687.37s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, um That's what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4691.552s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4699.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: rational way to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4702.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These are business meetings where people have come and set aside time in their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4706.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's already the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4707.716s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's already starting in the evening, and it's important for us to keep that in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4711.92s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's why I wanted to bring this forward, and I appreciate the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4717.024s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5197.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would absolutely agree with that and partly that's the intention of this resolution is to kind of remind us that we don't always have to, and we also don't always have to say yes when somebody wants to suspend the rules any number of people want to suspend the rules and we do it frequently right sometimes sometimes for good reason we need to pull something out because it's ready for a third reading that needs to happen at whatever time but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5221.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For my piece, I can say that sometimes I'm not quite sure what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5226.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, I'm not quite paying, I'm like, what number is, like, I may need sometimes to ask for a pause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5234.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I may need to say, are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5236.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I might wanna vote no on this suspension of the rules for this moment, because I happen to know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5243.454s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That in this case, when the establishment, the business owner of the establishment was here I had been speaking with her before, because we knew somebody in common we were talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5254.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I knew that she was here and then I happened to notice that she was still here and I was like she is still here she was there until 11pm with her lawyer waiting all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5263.967s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I had been paying closer attention, if I had been on top of things the way I should have been, I would have said, you know what, actually I vote no on suspending the rules and let's take that first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5277.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that the larger implication here and the thing that I really wanna make sure I'm stating clearly is that when you put out a message to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5290.833s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When you give the impression to a group of people in the business community that when you need a liquor license, it might take you five hours of sitting in a room, where if you do it in another town, it won't happen that way, then it doesn't, it has nothing to do with being a city Councilor who has to stay here for five hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5311.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5312.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We will be here regardless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5315.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a matter of making sure that people who are business owners who want to do business in our city, which we want to encourage, do not feel that it's an imposition for them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5323.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We want to encourage them to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5326.2s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's my intention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5328.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that it's possible that this paper will not turn out to be appropriate because of the way that it's written and the way that the rules are, but I'm comfortable with it going to governance and us talking it over there and maybe making amendments in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5342.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: but I appreciate you all entertaining it and discussing it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6370.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6371.084s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: At the committee of the whole I had expressed a slight concern that being a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford that it would be a conflict of interest potentially to vote for an appropriation for the facade but I researched it and having not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6391.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't stand to gain anything financially from appropriating these funds myself personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6397.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Councilor Leming is also a member of that church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6402.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Neither of us stand to gain anything because we obviously we don't, we're just members of the church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6407.051s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't stand to gain anything financially from approving this appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6412.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I believe it is ethically appropriate for us to vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6418.136s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we don't need to sever that portion from the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6422.759s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6783.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was going to say that same thing that the number struck me as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6788.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I asked a similar question, but I felt that it was a valid thing to spend a lot of money on because it is something that brings revenue into the city on a consistent basis and something that you want your facilities to be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6804.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So people continue to rent them and they're rented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6809.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: for a fee by many organizations, I mean, year round, and maybe not right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6815.869s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that, you know, we want to maintain those facilities so that people want to keep renting them, and then we bring in the revenue for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6823.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that felt valid, especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6827.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But thank you for asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8262.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8264.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know why there's an impression that it's urgent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8269.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just, I mean, it's on the agenda today, but I don't think it's necessarily urgent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8273.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think it's an available parcel of land that we've done nothing with since, or two available parcels of land that we've done nothing with since 1950, and we have an affordable housing trust that's largely unfunded, and we could sell these parcels, we could put that money into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8292.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a fund that could build affordable housing, so why wouldn't we, especially as housing prices increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8299.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a good use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8300.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we want to change some of the language to be more specific, I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8307.646s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't seem desperate or urgent to me, so I think it would be fine to hold until the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8315.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we wanted to clarify some of the language, I would be comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8320.577s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: verify confirm say for sure this will be in accordance with the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8329.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: sold to whoever is going to comply with our specific zoning requirements and not build outside of those requirements, but that whatever proceeds will come out of it will go into the Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8345.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we could write that into this, I think that would be appropriate if it's not clear enough here now, because that would be the only reason that I would approve this as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8357.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8627.915s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8630.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If the city council appropriates the funds when the parcels are sold, then I am comfortable voting on this tonight because they legally cannot say this will be used for affordable housing because we say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8645.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So does that, Attorney Everett, does that sound correct to you, the way I phrased that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9454.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The listening session is advertised in the newsletter of the Senior Center, and it'll also be in the newsletter that we're releasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9470.405s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: from the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9472.926s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a meeting tomorrow to revise that and that will be released after that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9479.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I am not aware of how things go on the events calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9486.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Pam Kelly is the director of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9491.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Senior Center, so she puts it in the, we tell her a month ahead of time, she puts it on the newsletter for the Senior Center, so it's like a paper newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9502.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It also gets emailed out if you're on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9547.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9548.585s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The idea is to be in the community in the spaces where people are gathered and to be reaching out to different groups in the community and meeting them where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9560.769s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But while I'm here, if I can make a motion to adjourn, I will do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9565.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If there are no other public participation folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=611.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=612.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to acknowledge that from the perspective of one of my previous modes of employment was writing and having a really solid draft that is so foundational and so well-written and well-studied and has so much work that's put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=637.009s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so grateful to have this to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=640.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: with and so grateful to the committee and all of the work that they've put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=645.963s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I agree that the preamble is really lovely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=648.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first article, I don't have anything that I would want to edit, but I just really appreciate everything that we have to start with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=657.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a lot of things that I'd like to say later on tonight, but there's, I just, it's so much easier to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=668.487s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: doing further work when you have something that's really good to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=676.632s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just want to say thank you to the Charter Study Committee for that grueling work, all of that research, all of those conversations with the public, and all of the work that they did at the Collins Center, and express my gratitude for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=691.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you all very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1703.979s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did have a quick question on section two, five, actually, sorry, two, five, subsection three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2160.23s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a question just about the process of amending the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2164.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2165.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We change the city council rules in city council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2170.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But if it's in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2173.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's an ordinance, it needs three readings, uh, to change an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.173s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.674s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2187.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just as a reminder, or maybe just for the public record, if we can just quickly go over how we change the rules, we do that with a resolution in city council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2250.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I had a question about 2-5 section B subsection 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2257.362s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says all sessions of the City Council and of every committee or subcommittee of the City Council shall be open to the public unless another provision is allowed by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2265.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The only thing that comes to mind is executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2268.291s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that's allowed by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2269.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't happen very frequently in our meetings, but I just wonder if that's something we would want to say officially in the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2279.296s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's not necessary, we don't need to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2281.217s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just occurred to me to ask about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2317.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's fine, that's sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2318.575s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm comfortable with that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3641.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3644.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If a vacancy occurs in the office of Councilor at large, that position is filled by, is it pulled from one of the ward Councilors based on votes received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3661.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm confused about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3662.866s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or one of the people who was running for at large, as long as they didn't get less than 30, but you had to have been running for at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3682.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4455.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If the intention of this would be to make the ordinances be in alignment with an updated charter, maybe it could say, with every change to the charter, may there be an update or a review of ordinances to align with the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4473.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This section looks like, and it does say at five-year intervals and each year ending in a seven or a two, it doesn't say every time you update the charter, you'll review all the ordinances to see that they're in alignment with the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4485.975s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there's no implication in this language that that is why it's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4491.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To me, I read this and I thought it was saying there's a special committee appointed to read all of the local ordinances of the city and review them, which I always understood to be the work of city council and what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4506.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: on a regular basis anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4509.034s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I thought this was at best redundant as a section to work that's already being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4517.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe I think my amendment to President Bears's motion would be to say, upon review or changes made to the city charter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4535.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and then the rest of this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6016.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6017.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to organize my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6019.235s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I wrote some stuff down that I wanted to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6022.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've changed my mind back and forth on this issue a number of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6027.761s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When I was running for office, one of my primary issues was word-based representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6034.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really, really difficult for a new candidate to run for office across the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6039.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6040.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really time consuming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6043.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's hard when you have a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6044.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's hard when you have a family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6046.387s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to run for office for the first time in a city of 60,000 residents when you've never done it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6054.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was very difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6060.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I still believe that it would be easier to run in one ward than it would across the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6066.12s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would also be easier to run in two wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6069.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All of that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6071.437s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The more I've looked at it and talked to residents and talked to members of the Charter Study Committee, it's becoming more clear to me that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6090.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's become clear to me that the work of the study committee has shown that the residents and the emails that I'm getting and the conversations that I'm having are telling me that the residents are interested in word based representation and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6104.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this would increase the number of city councillors significantly and would make our meetings which are already much too long, prohibitively too long, which is also a barrier for people running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6116.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These meetings are a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6118.385s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um and with 11 city councillors, they will be Way too long, and that is something else we will have to talk about, which is a rules change, which we have tried to implement and It hasn't changed very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6133.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These are things, these are all things to talk about, but if we want to make these roles accessible to our residents, all of these things need to be talked about together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6143.122s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Medford is an outlier in a few ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6145.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe one of the ways is that our city council is small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6147.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another one of the ways is that we do public participation on every agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6152.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When you do public participation on every agenda item, it makes your meetings very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6158.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That means that we are up in here until 11, 12, 1 in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6161.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6164.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have another job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6165.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody else has another job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6167.781s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many of us have kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6170.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6171.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have obligations at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6174.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if there are 11 of us with no restrictions on city councilors talking and no limit to the time that we're here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6184.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is also a barrier to people running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6187.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So when we talk about expanding the opportunities for people to be involved in their city government, we have to really talk about the actual barriers that people face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6204.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, in order to increase diversity in our elected offices, we're not going to go to somebody's door in the ward where we know it's more diverse and knock on the doors, the people of color and the women and the queer people and say, Hey, we need you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6219.342s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You have to come do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6221.276s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: job that's really difficult, you have to stay up really late and get abused by the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6227.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You have to do it because that's your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6229.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not fair to do that to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6231.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not fair to ask that of people without protecting, to some degree, people that are serving in these roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6238.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think if we really care about having people come and be representatives and be involved in local government,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6248.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's about much more than just what I think the Charter Study Committee and I also, when I was running as a candidate, came in with what we all did with a pure heart saying, let's open up this opportunity, which I still think that we probably should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6270.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is our pure heartedness was to say, let's make this easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6277.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Let's also make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6280.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Let's also pass the ordinances that make this a welcoming place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6283.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Let's also make everything about City Hall accessible and genuinely good and safe for everyone, all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6295.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't happen just with one element falling into place, but with all of these elements coming in together at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6308.118s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I keep going back and forth because I feel very conflicted about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6312.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I will probably decide to support word-based representation based on the communications that I've had with people this week and last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6322.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I would have a lot of thoughts about what would have to go along with that in order to make it feasible in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6336.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I respect that this came from research and surveys and communications with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6345.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6349.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8079.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8080.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, as a point of information, correct something that was said earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8084.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It may have been missed because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8089.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One of my colleagues got up and walked around while I was talking, but I was trying to address some of the nuance to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8098.19s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I like ward representation and I will be voting for ward representation, but it is nuanced and complicated and it doesn't automatically equal a more diverse council and it doesn't automatically mean<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8116.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that everything is solved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8117.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that it will require a lot of work from all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8122.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that is what I was trying to communicate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8124.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will be I think I will be voting for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8129.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm just I think that we deserve our that our residents deserve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8137.641s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and open and honest discussion of the nuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8140.204s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't begrudge the Charter Study Committee for not presenting the public with like 14 different options for ways to organize government that are not commonly done in America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8154.487s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it would have been great if we could have tried that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8158.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I also think that it's rational to not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8161.873s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8164.375s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I want to draw attention to is that there is a section of the charter draft that we have, which is Article 9, the general provisions 9.1<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8174.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: mentions charter changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8176.208s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This charter may be replaced, revised, or amended in accordance with any procedure made available under the state constitution or by the general laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8182.11s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then there's another section about periodic review of the charter that mentions every 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8186.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can go back and review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8187.211s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think it's necessary that we wait 40 years in between reviewing the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8193.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can try something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8196.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8197.513s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It should be reviewed every 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8200.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This draft says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8202.981s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: review it every 10 years and every 10 years thereafter, like after 10 years and 10 years thereafter, if it's not, if there's something that happens that occurs with a model that we try, it can be reviewed and changed, it's written in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8216.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that is much better than what happened the last time around and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8225.553s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we have observed in this country some of the drawbacks to a lot of the models for government that we've tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8235.538s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are obviously a lot of problems with elections in this country, a lot of problems with our legislative bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8243.942s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it can be really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8246.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm not sure that we can solve all of the issues right now in Medford, but I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8255.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What I feel I've been presented with is a clear preference from the public for what was offered by the Charter Study Committee in this respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8272.953s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I agree that the district option is a greater recommendation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8281.615s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: opportunity for representation than what we have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8286.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But since every communication I've received from a member of the public, almost every communication I've received has said, I would like to see eight ward based Councilors plus three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8300.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's what I have to say that I will support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15312.021s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you, should we be voting throughout in that case, and then taking all of what we've voted on and bringing it to committee of the whole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15323.955s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Finally, are you asking President Bears to suffer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15327.297s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know what, how, how that would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15367.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: but we should keep voting on these motions as they come up and then presenting this in committee of the whole and then that goes to regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15493.758s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would disagree with the characterization of kicking the can down the road where I would call it giving it due diligence and we're just gonna have to work really hard and we're gonna have to go to a lot of meetings and I think that we will just do it quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15506.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We'll just have to meet more frequently and we'll get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15512.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm willing to work hard if you're willing to work hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15514.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=797.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=801.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I should recuse myself from that portion of the discussion for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1698.702s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1700.383s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They are in pretty rough shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1701.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've played there every once in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1703.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1703.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a great asset to our community, so I'm glad we're addressing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1707.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was wondering if you could speak to, you may not have these numbers, but since it does mention in the report that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1714.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's rented by outside organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1717.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this being something I think we should keep in mind that this is an expensive item, but it is also an income generating item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1726.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it does make sense for us to put more money into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1730.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's bringing money into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1732.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you know how much money it like these courts rent for or how much it brings in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1748.322s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe for our next time talking about it, it'll have to be at the regular meeting, too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1752.124s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1753.845s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1762.617s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a curiosity for me more than anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1764.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think that it's worth noting when we have facilities that are part of our city assets that if we can keep them up and then they bring other organizations into the city that pay rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1783.552s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And our pool is one of the things, the high school, tennis courts, various recreational facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2308.791s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2309.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does it delay the work at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3292.316s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think my impulse was sort of an abundance of caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3295.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3297.5s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I will probably abstain tonight, but this isn't the vote to finally, finally approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3304.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's probably not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3308.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And just as an example, the mayor abstained from a vote in which her sister was maybe standing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3318.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: benefit directly financially from something that she would have voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3322.042s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that seems like a clear situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3324.604s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In this case, it would just be, this is actually a very community-like repair work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3331.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not a financial benefit to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3494.791s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3495.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3497.732s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a great program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3498.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that can be a very prohibitive thing for families, the startup costs of moving, relocating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3507.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you are exiting homelessness, just the beginning, the first month of payments can be really difficult to overcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3518.217s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this sounds like a great program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3519.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to ask if there are programs in other communities that you're aware of where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3525.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the community, the municipality, will cover these costs through different avenues, or if you offer this kind of programming in other cities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3535.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Out of curiosity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3549.934s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I heard recently about broker fees being less of an issue soon, maybe, hopefully, or now, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3558.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that seems promising, because that can also be problematic for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3563.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this seems like a really, really good program and a really good use of our funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3566.461s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3568.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=67.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1891.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1892.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you both being here and telling us about this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1895.792s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It can feel frustrating and dark, and I agree with Chair Callahan that actually this is helpful for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1907.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a lot of our conversations publicly or when people start talking about it online, it's like the streets are so bad, the sidewalks are so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1916.56s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're battling nature, we're battling backlog, we're battling all of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1921.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1921.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The earth does not want us to have streets on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1926.145s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we are insisting on doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1928.346s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Anyway, so we are always going to be, you know, fighting this battle but it's it's necessary and it's important so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1936.885s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: travel to and fro, and that people with mobility issues are always being prioritized and all of that stuff, and we're trying all the time, we're trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1944.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just see the work that you're doing, and as difficult and insurmountable as it seems, it's good, important work, and we have to keep doing it, and we have to pay for it as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1960.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we have to keep showing up and trying, and paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=1965.679s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2241.481s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I have two thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2244.063s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first is I just got an email from the planning department about Trees Medford and their program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2254.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Trees Medford is a nonprofit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2256.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: their program offering free trees to specific neighborhoods that are like hotter neighborhoods or neighborhoods in Medford in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2266.094s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know they operate as a nonprofit and have their own infrastructure for tree planting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2271.097s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2272.178s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not super familiar with them, but it would probably be worth having conversations with existing organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2283.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe you already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2285.742s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't want to presume, but yes, but the other thing I wanted to say is that because of work that I've done with the Malden warming center which is an almost entirely volunteer organization, and is a nonprofit on its own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2303.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We I'm the president of the board of directors this year, but the last two years I was the assistant director and the our work is volunteer based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2314.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a volunteer coordinator and all of our staff are volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2320.152s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nobody gets paid for those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2322.233s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: for the work that they do, but everybody has to have a quarry, everybody has to have training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2327.276s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The volunteer coordinator does put in a lot of time, but everybody kind of goes into it knowing what they're getting into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2334.039s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The time that they put in is extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2337.981s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody puts in a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2339.502s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it's kind of part of the mission of the organization that it's like, what if we could do it all volunteer-based?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2345.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And pretty much everybody in the beginning, the executive director, when he started it, said, what if we did a volunteer-based?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2351.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And everybody said, you won't be able to do it volunteer-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2354.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he was like, what if I just did it anyway?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2356.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that was kind of how it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2360.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The model is really unusual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2362.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's uncommon, but it's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2369.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it does take a lot of people doing a lot of work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2374.187s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a lot of time for no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2376.11s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think the more common thing, especially when you're doing it with a municipality as part of a department, would be to hire somebody to bring people in, especially if people in neighborhoods wanted to do things for their own neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2387.315s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would be a more traditional pathway to put something into the budget for somebody to do the coordinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2393.378s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because frankly, the work that our volunteer coordinator does, and she's been doing it for a number of years, she has another full-time job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2399.941s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know how she does this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2401.582s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She is like on the phone with people in the middle of the night, because we're open every night, all night long for four months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2407.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She's like always coordinating somebody to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2410.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2410.866s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2416.301s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's an outlier example, but it does take a lot of coordinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2422.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This would be a smaller scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2424.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess what I'm saying is it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2426.205s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It needs a lot of forethought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2430.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it's great, and I think we should do it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6bZISOstiw&t=2438.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The end of my comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2502.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, I won't take much time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2503.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to say I'm very excited about this opportunity and that services are often offered by a city because they spring from what residents demand for their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2513.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if other cities are offering this, we should be offering it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2517.895s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm very eager to hear from our parents and community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2521.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you very much for bringing it to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4160.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4160.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to mention this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4162.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh it it feels like a moment when Medford is no longer doing the bare minimum in our city services and I think it's it's uh a good time for us to consider what what we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4175.37s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: where we could meet the needs of our residents, where we hear what they're asking for and where we can step up to the plate and provide them with the services that they request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4187.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think this is a great moment to meet those needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4190.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I applaud that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4192.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4195.722s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I wanted to mention is that something that Melanie said about integrating children with disabilities with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4205.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: children that are developing traditionally, there are studies that say it benefits everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4211.406s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's good for all kids of all developmental levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4217.588s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's part of the discussion too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4223.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I also, just a small correction, I think Gracie is in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4226.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think she's 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4228.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't just... Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15067.364s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15253.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15600.288s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15661.614s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15863.646s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for bringing that up, Mr. Fiore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15866.889s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I agree that this meeting lasted too long, and the meeting on December 17th also lasted too long, and I had to go home because I also have kids, and I have to get up early with them every single morning, no matter how late the meetings go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15880.922s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And as Vice President Collins mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15888.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this council did attempt to deal with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15892.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It hasn't really been as successful as we would have hoped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15895.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, I'm definitely interested and willing to find a way to solve this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15902.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But thanks for your willingness to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15905.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=830.761s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=357.955s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1665.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1665.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to note that this is something that's come up in my discussion with residents lately a lot, especially about what happens to be the neighborhood that I live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1675.378s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: West Manfred Square has a lot of empty storefronts, and it's just been a common discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1683.263s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd love to help support any conversations you're having, Councilor Leming, if it's helpful at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1689.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if you need a backup on this, I'd be happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1974.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1975.341s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1976.061s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, um I know you were you're trying to move forward, but paid family medical leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1982.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think I missed what you said about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1984.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If anything, is there any possibility of that moving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1988.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this year, do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2031.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3298.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3298.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just also want it similarly to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3301.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's reminding me of some of the things I've been discussing with some residents and other lawmakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3308.653s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've been meeting with, we passed recently the asking DCR and MassDOT to lower the speed limit in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3322.329s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that was never in a committee so I wonder where in the governing agenda, we would put something like that like accomplishments from other that never needed to go to committee ended up being something that we just passed in regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3334.638s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it does kind of fall under the one of the things that Councilor Collins mentioned about like bike safety made me think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3342.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just had a meeting today that would be sort of like an ongoing discussion of like how to implement, what are the other areas?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3350.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somebody had an accident recently, we were sort of talking about like how best to address some of those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3355.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm curious about like, you know, where do we put things that aren't actually like, they're not a paper number, but they're ongoing issues that are like discussions with DCR about how to implement traffic mitigation measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3446.653s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess the question would only come up for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3449.574s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not as important a thing if it's something that's so simple that it's done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3455.136s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But in this case, I think it's traffic mitigation that's going to be a continual project, especially with conversations that we have to have in an ongoing manner with DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3469.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And something that came up today was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3476.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I guess this would be a paper I would introduce in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3478.984s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe this is something that's a new discussion, but how to support state-level goals to do with traffic cameras that might be introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3491.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that's something that would be state-level, and we would be maybe just a support player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3496.31s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But since it's something that was passed at our level but does require follow-up, I guess that's the, that's like, where would that live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3765.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3765.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we are at Public Health and Community Safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3770.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We met a fair amount this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3774.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will start at the major projects that we only met one time to talk about the warm air and cooling center, just an overview that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3784.074s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is a project that has kind of been backburnered, not because of lack of interest, but because of cost and more emergent issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3799.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's also alternative emergency responsibility and oversight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3803.698s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's something that we can definitely discuss going forward, as well as One Stop Center for Public Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3809.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These are things that were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3810.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: offered before I came in to lead this committee, but I'm happy to address them as they're presented, yet the One-Stop Center hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3820.874s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: hasn't been assigned a paper number, but the things that we did talk about this year was 24021 was plant medicine decriminalization resolution that was in support of something that was at the state level, which we did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3836.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's the overgrowth ordinance, which we are in process of working on, and updates to the rodent control ordinance, which is new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3845.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's something we have also been working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3848.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we were meeting closely with the director of the board of health, um, talking about how this is all of these ordinances kind of work together to, um, mitigate, uh, complications with, um, things that happen in the city that end up contributing to rodent issues that if we address them all in conjunction, it can, um, mitigate those problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3870.663s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, these things come from the board of health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3874.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and then they come to us and we can implement those suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3879.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We did the wildlife feeding ordinance that was a lot of meetings, and it resulted in an ordinance that is now on the books, which is great and exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3892.257s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there's some other stuff that we haven't taken up yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3895.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Regulating retail sales of animals, that hasn't been taken up yet, but I'd be happy to do that when it comes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3901.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have recently had a meeting about gender affirming care and reproductive health care protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3906.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to take this up again soon because it's one of these kind of emergent things similar to CCOPS, which we, I mean, I'll get to that in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3917.186s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, it's not even on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3919.368s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think probably because we should probably add it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3923.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the civilian, what does it stand for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3930.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3930.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Community control over public surveillance ordinance was established and already part of our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3941.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But we were closing a couple of loopholes and making it even stronger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3948.884s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in response to requests from our community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3953.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that was something that just came up very recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3957.769s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we completed it just last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3961.091s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, that was something that was already complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3965.814s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think it wouldn't have even occurred to us that we would come back into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3970.016s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, these things kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3972.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: come from the community, we respond to their requests, and we make it happen as people speak to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3979.192s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it becomes clear that it's something the community wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3981.654s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3983.274s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's something that just came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3986.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Health Care Protection Ordinance will be another thing like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3991.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's something I'm eager to take up early in 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3998.448s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, another thing is an ongoing thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4000.349s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Surveillance ordinance reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4001.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's that's the C cups ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4003.069s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's a regular reporting requirement of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4005.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had 11 instance of Chief Buckley coming in doing a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4010.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe that happens again next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4013.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, housing stability, notification ordinance implementation and enforcement is, um and emergency response equipment replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4023.296s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's a future thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4025.756s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this is something that we review annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4028.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So yeah, I think I'm in lieu of taking too much more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4032.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know we had a very long meeting yesterday, but I think I will just stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4038.408s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm very eager to continue with the work of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4043.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's been fruitful and useful, and I'm excited to keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4095.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A worse job for the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4101.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: vote again voted out by rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=811.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I nominate Councilor Kit Collins for vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1345.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, at this committee meeting, we discussed edits to the CCOPS ordinance, which will also be presented at tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2868.456s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, thank you for your presentation, I think we can also probably watch the school committee meeting from yesterday in between now and when we have our committee of the whole and review that presentation as well which could be really beneficial to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2880.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel comfortable voting yes for this I also think that when you mentioned the gremlins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2885.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There may have been, I'm not sure if this happened, but there may have been some measures taken in the prior projects being done that we could avoid this time around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2897.969s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Hopefully we won't have gremlins in this project and we can have just a really solid foundation with this HVAC system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2906.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would hope we could avoid that this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2909.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you, I appreciate you coming here and presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2913.518s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8170.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8174.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The only reason I will vote no on this first issue is because it's a school committee issue and because of the separation of powers in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8185.744s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not because it's not interesting, not because it doesn't, it may not have a budgetary impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8191.586s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We will see the budgetary impact when it is pertinent to our body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8197.724s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's it's it's like the main job of school committee is to oversee hire non-renew, rehire, start a search committee, this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8208.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is what school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8209.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what City Council does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8211.016s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9219.773s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, can you just repeat what the amended for me, what the amended motion was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9739.866s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9741.187s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9743.429s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would also say if it would make sense, we could hold it in the public health and community safety committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9749.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then if we could leave the committee to executive session, I don't know if that's common, but that way we would avoid any open meeting on violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9756.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know if that's, if this meeting would be in open, in an open session or not, but the, it seems to me as a community, as a public safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9767.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: organization, the fire department, we could do it in committee if that makes more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13156.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13157.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to clarify one thing that this is something that is already in practice for the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13163.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed this in our committee meeting at length, but I did want to say for folks gathered here today that may not have been at the committee meeting that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13174.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When we put something like this in an ordinance, it's much more difficult if something were to change down the road to, you know, change a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13186.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is something you can do kind of quickly to change an ordinance, it would be much more complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13190.714s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we're enshrining something that is practiced now in our city ordinances so that it's something that we are affirming and saying that it is something that we believe in very firmly, that this is something that is part of our local laws and it will be hard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13212.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: turn around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13214.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's something that I think is very important, and I think it's important that we're doing it tonight, and I appreciate all the work that's gone into it thus far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13220.773s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20760.771s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would have been a great idea for one of the many planning and permitting committee meetings that we've had already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20767.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I mean, well, it was never a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20769.479s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was never proposed as a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20775.324s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Community Development Board is not this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=452.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this is a meeting of the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=458.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we are meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=463.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, December 11th 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=468.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To discuss the some edits to the, um C Cops ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=478.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, clerk, can you please call the role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=491.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=491.97s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=493.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=494.851s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will hand it over to Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=502.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=743.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, would you like to share the portion of the proposed amendments on Zoom or on the screen so that we can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=754.507s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=755.648s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Hang on one sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=800.191s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is also on the website under today's, on today's agenda as part of our packet for tonight, the full ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=990.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1054.608s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm getting used to the mic system still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1057.67s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1127.327s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Similarly, I would assume the whole ordinance would have been run by Council prior to passage previously and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1139.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess this is a question for Vice President Collins as well, that when that came up, that probably was addressed, or is the assumption that ordinances written by City Council are only applicable to matters that are addressed by our police department, our, you know, city services, our, you know, municipal, only in the realm of municipal services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1167.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, in thinking about this, you think about like our tree ordinance, which does have something to do with private property, to some degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1172.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, I guess, like, how explicit are we trying to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1233.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1360.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, can you repeat that one more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1362.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the clerk has, this is an amendment to the language of the first proposed addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1371.553s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: her legal counsel, and what was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1381.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you say it one more time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1425.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1426.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, that covers the first section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1429.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1434.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: About the proposed addition to Section 50 79.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1439.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Enforcement remedies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1440.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Penalties whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1444.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1447.403s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we should talk about the second section before we talk before we hear from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1452.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, yeah, uh, proposed amendments section 50 80 certain public private transactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1459.509s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Prohibited Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1707.162s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1708.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other councilor comments on this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2051.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a very valid point and something that we should consider including.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2063.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other any further comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1131.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm excited to get going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2241.001s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For the sake of clarity, also, it seems to me that the more we can be, the more our body and our state delegation can be on the same page and in agreement with each other, the better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2255.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The better position we would be probably to move it along quicker at the state level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2262.522s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2263.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to be super clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=808.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=809.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=814.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very eager to work on this ordinance and I think there are a lot of situations that can make our residents in Medford nervous about things happening at the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=833.564s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: even some things that are happening at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=835.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So when there are things that we can do at the local level to ensure the safety of our residents, I think we should absolutely take those steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=843.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is a great example of how we can do that in a way that may feel small, but to many people, I think it's not a small thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=855.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: some experience with family members who have live in different states and have had experiences where they've been trying to access medical care and have had experiences where ice has been called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=868.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This isn't in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=870.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is in Texas, and it's a very real situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=875.654s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The more that we can do to ensure our residents that they are not going to be subject to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=886.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that sort of danger when trying to access medical care, I think is really critical and our residents deserve that kind of assurance that they are safe in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=901.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you and I'm excited to get working on the specifics of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2570.201s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate all the comments we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2572.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have an incredibly prosaic note that there is a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2578.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Section 5083F employees is misspelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2583.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just noticed when I was reading through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2586.855s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2588.196s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's just an extra A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2592.778s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did also have some thoughts about the reporting requirements for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2597.381s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just curious about how easy or difficult that might be for the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2606.968s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's a non-participation, non-compliance, then it may be unnecessary to report out what they're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2617.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2619.471s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how that works, or if we can maybe, I'd be curious to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2626.995s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2628.415s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's whistleblower protection subject to the blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2630.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's the second line down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2631.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It says any city employees with an AS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2634.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2639.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Defined in section 185.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2640.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2683.186s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, maybe Councilor Tseng even did you draft it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2685.768s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2686.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2689.971s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, especially because just because it says every six months and especially if it's ah, I'm just I am curious about how we would have how their department would have records if it's something that's non participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2767.975s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2769.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The only reason I, I would just, I thought it was a very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2778.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the last speaker made about how when our police department is focusing on things that are not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2786.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Helping our residents, then it's taking time and energy away from helping our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2790.386s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So and I wouldn't want to ask our police department to be doing things that's outside of the realm of their responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2797.748s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I do realize like and we'll be talking about this tomorrow because we're making some edits to the C cups ordinance and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2804.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that reporting requirement is already, you know, something that's happening in that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2811.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And often it's like the report is there is no update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2815.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's fine, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2817.439s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's not, you know, a ridiculous ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2820.862s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure we weren't, you know, without realizing it, putting too much on the plates of different departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3648.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would say that when it seems like something is changing hands, but staying pretty much the same, it seems less interesting to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3661.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But when it's something that's like changing over, like, I mean, I was a huge Chili Garden fan, love Chili Garden, very sad that they are changing hands, but interested to see what Buns House turns out to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3673.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3676.142s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: people are very interested in the businesses that open up in Medford because it changes the kind of cultural landscape of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3681.906s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do think that we should be kind of exploring, I think that's a way that the work of city council really translates directly into people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3690.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we should be like, I think we should be including that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3695.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When it Yeah, but I think you're right, like case by case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3698.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In this case, I think we should include it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3901.329s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3901.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4062.808s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1212.093s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that was a very fun Thanksgiving game in the rain, and it was cold, and it was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1218.534s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They played, the team played so, so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1220.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1223.315s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm so happy to celebrate the team and gladly support that resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1230.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for putting it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1860.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1861.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think you can tell how much the City Council relishes an opportunity to talk about our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1868.474s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't get that many chances, but it's exciting when we have something to celebrate like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1873.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I do really agree and want to reiterate how important it is for students in our public schools to have opportunities to try different things, find the thing that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1886.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: they fit in with and that they can thrive in, whatever that thing is, if it's sports, if it's music, if it's art, if it's some seemingly random or counterintuitive activity that makes them really happy and makes them feel like they have a place, that's what makes kids thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1906.674s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the importance of these kinds of successes for our students can't be overstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1913.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm just very excited about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1915.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: these resolutions coming forward and these celebrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1919.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2101.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I found the records in order and I move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2626.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would just have some basic questions about if there are any changes planned to the building or the establishment, or if it's just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2637.556s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2639.376s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2982.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2984.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is an issue that was brought to my attention by some local concerned citizens who, in particular, we were talking about Route 16 close to the Whole Foods where the guardrail has been crashed into and replaced so many times that it has its own Instagram account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3008.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, it's, uh, it's while we were walking through that intersection, we witnessed at least two, at least two extremely illegal and dangerous traffic violations that we pointed to, and we were like, like that, like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3026.156s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just kept happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3027.757s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, people drive really fast on Route 16 in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3030.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and then, uh, as I was looking into it, I discovered what the other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3037.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that are controlled by state agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3041.403s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This causes a lot of complications when we try to increase the safety of our roadways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3047.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3050.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to make a couple of notes on this resolution after looking into it and discussing the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3056.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um a couple of these roadways are now under local<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3066.898s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we can if we can amend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3071.04s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or I'm not sure if we need to amend it really the the mass general law chapter 90 section 18 says that we can basically petition those agencies to change their sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3082.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So really, all we're doing is we're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3085.606s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: DCR, can you lower the speed limit of the roads that you control, mainly route 16 and 38 and 28, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3102.205s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: are up around 35 miles per hour is the limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3105.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And people do drive faster than that, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3107.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it's just like anything, we're not in charge of how people break the laws, we're only in charge of what the laws are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3112.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if we would like to move forward with it, we would say, we would ask these state agencies to change their, those roadways speed limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3123.792s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And what that does is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3128.527s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: lessens the likelihood that a crash would be a fatal crash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3133.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that is the hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3135.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is a small step, but it is hopefully something in the direction of greater safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3141.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I wanted to say thank you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3145.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Walk Medford, Ellery Klein of Walk Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3147.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a ton of support from the Medford Bike Commission, Emily O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3154.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had support from Patricia, Senator Patricia Jalen's office, Matt Hartman, her chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3160.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a big group of people that did this walking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3163.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of that intersection, but we talked a lot about there are a lot of really interested people and, um, traffic safety and just safety of human beings moving through the city is, of course, not I don't think it's very contentious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3176.319s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um so people do want to be safe where they live and work and travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3180.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is a this is something that I think can At least move in the direction of achieving that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3188.545s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3218.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: sorry, what I do wonder is if we would, if it would behoove us to ever take anything out of it, like we might as well just say anything that's state controlled, ask that the agency is lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3233.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3259.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3260.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Rather than eliminating some that are technically city-controlled, to maybe just say any and all state-controlled roads, we petition that they be lowered to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5292.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I can just briefly give you a moment of context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5295.378s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When I lived in Somerville, I rented and it was getting very expensive to rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5302.922s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My husband worked for a tech company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5304.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We sold stock to pay the down payment on a condo in Somerville because there was a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5312.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When we were paying our mortgage, we paid less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5315.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So when we were homeowners, because we had stock to sell, because we had enough money to buy property, we were able to pay less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5324.638s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sometimes residential exemption is what amounts to a handout to people with enough money to buy property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5333.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To put that into perspective, sometimes that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5338.564s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's what it was for me when I lived in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5344.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In this case, I think in Medford, the break even does not make sense at this point today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5351.025s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I feel that our conversation about it is losing some of the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5362.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When our residents voted for the override,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5366.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They were not voting to then turn around and exempt themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5370.707s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They voted to increase the property tax rate as they expected it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5377.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's what we're voting to enact tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5382.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=914.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=915.705s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I just had a question about capacity in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=918.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=921.754s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=923.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Will it require you to take on more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=925.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=928.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Since it's contracting out with housing families, which I've worked with them before too, they're really wonderful, Laura's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=935.221s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If they're handling this and it's their space in your budget for them to do the work, then maybe this is a moot point, but is there anything that you're going to have to be taking on that's going to be more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=945.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: complicated or difficult or is it good totally well within your capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1052.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Chair, if I may, just two thoughts I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1058.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One is that I just know that capacity can be limited in our city hall offices in Medford, so just something I'd love to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1069.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: keep in mind for for us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1072.67s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really important that we take advantage of programs like this they're really wonderful and it's a great way for us to reach out to folks who can benefit from our from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1083.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: programs that are available like this, but we should not be stretching our steps so thin that, you know, they can't operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1091.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that just means hiring and building our capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1095.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The second thing is, is there something built in for outreach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1099.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's possible that I've missed it, but just letting people know about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1102.664s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there a plan for letting qualified folks know about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1997.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do like the idea of tying it to the fee schedule, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2015.5s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2231.154s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are just a couple of, this may just be a holdover, but the Administration Finance Committee, Governance Committee just have like blank, a couple of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2280.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When we're ready, I'm happy to motion to move this to the regular committee or no, we don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2302.296s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Approve a contingent upon what is voted on in the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2357.384s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2357.945s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We I've been communicating with Pamela Kelly of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2366.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2367.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She has a title, elder services, director of elder services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2375.409s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we set up a time, consistent time to hold a listening session at the senior center in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2382.972s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm going to host that the first time, but we'll have a rotating, hopefully other Councilors can rotate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2389.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and we'll have it be a consistent, ongoing session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2393.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's gonna be Thursdays at noon once a month, starting in January at the end of January, January 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2400.14s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that should be a great opportunity to hear from our local seniors and make sure that folks are used to seeing city council members there at the senior center available to hear concerns and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2418.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: bring those concerns back to our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2420.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, as as we're able and looking forward to getting started with that, and we're gonna be able to put it in the senior center newsletter, so people will be aware of it leading up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2622.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will be with Councilor Callahan at the library on Saturday for the Arab American liaison listening session, but I can't be there on the 7th of December so I but I would also be fine with like seating that to another Councilor if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2639.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I could do the 4th, January 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2641.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, it's kind of like these sessions aren't meant to be too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2646.497s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Honestly, if there were three of us, there would be a quorum of this committee and we wouldn't be able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2650.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's sort of the conundrum, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2654.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would say probably December 7th would work for the West Medford Community Center if you wanted to do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2662.165s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2663.166s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2892.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that the library, though I mean we're already doing some targeted sessions at the library but it being a space that people with young kids before they go to school, meet frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2907.869s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: people, low income folks who don't have somewhere to hang out during the day will frequently go, especially when it's cold out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2916.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It tends to be a gathering space for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2919.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Lots of different groups in the community can be, if we had capacity similar to what we're doing at the senior center, to go consistently to the library in one of the rooms and we could advertise on a regular basis, that might be something that we could do similar to what we're doing at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2000.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to echo what Vice President Collins was saying about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2006.331s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanking director Blake for his work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2010.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I, the more blue bikes we are getting into the city, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2013.917s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just would encourage this council to continue to look at how we can increase the safety of biking infrastructure in the city as we, as we go into these kinds of processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1456.058s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Callahan bringing this forward with the intention of following your genuine hopes to put forward something that would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1473.288s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What the original suggestion here was, was that council would vote for a cola increase, which is a cost of living increase for a future if they wanted to for a future city council not for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1487.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It wouldn't take effect until the next two years, if it if it ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1491.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is what she intended, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1494.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1495.66s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Meaning you could never and that is true for some other cities, but it's part of their charters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1501.703s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this this wouldn't be something that we can put in as an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1505.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My understanding is you would have to do it as a charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1507.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's why it would be referred to governance, we could talk about it in the governance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1510.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's where we talk about charter changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1512.956s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think we need to discuss it in a regular meeting, we could talk about it in governance, and I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1519.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that voting publicly for cost of living increases for ourselves that people can witness and if they can, if they are upset about that and I think a 2% increase for a body that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1533.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: makes currently $29,000 a year, 30,000 maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1536.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you want to vote us out because of that increase, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1539.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's your right as voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1540.842s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1541.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we're doing it transparently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1543.003s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've decided to do it and you can vote us out if you don't like that we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1547.306s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because that's a democratic choice that you can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1550.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All of that being said, I think it's bad faith to see what was written and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1560.58s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: argue that Councilor Callahan was trying to say, we will like across the board, give ourselves insane increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1570.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that that is what this discussion is about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1572.647s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that's what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1573.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1575.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1577.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I, if we haven't, if we don't have a second on moving us to governance, then I would second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1581.953s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I think that we should move it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1310.956s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, this committee meeting was to discuss a number of items that have come up over the past sessions about gender-affirming care, reproductive health, and the possibility of gender-affirming care<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1331.072s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: public bathrooms in our parks in Medford and just the feasibility of all of these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1336.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was a preliminary meeting for us to discuss the possibility of addressing all of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1343.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we talked sort of broadly about how to begin the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1349.98s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.122s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2252.331s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All the activities are really well attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2256.233s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2260.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that parking is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2262.582s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2271.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: would still be part of the buildings that they put there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2274.757s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But Councilor Leming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2280.442s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2285.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2288.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2293.074s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I would be excited to do that more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2295.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2304.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6314.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6315.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, when we talk about increasing property taxes and our prep two and a half override questions we also discuss new growth frequently because that's another mechanism for increasing revenue to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6331.182s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this will be a wonderful opportunity to increase revenue coming into Medford without asking our residents to pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6342.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That will contribute to the services that we can provide our residents, and this is the way we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6348.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so grateful to Vice President Collins and the rest of the Planning and Permitting Committee for all of their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6355.194s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6356.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: watching the meetings lately, and it's just taken a ton of commitment and a lot of very careful, thoughtful planning and design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6366.983s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and a lot of great collaboration with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6370.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm looking forward to seeing where we go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6374.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this is new growth on Mystic Ebb has the potential to pay for things like keeping the library open on Sundays, like smaller projects that we couldn't possibly justify with larger things like an override because they're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6389.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that we can't afford to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6391.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um uh, things that are too too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6392.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are too many things we need to pay for that we can't afford yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6395.527s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the way that we bring in that revenue without asking our residents to scrimp and save and give us more is by giving our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6409.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we want to be able to provide the services that our residents need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6413.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also did just want to address briefly that I know that our City Hall employees are attempting in many ways to address a lot of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6425.558s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: public feedback that they do need for things like car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6430.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I work out in car park a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6432.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't live near car park, but a lot of my friends do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6435.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I was approached by a city hall employee in car park when I was exercising once to ask me to weigh in on phase two of car park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What do I need to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6445.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did an online form that I was given, like, what do you want in car park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6450.634s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there were, there was, I experienced some outreach about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6455.512s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's hard to reach everybody, but I think that there are a lot of avenues that City Hall employees in the planning department are attempting to achieve and we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6467.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I know it can be tough, but it's, they're doing it, they're trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6471.917s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3259.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I can say about grants that you can apply for through the EPA and other grant making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3267.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: companies, opportunities, foundations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3270.052s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can't fund a city, you can't operate a budget for a city of our size on grants alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3279.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It just wouldn't be enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3280.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there are opportunities for things like that, and it is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3284.359s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can definitely say that Alicia Klein and other department heads are utilizing every opportunity that they come across and they are aware of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3296.042s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've spoken with Tim McKibben as well about a number of opportunities that they are aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3301.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it is something that's being utilized when it's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4071.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just one thing I want to add, there's a lot of things at the city level where we have to vote as a city council to authorize funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4082.213s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that the money is immediately spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4084.754s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It means that we are authorizing funds to let somebody move forward with a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4095.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: start a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4096.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mean that you're writing a check that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4098.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This sort of reminds me of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4100.667s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You're authorizing us to take out a bond as the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4105.615s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So as things move and change, that process continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=734.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to keep the paper in committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=740.336s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: keep paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=893.443s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Am I, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=894.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yep, you're recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=895.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know why I'm called on with the new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=896.465s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=898.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to, via email through the clerk, I had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=905.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: mentioned something about the links being embedded for neatness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=911.865s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was told that all the links would be embedded, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=916.73s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I have already reviewed the sections on the committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=921.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They look good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=922.596s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1050.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I like the suggested edit a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1053.113s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1139.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We passed Sarah Bradley Fulton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1140.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We tabled the commemoration of the DPW workers that will be discussed, I believe, at the next October meeting on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1152.197s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just because it was so late and we didn't want to give it short shrift, but Sarah Bradley Fulton was coming up that next weekend, so we needed to make sure it was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1512.908s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=155.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is Medford City Council, Public Health and Community Safety Committee, October 16th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=165.001s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are meeting today to discuss a couple of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=171.465s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=174.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=190.317s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=191.118s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Four present, one absent, meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=194.899s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We will be discussing two items today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=197.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The first is 22-379 offered by Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, Resolution of Draft and Ordinance to Secure Rights to Gender Affirming Care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=211.631s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that will be actually in conjunction with 22-453, which is a former item offered by President Bears, Vice President Collins, and former Councilor Morell, resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=229.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So these are two items that I will ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=237.509s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng to summarize for us and then we can get started discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=242.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have also a draft that Councilor Tseng shared with the committee today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=250.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=600.037s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=601.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe we still need a response from a police chief Buckley and the board of health director, Brian O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=613.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to reach out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=616.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if we need a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=618.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=620.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I can't make that motion anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.143s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=625.903s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=627.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I was just skimming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=630.126s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure where in the language, if there is anything in the language that sort of mentions the anti-abortion clinics, or if we have the capacity to put something like that in an ordinance that would prevent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=646.254s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a facility like that from opening, or if we would be able to do something like that, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=691.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It may be something that we want to, when we go line by line on an individual basis and then come back and talk about it, it might be worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=699.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: looking at, it might just be something I haven't had a chance yet to go through with a fine tooth comb, which is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=708.775s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think it might be something that we may have to ask legal about our capacity for what we would be able to, what we can say to a business that wants to come in and what we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=725.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But anyway, I think this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=729.983s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree that sending feedback with another meeting and maybe scheduling another meeting that would be probably next month and see if we can get some more solid plans in place at that point would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=744.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=747.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments from, or do you have more that you want to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=764.748s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=765.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any further comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=769.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=772.413s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion Councilor Tseng mentioned was that councilors send feedback to myself and CC Councilor Tseng before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=785.641s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=788.87s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=791.511s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor, oh, we lost Councilor, oh, there they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=797.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'll just hold on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=806.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, there was traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=807.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=808.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=832.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I will withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=834.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And so just to update the councilors that just arrived, we have been talking about the drafted language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=843.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you have the language from Councilor Tseng or have you, you may not have had a chance to look it over because it was really fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=857.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's some, we have some up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=891.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=893.558s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng has been going over a summary of where we're at with the ordinances about gender affirming care and reproductive health care in Medford, including non-cooperation of police if there's any outside of Massachusetts entity trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=917.29s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: enforce laws that are not applicable in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=921.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any anti-abortion clinics that may be trying to open in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=926.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What would be our capacity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=928.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed what would be our capacity as a city council to attempt to prevent or enact a rule against a predatory<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=943.851s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: business like that opening, and these are, we're just at a discussion stage at this point, but Councilor Tseng did distribute some language that would be the motion on the floor at the moment is from Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming for the members of the committee to review the language as written now, including a couple of sentences that Councilor Tseng will add in about the anti-abortion clinics<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=972.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that are not currently in here, but he will add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=975.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if you can review the language and send thoughts or edits to myself and see what the councilors are saying before our next meeting, then we can keep moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=987.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it's not, we're not at the stage yet of obviously a line by line review of the ordinance as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=995.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1010.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1011.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That would be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1013.904s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1014.564s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Please do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1019.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1025.02s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will also reach out to the Director of the Board of Health and the Chief of Police for their feedback on the language thus far, because we haven't heard from them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1038.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is two papers that were in the past two sessions or past session that we're reviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1051.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So now you're all up to speed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1053.855s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any comments from, yes, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1138.304s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1139.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1140.178s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1143.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1145.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1147.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1150.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The next item for tonight is item 24- Oh, just quickly on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1233.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The question was, would the committee be interested in taking up a paper on ensuring access to enshrining in an ordinance something of pharmacy compliance with maintaining access to emergency contraception?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1251.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1252.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1255.396s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would that include like Misoprostol, Mifepristone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1259.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1260.821s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1261.702s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1262.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that would be like abortion pills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1263.904s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.306s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1265.526s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1308.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up, which is not a spur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1312.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I see a thumbs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1316.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like there's some interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1318.859s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I mean, I am interested in it from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1321.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, there's like a less of a, I don't know, I can't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1324.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a little bit more casual from the chair of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1328.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I mean, I would be interested in doing something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1332.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about, I am still curious about like what our capacity is as a city to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1341.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What our capacity is as a city to do anything that wouldn't be already in trend in state law, but I do also think that there is value in affirming something that is right and correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1354.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So yeah, I would be in favor of discussing it for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1357.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think to that end, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1360.598s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1380.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think so, especially because at a local level, like we have many pharmacies in town, that would be a very localized thing to do, so that makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1404.916s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be something that you would need to present a paper to the regular committee to then have it reviewed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1413.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The 22-453 resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1419.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1420.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It absolutely falls under that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1426.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng to draft language for an ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the state executive order on emergency contraception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1451.456s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1453.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1454.577s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1455.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1456.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1457.398s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1461.46s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are we ready to jump to the next paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1466.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1467.123s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 24-470, offered by Justin Tseng, City Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1470.725s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Resolution to discuss the installation of sanitary facilities in public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1477.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee meet to consider potential ordinances, policies, and regulations to strengthen the protection<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1486.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, no, that's the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1488.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1490.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1493.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Discuss the possibility of installing sanitary facilities and public spaces, including in our parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1498.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1542.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that one of the first things we'll have to consider is the cost and where, how to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1555.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Where do we begin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1559.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1564.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1650.71s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would suggest the Medford Family Network would be a good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1653.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1654.691s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know they even have playgroups in the park, and they go to different parks, and probably they, Miss Andrea, I think, leads those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1666.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can't remember her last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1668.241s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm sure they'll have some feedback about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1672.845s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But for sure, probably Medford Family Network, Frances Nwaje, good starting points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1683.581s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Disabilities Commission, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1686.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins, are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1687.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is your hand up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1818.97s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, I would be curious to hear from, uh, Director Hunt from the planning and permitting, or planning, uh, no, that's the committee, planning department, planning sustainability department, and, um, Director McGivern from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1836.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: DPW or DPW as well, because just of their awareness, their institutional knowledge of the city and this is deceptively a large undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1852.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's the sort of thing that seems like it would be simple and is actually a huge, a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1856.859s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But again, I think Vice President Collins had it hit the nail on the head that it's just because something's hard or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1865.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: feels overwhelming in the moment doesn't mean you shouldn't start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1869.47s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it still needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1873.233s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's just a fundamental human thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1878.937s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we need to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1881.76s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So basically we have to talk to every department head in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1886.824s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have to spend a lot of money probably, but I think it will be, I think there are ways to do it that are more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1895.023s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: efficient and reasonable and if we take our time and do it right then it'll make more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1900.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1940.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is this like a cost-benefit analysis kind of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2016.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2079.23s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so, as, as, so, so, Councilor Lemings motion, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2087.702s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: city staff rather than specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2099.13s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2119.321s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2173.968s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2174.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2216.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2218.772s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2295.2s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2391.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2393.518s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2407.847s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Wilworth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2437.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for coming and speaking on behalf of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2440.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We appreciate you taking the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2445.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do, another thing to note is that I've observed that some parks have port-a-potties at them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2453.679s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure who pays for them, why they're there at some times of the year and other times they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2458.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It must be some privately funded, maybe it's an organization like Medford Youth Soccer, maybe it's the softball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2464.526s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it's probably different times of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2467.227s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: privately funded, but it's inequitable because it's at different places, and then you have access to it sometimes, and then sometimes you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2476.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So just something to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2481.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many parts of the city are privatized right now, and if there's an opportunity for us to explore ways that we can give access to folks in the city publicly, then maybe we should explore that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2547.204s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right, pennies on the dollar compared to what it would cost one organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2553.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2559.707s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2560.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2561.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other motions for this paper before... Any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2570.494s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2587.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=472.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't know Larry for very long, but I really appreciated that he, what I did know of him was that he was really fun and he was really kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=485.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he was really nice to my kids when he dropped off packets at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=491.024s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if I can be remembered that way, I would consider myself very lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=497.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He had my back literally and figuratively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=500.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was really nice having him behind me when he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=502.997s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I had a kind of a tough time at a few meetings in the beginning of my tenure here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=508.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he was very steady in presence, really, really, really nice about stuff and really kind to me and funny and cheerful and steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=520.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=523.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I hope he and I hope he rests in peace and I hope his family finds comfort and how well loved he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=120.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2195.993s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that I wanna mention about to answer the Zoom question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2202.814s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of residents question, Michelle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2206.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2220.875s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2232.303s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2239.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2242.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2244.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2249.756s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2257.722s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2265.027s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2268.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This has been happening for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2270.071s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have had underfunded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2271.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: schools for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2273.073s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2274.694s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2277.435s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5917.923s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are, I would paraphrase Councilor Leming and say that we aren't all even asking for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5926.588s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are giving the voters of Medford the opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5931.724s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: raise their own taxes if they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.027s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5934.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You're allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5935.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5936.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're here to answer questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5941.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: not to convince anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5943.358s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're just telling you what we know and what we have the luxury of knowing from having this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5950.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I will say is that historic underfunding has led to, and having never passed an override before, has led to such scenarios as me receiving an email that there is lead in the water at the Brooks Elementary School where my kids go because of fixtures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5970.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in the building in a school that was built after the year 2000 because corners were cut because money was tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5978.315s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They were trying to save money when they built the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5980.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's what happens when you don't fund your city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5984.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we can keep trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5987.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can keep trying to not fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5990.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's a choice that the voters have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5992.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And everybody, that's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5995.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we all have the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5997.292s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody has the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5998.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we're here to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6000.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're not trying to say you're good or you're bad or you're doing whatever, but I really hope, I hope that we are making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6011.439s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They might be hard decisions, but we're making decisions that are taking care of each other, that are prioritizing the people that we care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6021.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: understanding the fiscal responsibility that we have towards each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7300.319s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would offer that another Councilor might be better equipped to answer the question about the way that debt exclusions are structured legally, the ramifications of how you estimate the dollar amount that it's going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7313.766s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I will say that the firehouse is a property of the city, which means it's owned by the residents of Medford, not the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7324.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So even if the union is not in agreement with the mayor, the property is owned by the city and if it's not in good working order and we need to maintain the building, it's important that the building be maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8039.024s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I used to work for the superintendent of schools, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8046.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've never worked for somebody who has had so much integrity and led from such a place of integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8052.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that she, when she answered Councilor Scarpelli, who I think asked her that question a number of times over and over again, in order to try to get her to say something off or make a mistake, but she was trying to not lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8073.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And what she doesn't wanna do is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8076.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: be caught up in having to make a decision that doesn't put the best scenario for the students first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8086.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So my guess is that that was where that was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8092.045s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Also, that things shift in schools all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8094.608s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: People leave districts for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8096.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you can't reinforce or if you can't reappoint somebody to something because they got another job, these things happen all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8103.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can't always put somebody back in a position because they've gotten another position somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8108.521s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not always possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8110.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that was, I think she was trying to be truthful to the best of her ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8114.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing I will say is I'm sorry to have hurt anybody's feelings, but I really did not appreciate getting an email saying that the fixtures inside the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8124.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: cause there to be lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8125.926s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am not saying it as it was somebody else's fault, but my kids go to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8131.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8134.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10574.17s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10577.873s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I actually know a lot of people who have kids with learning disabilities in the schools that struggle similarly, and I know it's a big hill to overcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10591.192s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and it's a lot to grapple with and it's really frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10594.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know we have a lot of work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10596.976s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I also think this is a school committee question and it's not something that we on city council grapple with very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10603.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that we're equipped to answer it fully, but I feel for you and it's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10614.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would recommend bringing it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10617.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to school committee asking if you could get something like that on the agenda or speaking to the school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10622.981s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know it can be super, super frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10625.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have friends with advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10626.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10627.603s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10628.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really unequitable because if you have money, you can hire somebody to either be a tutor or get an advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10636.286s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10637.847s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a bad system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10639.448s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Literacy is so complicated and difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10641.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm really sorry you're going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11255.542s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I, I, I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11257.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are you saying that we shouldn't be accepting English language learners into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11265.939s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11266.76s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're not going to do back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11269.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11270.503s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're asking questions about the overage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11271.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're not talking about how English language learners are expensive for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11276.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a public school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11278.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is not something that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11279.729s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12582.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was me, but I was just gonna mention Councilor Leming's linkage fees, which he mentioned, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13094.83s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13323.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm currently serving on the committee that is working on the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13329.331s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when the MSBA is going to ask us to request a debt exclusion for the new high school, that's gonna be significantly more expensive than what the firehouse will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13349.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that we will be able to come back and ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13353.063s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: for another debt exclusion for a firehouse at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13357.825s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it will take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13359.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that there's a possibility that there could be an approved fire station between the two parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13368.469s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Once this debt exclusion, if it is approved, then I think the money will be available and a satisfactory firehouse can be built, or there's the opportunity for it to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13381.383s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think time is of the essence because of the limited nature of the timeline, given that we have an urgency of the high school coming down the pike as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13392.292s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a lot of people in town vying for very large projects heading our direction, and I think we have to balance a lot of people's needs all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13407.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=820.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Could you go to the next steps slide again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=828.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the Charter Study Commission wants to release their final report soon, which is sooner than they anticipated it being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=837.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It had initially said December, but it's only October, which is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=842.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the mayor is hoping to review it first and then give her response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=855.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess being that it's that they're going to come out with their response so soon, maybe I would suggest that we would see what they're thinking as compare it with what we have for a generic idea of things and kind of go from there would be my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=879.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They've been spending a lot of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=881.44s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And a lot of having a lot of meetings and doing a lot of public participation, it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=888.363s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm eager to see where they've gone with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=892.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I know that there's a lot to take into consideration with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=901.669s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=903.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's really helpful to have it all laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1489.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just, is there a way that, I was just looking, trying to look through the documents just now that the committee posted and I couldn't find the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1500.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, it's not released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1504.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But you have the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1508.166s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I was looking at the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1510.769s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And so the committee has really put a lot of like, they voted on every, every recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1517.054s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So every single decision was a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1519.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it does cover a lot of ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=325.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=333.897s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: October 8th, 2024, 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=338.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=339.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=344.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Absolute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=345.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=353.066s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=356.904s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present, five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=358.805s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=360.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The meeting is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=362.926s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are discussing two items, which we've discussed at a previous meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=368.067s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 24-036 offered by Vice President Kit Collins, resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance, as well as 24-461, also offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=386.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These are two items that are joined together because they affect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=391.425s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And today we will be talking about the, well, I'll let Vice President Collins discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=399.653s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're going to go over the language that's been shared with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=404.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=667.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any comments from, oh, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=683.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=686.918s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=687.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other questions or comments from councilors before I turn it over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=692.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=694.304s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, I would love to hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=763.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=765.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do have a small question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=772.358s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do appreciate the suggestion of DCR possibly or in some professional capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=781.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know personally what constitutes standing water, for instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=789.235s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that a birdbath?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=790.556s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that a man-made pond?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=793.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do like man-made water feature kind of yard situations require some level of movement of water?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=807.003s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=807.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That articulates my kind of lay person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=887.753s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=888.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=892.917s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess it probably when we go when we do legal review of this document, though, there'll be like a professional understanding of kind of which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=907.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: maybe, I guess my only thought about this is that like there's a level of expertise that we don't necessarily have as a council on some of this stuff, but that somebody will and we'll be referring it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=923.489s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=925.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=938.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think that would be advisable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=962.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=964.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the timeline here is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=969.281s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: These documents get reviewed, then it's reviewed by legal once we approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=974.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry, could you say that last part again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=978.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Once we would approve this, it would get reviewed by legal after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1021.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1024.652s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I thought that the, I had no feedback besides the standing order question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1030.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there, Councilor Callahan just stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1033.955s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other thoughts or comments by Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1042.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Vice President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1167.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1168.357s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any public participation comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1174.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none in the audience, anybody on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1178.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1179.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none, I on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1185.981s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1217.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1221.643s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The clerk just clarified that the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, is to clarify definitions in the ordinances and then pass the ordinances on to legal for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1243.556s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had to add a definition for standing water also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1245.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And to add a definition for standing water will be an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1248.339s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'll say clarify definitions also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1249.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clarify definitions, yes, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1253.976s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, and once you have that written out, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1271.09s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1271.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1273.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1277.916s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins for bringing this forward and for your work on these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1282.29s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not very glamorous, but it is very necessary, and it's going to move forward in a way that is timely and useful for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1289.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1292.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor as well for your work on this and for bringing it to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1299.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other motions, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1366.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I would favor a summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1368.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other preferences?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1374.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It seems like a summary is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1659.403s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, is there anything you'd like to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1947.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The current fee schedule is not, it's kind of a proposed new amount section as you're waiting on legal to help fill that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1970.803s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1973.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1974.665s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you repeat the motion for me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1978.087s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, you got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1979.307s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2063.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I especially appreciate updating this with the new rules about composting and seeing all the compost bins around town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2070.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: with their beautiful locking lids that everybody should use and love because they're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2079.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have another item to discuss or another motion perhaps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2089.761s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, on Vice President Collins' motion seconded by Councilor Leming, let's say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2116.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=493.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am curious if you know how long these pieces of equipment last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=631.694s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a question generally for how we do these appropriations, is are we approving the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=640.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: amount that they're authorized to offer, or is this the amount that it will cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=646.593s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, is this real numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=649.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This may be different for each of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=657.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is based on the estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=658.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not like writing a check right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=660.675s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Some of this money may remain in the account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=758.558s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm sorry about all these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=761.461s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does this imply further issues like this because all the elementary schools were built at the same time and everything would presumably be failing at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=895.733s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My main concern in asking that was about the upgrades to the electrical systems and sort of more broad-based issues that might start coming up, and if there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=904.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: probably this is already something that's on your radar if that's something that you've been talking about just prior to piece by piece these things start to fail and then we have to go back and look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=917.656s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: electrical system updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=939.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I may, I'm glad to hear that there's sort of a comprehensive plan in place that you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=946.061s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: looking at and thinking about these systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=947.522s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=949.043s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=62.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=124.614s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=125.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So per the Medford Bike Commission, I wanted to hold this committee meeting and give them an opportunity to have a public discussion about this intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=138.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Unfortunately, our representative from MassDOT was not available to meet, but he did send an email that I'd like to read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=147.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=149.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I believe that they'll be able to have another meeting there early in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=154.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was important for us to make sure that we were able to get these notes on the record from the bike commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=163.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're like 25% planning, and they do sort of public feedback, they factor in the feedback, they go back to planning, they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=174.54s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: do another sort of public meeting session, and then they do the next phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=180.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Greg Fraser is the project manager for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=186.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To give some context, this is the intersection of Main Street and Route 16 as it goes sort of under the bridge where Route 16 goes over Main Street by the Mystic River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=201.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=203.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: well-traveled intersection, and it's also pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=207.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's right by the, well, it's not like, it has potential to be problematic, let's say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=217.587s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's right across from the Medford Police Department headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=221.49s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have a fire station there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=222.651s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have many medical offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=224.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have lots of businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=226.995s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's heavily traveled, and it's an intersection of many different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=233.211s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: modes of transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=234.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, the message that I got from Greg Frazier was, um, sorry for a master.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=241.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=242.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Project manager for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=244.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He said, I have sent the 25% submission to Todd Blake, who is our, as we know, our, um, city, uh, our what's Todd's title.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=255.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Todd's here on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=256.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He can tell me his title.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=257.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He'll speak in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=257.808s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and I've sent out a scheduling poll to meet with the city of Medford bike advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=263.345s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: MassDOT highway design complete streets Todd Blake and the consultant Howard Stein Hudson to discuss the design further as agreed upon following the public informational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=272.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting will allow further discussions now that the design team has had an opportunity to further investigate the design following written comments received from the committee as well as other constituents following the public informational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=286.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: With<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=287.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: further discussions as at the upcoming meeting, the design team will only have more opportunity to further look into design prior to going to a design public hearing and then continuing further in design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=298.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that that's his statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=300.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's I, my understanding is there's intention to have this be a really fluid process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=306.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're not going to break ground for quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=308.538s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so I found that encouraging, but I will go, uh, if I may to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=318.064s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh, Emily O'Brien, who is here on Zoom, uh, if that's through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=323.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, she's the, uh, president of our president of our Medford bike commission, and she and I met and spoke at length about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=333.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, um, she outlined the thoughts and, um, concerns that the bike commission had with the plans as they were at the earliest stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=342.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, I would love to hear her, um, perspective on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=348.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=977.722s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=979.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a few things that I want to highlight in what Emily said, which are that efficiency of cyclists is not just a matter of cyclists getting to work on time, but it's also the fact that we want to make our streets<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1003.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we want to make it easy to follow the laws of our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1006.693s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we make it too difficult to follow the laws, then it just becomes more logical for people to break the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1014.959s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then cyclists are like anybody and they would just go around it and it becomes a dangerous situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1023.666s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And sometimes when you're on a bike, I can speak for myself because I ride a bike sometimes, but I get scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1030.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of something that could happen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1031.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I have to go too slow, it's more likely that I'll wobble, lose my balance and have to step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1037.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then if I step down in the middle of the street, I become, it becomes very dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1043.516s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My daughter learned how to ride her bike recently and now she wants to ride her bike everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1046.898s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She's seven years old and she's often like really wobbly and she wants to ride her bike to CVS to buy candy all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1053.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm afraid to ride to the CVS on High Street because there's nowhere to ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1057.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like cars packed real tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1061.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's on the way to, you know, this connection here with, you know, 16 and Main Street and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1067.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we had to slow down too much, it would be scary and wobbly and, you know, it's easier to ride on the sidewalk, but when people are walking their dogs, it's not a safe space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1078.332s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I wanted to mention is there was a deadly accident recently in Cambridge where it was a shared space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1086.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not the same situation, but it was on Memorial Drive, I believe, and it was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1095.297s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a bike path that merges into a sidewalk and they become a shared space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1100.159s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And people have been talking for a long time about how dangerous it is and something that had been on the radar of people wanting to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1109.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But we don't want to increase the opportunity for fatalities to happen, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1115.864s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So all of that being said, I know that we sometimes these kinds of meetings can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1123.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: move forward things that are maybe going to happen anyway but you know can increase the urgency so now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1140.936s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the bike commission will have a meeting with MassDOT that is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1144.997s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe some of this doesn't need to be as pressing that we discuss it right now, but I do, I would offer director Blake, if you have any, any response or anything you would want to add to the discussion that might be something that we wouldn't have thought of necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1162.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would, I would love to hear from you if you have anything that you'd like to add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1213.694s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's very encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1216.495s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1219.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1219.896s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I am happy to hear that the meetings are going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1225.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm comfortable with how this is moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1260.72s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I think that it would have something to do with the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1265.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They have a very specific, I think there's a specific route that they have to take based on, sorry, the... Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1278.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1279.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1715.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was just gonna motion to adjourn when you are finished with your thankings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=189.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=190.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We held a discussion of two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=195.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=198.58s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was a new ordinance 24-036.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=203.042s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We discussed that in conjunction with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=209.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=213.551s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's 24-461.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=215.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We talked about these two ordinances together because it was like a way to have a kind of a comprehensive view of managing the rodent situation in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=228.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Kind of goes hand in hand with what we've been discussing with a wildlife feeding ordinance in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=233.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And both papers are staying in committee and Vice President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=239.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Collins will be drafting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=240.822s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um those ordinances and then bringing them to the committee again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=245.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=466.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I saw somebody in the building he was looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=471.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He showed me on his phone that he was looking for the space to talk about this, but I don't see him here, but I think he may be in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=682.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=683.281s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our city participates in the pilot program with Tufts University, which is an agreement where Tufts pays a portion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=699.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Instead of taxes, it pays fees to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=703.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that do not equal the amount of money that they would pay were they to pay property taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=709.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But there is an exchange of services, significant services offered by Tufts and significant services offered by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=720.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I learned recently that Tufts decided to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=725.962s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: take a pause on their Neighborhood Fellows Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=728.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One of the participants this year is Chelli Keshavan, who is a very active community member in Medford, who brought it to my attention and asked that we ask Tufts, or a representative from Tufts to come and speak to us and explain the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=748.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nobody from Tufts was available tonight, but I do have a statement from Brock Roderico, who is the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=756.383s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: government and community relations executive director at Tufts University, which I'm going to read the email he sent me sort of explaining the agreement with Tufts that we enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=769.556s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He said, as we discussed, Tufts University provides many payments programs and services to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=775.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The neighborhood fellows program is not one of those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=778.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is open to applicants, regardless of where they live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=781.723s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This program is not part of the pilot agreement or the community benefits report that we provide to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=787.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Most participants do not live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=789.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Tufts University pays $1,426,148 in property taxes each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=796.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In addition, this is for buildings that are like housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=801.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In addition to those property tax payments, we also make an annual payment in lieu of taxes pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=806.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in the amount of $450,000 to the city of Medford, and we report all our community benefits to our Medford-Somerville Community Benefits Report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=814.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Those benefits come to more than $6 million each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=817.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A copy of the report can be found on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=819.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We did share that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=822.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For the Joyce Cummings Center on College Avenue, Tufts University pays an annual pilot payment of $250,000 each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=829.244s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Starbucks in the JCC also generates property tax revenue for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=835.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I did also want to invite some folks from the Neighborhood Fellows Program to speak on the program and what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=848.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When I spoke with Rocco, he did say that the plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=854.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: as of now, was for them to pause enrollment in the program temporarily, allow the folks that are enrolled right now to finish the program, and then reassess how acceptances would work going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=869.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have had meetings with current and former participants in the program, which it's a very interesting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=875.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's how it works right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=879.014s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is that people are accepted into the program as mid-career, like active community organizers, people who are change makers, who kind of come in and get a master's in public policy through Tufts University while they're actively leading in their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=902.604s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Most people are from the Boston area, Chelli is from Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=907.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But people are from Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, all around the region, Lawrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=914.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But there are people who are actively leading in their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=918.773s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very diverse program in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=922.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's something that may be discontinued, maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=926.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's unclear right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=928.336s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's sort of in flux.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=929.517s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But members of the program who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=934.161s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: part of the program right now and former members of the program, but alumni of the program, were interested in, I think that by the nature of who they are, because they're community activists, are trying to talk about ways to continue the program, keep it alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=951.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I thought it was especially prudent that we discuss it because it's a program that cultivates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=960.85s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: stronger and better leadership in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=964.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And even if it is not officially listed as part of the community benefits that Medford gets from the pilot program, I do think it is a valuable program for our community and our surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=979.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but I would, I would, uh, offer that, uh, if there is somebody from the program, it would be nice to hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1288.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1288.846s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would make the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1329.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will say the, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1332.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1335.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The link that was shared has some fairly robust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1343.675s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: estimates and it's available on the Tufts website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1345.976s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would encourage folks to take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1349.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a PDF called 2023 Tufts University Community Benefits Report for the cities of Medford and Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1356.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a PDF that maybe we can share as part of the minutes or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1363.362s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it is, it's a yearly report that I believe Tufts puts out that is the sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1372.054s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: accounting of their estimation of like the exchange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1378.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's fair to say it's like a guess of what that monetary value would be, but it's things like, well, one thing is undergraduate financial aid for students who are from Somerville and Medford, which I think I would argue they would probably give to those students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1398.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In any way, I used to work in financial aid at universities and it was common practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1404.555s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you accepted a student, they had to earn that place at the university by being academically viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1411.74s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was in the interest of the university to make it possible for the student to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1416.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So like, I'm not sure that's something that you would necessarily say, but all of these things like there is a monetary value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1422.128s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1425.014s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I think those are valid questions and I would motion to include them as a amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1435.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1500.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He, not no, in sort of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1508.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's, I would speak more, I wouldn't feel comfortable speaking on that because it's not really my, it's not up to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2033.772s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure that we need to discuss it on committee further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2036.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that we could have further conversations with Mr. Jurico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2040.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He's our government liaison at the university, and we often have really great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2048.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He's a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2050.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He's very responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2051.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He's a good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2052.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think we could handle this without it going to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2055.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So just motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3192.847s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm also in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3193.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3196.568s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have been to the Senior Center for a Listening Session with Councilor Leming before, and we had a great experience there, though it was a small turnout, but small and mighty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3209.471s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a great conversation, but my hesitation with the wording of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3217.067s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: resolution is that if we are to if we're going to do a committee of the whole, I think it would probably just be open to the public, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3224.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So anybody who has any questions, it could be any group of people that is curious or has, you know, a particular interest in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3235.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, um, and as such, I would encourage anybody who isn't sure about what these questions mean, to attend or come on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3246.693s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: listen and ask the questions that they would like answers to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3251.156s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would also be curious about if the school committee members who would be able to speak to the specifics of some of the school related questions might be able to participate or if they would do maybe hold their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3264.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure how that would, we wouldn't be able to do it at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=318.229s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know we're casual in the committee meetings, but, um, the, uh, one comment about the public health and community safety committee, um, the, I appreciate the ordinance will allow the city to step in if and only if there's a problem that neighbors are complaining about, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=338.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For example, it specifically allows people to have bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=341.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure, so, and maybe I'm too close to this discussion since I was leading all of the meetings and I feel like the wildlife feeding ordinance is something that, because I discussed it at great length, I feel like I would want to say more than this, but I don't want the newsletter to be overrun with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=366.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: our back and forth discussions of the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance, but I think I would wanna say the purpose of the ordinance is to avoid, I think we can be more direct about what it was about, which was that it was like, in that committee, we drafted and thoroughly discussed the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=395.916s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, which, you know, can you just tell me verbatim what, uh, yeah, I think I'm just thinking about like what, what it should say, and I'm not ready for it to be verbatim just yet, but I'd like to hear sort of your thoughts as I say them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=408.406s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think I would just want to say that the point of it was to, um, make sure that folks are not feeding wild animals intentionally aside from birds using bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=422.898s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think you can say that in one sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=428.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it would be something that you could, what's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=437.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something that you could enforce, that's the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=441.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This ordinance would be something that you could enforce only if there are complaints about a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=449.393s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something that would be enforced only if there were complaints about a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=455.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I'm just I'm trying to simplify and be like a little bit more specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=474.688s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=478.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.569s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=480.869s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think we can cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=482.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think you can cut from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=488.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then I think you can say it allows people to have bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=546.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would fully concur with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=564.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The overgrowth ordinance, we just are beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=567.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, we did begin discussing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=569.965s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, and that was this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=571.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Wait, did we begin discussing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=573.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=575.248s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Did we refer it to committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=576.569s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm all turned around now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=579.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, we did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=582.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We did discuss that this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=584.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=585.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Overgrowth, and that's also rodent related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=603.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, so on that note, yeah, we can add in the overgrowth in that case because we did just talk about that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=613.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that really encompasses how much intentionality there is in that committee and in the council overall in the partnership with the Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=692.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then begin the discussion of overgrowth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=695.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=698.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The agenda's there, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=700.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Make doubly sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=704.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It does begin to blend together sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=711.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think in that meeting we had two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=722.489s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, it was an update to the rodent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=725.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we had, right, because the wildlife feeding had already been approved and it was in first reading at the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=734.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this was two additional ordinances that we were addressing to further hone the rodent control measures in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=743.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe we have two bullet points under public health and community safety and they're all rodent related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=902.172s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's more like... And we don't have to spend forever on this, but... Maybe we can take that whole thing out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=914.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe we don't need an intentionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=917.093s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, we did, we put the purpose at the top, so we can, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=921.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I think that's enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1948.975s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I think what Councilor Tseng was suggesting is you could almost say passing resolutions, ordinances, and zoning regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1957.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That could be the first bullet, and then you could define all of those at the bottom in a little quick way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1964.326s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do want to say, I kind of like that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1967.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do want to say generally, and I was kind of alluding to this before the meeting began, but you all weren't privy to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1973.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was, I think the way we have to think about the way that we're communicating with the public via this committee and as individuals, and just because we're a thousand blossoms blooming in the city, everybody takes in information in such a wide variety of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1994.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To me, this would be absolutely, I would be completely unable to comprehend this piece of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2002.261s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand what it is now because I've done this work, but because of the way my brain operates and because of how quickly my eyes would gloss over looking at it, I think it's really useful for somebody who finds it really interesting and can process information without being actively involved in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2024.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think if we print it out and laminate it and put it on the walls, it'll be useful for the sort of people that are interested in receiving information in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2031.455s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the way that we think about it should be like giving information in a wide variety of different ways to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2039.882s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I'm sort of, as a courtesy to everybody,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2044.798s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: have to remove myself from having this conversation because I'm like, I don't understand who would ever receive information in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2050.581s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know somebody does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2052.362s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I am not that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2054.303s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would need it to be like, on a bulletin board at like a children's section of a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2060.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like big words and like, what's an ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2063.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like a worm explains it to me as it crawls out of an apple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2066.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, it's so confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2068.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Robert's rules took me a long time to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2071.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's true for a lot of people, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2074.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this stuff is all super true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2076.015s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I couldn't believe you fit it all in a piece of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2078.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2080.598s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it is, like, very applicable to the work that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2084.48s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I kind of think that, like, this being, like, the most critical, most useful stuff that comes up every single time, almost, is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2094.071s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And for the people that it's going to work for, it's going to work really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2096.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think we have to be super nitpicky about it, because again, like for the people that are going to read it, they're going to be like, wow, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2103.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if we put it up on the walls, and even I think also maybe having a few copies for people to hang on to, especially if it's a long meeting and they're waiting for their turn, and they can maybe hang on to eliminated copy and like look through it while they wait, that would be really useful too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2116.963s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it does make me think like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2119.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What are the ways that we can present this in like bigger words, like easily accessible for people that maybe have a different like neuro-processing way of doing things, like maybe I do, a lot of people I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2134.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So like that kind of thing would be an interesting thing to discuss as like a next step too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2139.453s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But thank you so much, Justin, or Councilor Tseng, for putting this together because it is super thorough and for what it is, really clear, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2374.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it looks really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2376.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, again, I really appreciate the work you've done, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2380.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I especially like how to participate that sort of outlines the ways that if you're in the chambers, if you're on Zoom, we've had people with a lot of confusion about how to participate on Zoom, the raise hand, the ask, I've asked you to unmute, like that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2394.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, just the, I think it's really good for where we're at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2402.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think we should move ahead and, you know, see if we can get it out in the room<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2409.397s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would motion to move that process forward however we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2413.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we need to get it approved by the full council, I would motion that we bring it to the full council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2580.365s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, the motion is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2584.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: refer this paper, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2588.606s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Refer the paper to the regular meeting subject to the edits that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=40.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=41.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that is two papers, 24-036, Resolution to Discuss an Overgrowth Ordinance and 24-461,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=53.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=57.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if Director O'Connor would like to speak on these, they definitely do go hand in hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=64.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for that clarification, Vice President Collins and Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=309.648s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=514.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Before you go on, Vice President Collins, can you explain the difference between overgrowth on a residential property versus a commercial property versus something that may be like protected space that is natural space, I'm thinking, maybe along the Mystic River or in the fells, and why certain kinds of spaces are more susceptible to rodent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=541.775s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: increases in rodent population versus, I don't think that, this is sort of instinctual for me, I don't have data to back this up, but I think that this is true, that the fells and the area by the river isn't necessarily increasing rat populations or raccoons or things like that, because they're drawn to human waste or that this sort of human generated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=570.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=570.705s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if you could, if you or it may be a question for Director O'Connor too, but I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about that because overgrowth isn't the same as natural, you know, nature just taking its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=658.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's important to note that this isn't an issue of the visual appeal of a property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=664.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is only when there is a problem, just like what we talked about with the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=672.527s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not a problem until it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=676.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And every time you sort of say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=681.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, it's natural for us to think through the unintended consequences of something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=685.539s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, that's the important thing to note that this is a mechanism for when something becomes an issue, if we don't have an avenue to suggest that this is causing a problem, and there's a way for us to fix it, then we need to create an avenue to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=754.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, would you be willing to speak to how the rodent population differs in a city versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=764.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a natural landscape, just for my edification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=835.454s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=836.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=836.875s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And again, it's not a nuisance until it's a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=839.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=841.178s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins, I'll let you continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=842.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to catch that moment before we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1040.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, are there any other comments from members about, yes, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1229.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1283.076s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other comments from councilors about the prospect of Vice President Collins drafting the ordinance and then coming back with, you know, we can discuss the particulars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1301.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: once that's drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1305.138s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we want to, before we vote on that, I have a thought about, so would we wanna talk about the rodent control ordinance and updating that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1315.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1662.446s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we know is this a revolving fund or is it something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1673.561s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1675.904s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1857.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Vice President Collins, would you be able to email this information to the rest of the, to the committee so that we can just have it after the meeting, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2363.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2368.803s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: just a thought because I have a sense that Vice President Collins is going to make a motion to also draft this ordinance that maybe this could be spread around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2383.733s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You wanna just do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2386.334s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All right, I'm gonna leave it alone because I'm not allowed to make motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2391.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2456.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there any other discussion from members of the council on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2461.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming seconded this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2485.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2489.733s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any discussion on those before we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2492.814s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2493.795s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you call the roll once you have it written?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2511.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2512.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2514.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2515.693s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Vice President Collins will draft those and we can bring them to the next meeting and discuss them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2524.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate the work you've done on this so far and just a little bit of general cleanup and housekeeping for our town and our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2535.698s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's not glamorous work, but you've created a lane for yourself, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2542.963s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Don't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2544.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Don't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2546.245s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It has to be done, and we're grateful to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2550.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So is there any, or is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2554.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2555.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Vice President Collins, before we...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2581.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2581.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Director O'Connor, a solver of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=715.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=718.529s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I couldn't agree with you more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=720.11s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Haitian community in Medford is so critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=724.65s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when that was said by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=728.208s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: candidate for president of the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=730.23s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was so, it really hits home in Medford to me because so many of our friends here are Haitian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=742.058s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The people that come to America from Haiti are here legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=746.982s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're, not that there's whatever, but it's like something that I learned when I worked for the superintendent who is Haitian American herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=758.226s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and grew up in Medford and his family still lives in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=760.927s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And she told me that the most common languages that we need translation services for are Portuguese for our Brazilian American folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=774.931s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the second most common is Haitian Creole, not French, it's the Haitian dialect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=782.031s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then it's Arabic, and then it's Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=784.835s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was very interesting to me, and those were the people that we were hiring to do translation services for people that could translate to those languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=793.342s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very big population in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=796.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My daughter's best friend when she was in daycare and pre-K was a little girl who was Haitian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=803.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My husband plays in a 90s cover band with a Haitian guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=808.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are like, one of the best restaurants in Medford is a Haitian restaurant called the Neighborhood Restaurant, which if you haven't been there is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=817.917s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They catered our Juneteenth celebration here in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=822.691s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=824.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it is the fabric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=826.413s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Haitian community is part of what makes Medford unique and special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=831.035s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just think that the support that we can show to a community that might be feeling upset now is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=840.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=843.24s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's important that we just say out loud that this is not accurate or true and we voice our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1405.388s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I found them in order and motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1476.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2262.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate your effort to compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2265.306s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we've already, we have what was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2268.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a suggestion to move from 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2270.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to 3 a.m., and this is a compromise that's offered, I think we should vote on this compromise that was offered, and if it's not enough of a compromise, then maybe that's a no vote, but if, I will also say I grew up in a town that was extremely suburban and residential, and there were multiple 24-hour diners, which I loved, so we don't have any of those here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2292.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there are some people who have working hours that are different than a nine to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2300.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that having the opportunity to eat later because you have different working hours or a different lifestyle is something that I think we should be allowing our residents to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2313.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be inclined to vote yes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2653.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I definitely support this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2655.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's really critical to offer very basic, I mean, it's a human function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2664.409s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is also, it contributes to the, how do I phrase this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2674.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you're somebody who, there are sort of default mechanisms in cities and towns sometimes where people who are unhoused will be criminalized for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2685.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if you have public restrooms, that cuts down on the likelihood of that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2690.698s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that is really beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2694.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also just think, you know, we should make people's lives easier and better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2698.805s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's the business of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2700.286s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is a great way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2703.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've had many experiences as a parent where just sheer panic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2709.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this would be a really wonderful, a wonderful addition to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2712.953s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So definitely looking into what the costs would be, how we would save money over time, I think would be a great thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2719.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So looking forward to discussing it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4460.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4463.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In a vote, when you sever, are you voting separately for each of the two things, or are you only gonna vote on one of the things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4476.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=313.459s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=314.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So September is the month that we spend celebrating folks who are in recovery from substance use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=324.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a great time to understand how difficult that journey can be and how wonderful life can be in recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=334.716s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a number of ways that people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=339.864s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: celebrate that, but I wanted to make sure that it was something that we were aware of as a council and as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=345.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I spoke with the Board of Health in Medford and there's Medford Overcoming Addiction and our Board of Health department is very active in this space as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=357.841s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm just grateful for all the folks that I know who are in recovery and that they've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=364.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: actively on this journey, and I'm happy to be able to celebrate that here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=370.872s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=731.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=731.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We meant to discuss what I think will be the final discussion on the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=738.871s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nailed down the last details of that, and then we will be discussing it today in our regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3227.2s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins stole some of my things that I was going to say, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3231.482s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was very concise and well put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3234.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I did want to mention was that this is an amendment to a previously approved contract, as Vice President Collins mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3243.568s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this was something that was already agreed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3247.324s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've, we've said many times curb to curb being the industry standard so nobody ever says median.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3253.908s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I can also say I have, I live on a street that had work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3258.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it was before the past five years, and there was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3263.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: gas line that was replaced by National Grid under my street, and only half of our street was paved, which means there's a seam in the middle of the street, which means that there is already deterioration in the center of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3279.292s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's why it's important that we carry on the paving from one end of the street to the other end of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3285.673s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Main street being an extremely busy road, that intersection being complicated to drive through as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3291.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have the police station, we have a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3295.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3296.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wouldn't want to put our residents in any kind of situation where they would be facing any more complicated or dangerous scenarios at that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3308.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it's pretty clear to me that this is not something I would want to risk safety or cost in the future, but I appreciate the opportunity to look into it more in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3321.91s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3520.124s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we table this amendment, does it delay the work that is scheduled, any work that is scheduled or anything that needs to- I don't know, but that's-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3662.474s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8937.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree with what President Vares was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8945.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8951.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that the city wouldn't have been able to access the funds to pay out, you know, legal fees and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8961.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are, you know, blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8966.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8970.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: he just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8978.468s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8985.993s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8988.095s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9000.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: elements of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think, is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9008.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10533.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=622.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, there it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=628.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=630.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=632.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, was I muted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.227s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=633.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=634.827s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, this meeting will come to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=637.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is the public health and community safety committee, August 13th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=640.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, uh, clerk, can you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=645.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have one member on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=661.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=662.329s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is four present, one absent, and this meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=667.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Today we are talking about 23-449 offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to draft wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=675.578s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This paper has been in this committee for a little while and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=681.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Health Director, Animal Control Officer, Code Enforcement Officers, and a representative of KP Law are invited to attend this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=688.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Vice President Collins, if you would like to talk about where we have come since our last meeting and where we're going now and what we still have to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=875.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=876.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are you able to pull up the, yeah, and do the track changes there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1425.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1446.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe because of the intention of this ordinance being about feeding and not really about like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1453.291s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the other procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1454.031s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, the vaccination isn't really about feeding either, but that is often the intention of the capture of the feral cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1463.093s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the vaccination against rabies is a more direct animal control, though so is spaying and neutering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1471.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1472.476s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Did that come up in your discussion with Kitty Connection or with the animal control officer at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1606.698s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1608.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate your thorough work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1610.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have one question about Chapter 6, Article 3, Section 6 through 110.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1615.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I may have missed this in your description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1620.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the registration of feral cat caretaker, is that, sorry, is that our, that's our ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1626.75s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We already have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1627.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That exists already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1629.791s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, no, you don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1630.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's already on the books, then great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1633.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1635.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I love that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1639.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1639.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1641.266s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So does anybody have any responses or questions or follow-ups?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1644.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we need to change the language here in section E to include something about spaying and neutering or is it not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1651.191s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1653.132s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1656.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1717.044s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any motions on the floor about perhaps moving this to, yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1752.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Director O'Connor, thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1801.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1993.04s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1995.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1998.664s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's actually a good note for us going forward that we should be avoiding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2003.047s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: using language like or his or her designee, because I think we do that a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2010.357s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And just be really specific about who is in charge of enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2014.763s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that is good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2017.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So do we, yes, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2058.613s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Vice President Collins to adopt the edits and move this paper to the regular council meeting, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2074.838s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2077.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2077.94s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2104.403s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, that is five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2109.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2112.648s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjourn the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2119.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2135.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2139.142s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=985.218s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One suggestion, the pink above where your cursor is, can you change the word suffering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=994.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: At the June 11th meeting, we passed a resolution to recognize and discuss the Stop the Stigma campaign, which humanizes our neighbors with substance use disorder, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1008.049s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Strike out suffering from and just change it to with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1469.648s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1470.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also, I like the concept of the one pager as a really accessible length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1479.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that maybe if we started, maybe if we had an online document that was a one pager with maybe click through FAQs, because I think it could very quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1489.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: turn into a longer document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1491.545s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Once you get into Robert's rules, when you get into what does it mean to speak through the chair, I think those answers are gonna get longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1501.187s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think like just the basic information about what our city council based on our charter has under its purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1509.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So like the city council is in charge of zoning, approving the budget and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1516.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Those are like the big things that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1519.301s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And those are different from what the mayor's administration does and different from what the school committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1525.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And these are the three biggest branches of our local government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1531.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, you know, maybe working in conjunction with the mayor's office and the school committee to help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1541.076s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: residents understand what those differences are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1543.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if they need to do something that doesn't fall under the umbrella of the city council, that they can go to one of those different departments to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1553.142s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I find often that people will come to city council for something that might be a mayor's administration issue or a city issue that's under like public works or something like that, or a school committee issue, really it's something about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1569.045s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something that's being taught in the schools or something to do with a teacher or something to do with the school administration that's really a school committee issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1577.715s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that being said, I do think a one-pager is great, but that maybe there can be something that's like a longer thing that we can go to, whether that's online or on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1937.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do also wonder if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1943.103s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This may not be what we're talking about tonight, but I think that there might be a benefit to a guide for people who are coming in for their first council meeting, hoping to speak on an agenda item, and they don't know how or when or how to go about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1962.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it can be really intimidating, not knowing where to sit, not knowing who everybody is, what is a clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1970.325s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, like genuinely, these are confusing processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1974.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So part of me wonders about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1978.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: maybe it's a second, oh, sorry, maybe it's a second one pager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1981.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's like, so this is your first council meeting and you would like to speak on an agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1991.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Here's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1993.409s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would, if that's like more than you would wanna do, I would be happy to draft something if we end up wanting to maybe address that, because I think it would be separate from an introduction to the work of the council, what the council does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2009.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: because that might be a separate thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2012.407s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2234.025s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, we went through the social media guidelines for City Council social account, so we could post from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2244.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: if we wanted into, you know, Facebook groups or Reddit and just solicit using maybe a Google form, like what of the following would you be interested in learning about first, what would be the most important and present it like a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2262.307s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We could even have it attached to the newsletter when that goes out, like a link to the survey, if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2517.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think streamlining this simplifying us is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2528.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in our interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2530.03s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think I would fall on the side of, like I suggested the other way, but I would fall on the side of drafting something and then asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=755.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=758.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=761.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1503.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1506.018s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Public Health and Community Safety Committee is handling a couple of active issues right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1515.42s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We did briefly address a proposal for a warming and cooling center that I offered early in this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1524.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a discussion about what that would entail, what is needed to open a facility like that in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1534.153s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was just sort of broad strokes conversation beginning the discussion and early navigation of how that could look as time passes, the most pertinent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1553.407s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Part of that conversation remains space and how what space would be available and how, how we would access it and obviously also cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1567.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville and Revere that fund warming centers via their municipalities and their city budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1577.17s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It costs about $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1578.191s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they use municipal spaces that they have access to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1584.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's the next step of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1588.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1592.842s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: have a couple of things that are sort of haven't been addressed yet that are on this list, but this isn't quite up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1600.331s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this document maybe I could probably do some updating because we have discussed a few times the wildlife feeding ordinance in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1610.894s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I should communicate about that and update this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1614.156s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know this document is ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1621.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1622.76s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we've talked about the wildlife feeding ordinance, and that is on its way in the direction, I think, of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1636.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: completion, but it's not quite there yet still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1639.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1640.793s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe the place that we're at with that is waiting on some responses from city staff, the animal control department, so that we can move forward with bringing it back to a regular meeting and passing that ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1653.925s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1656.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a couple of other things, you know, the interesting thing about this document to me as a new Councilor is that it's, it was sort of difficult for me to anticipate what might show up on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1670.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wasn't certain coming in what things were going to appear before us and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1680.899s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: what we wanted to have happen and what ends up happening are two different things, kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1685.603s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm interested to see, you know, how everything continues to develop, but there are a couple of things that I know, even just in the last meeting that are going to show up on, in different committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1700.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, these, this could use a light bit of updating, and I know the wildlife feeding ordinance being added to the public health community safety committee would be one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1711.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, so that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1714.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, one other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1715.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We did talk about the, we got the update on surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1720.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The surveillance report was updated in that committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1725.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2952.962s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1323.382s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1668.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2482.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the Department of Public Works committee makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2487.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan is the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2490.726s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think because it's to do with traffic, changing the roadways and intersections there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2498.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That intersection, it's the one right below the overpass of Route 16, the bridge over the river, right by deep cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2508.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very busy intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2510.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2517.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in charge of it, but it is really integral to how the center of Medford operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2525.507s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it's important that we make sure that the community is involved and we have a lot of stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2533.854s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it would be a great opportunity for that committee to have a fruitful discussion and make sure that we're sharing our opinions on how best to address improvements<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4090.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Point of information, President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4095.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can we please use the words medical office instead of dispensary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14050.044s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14051.586s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know Councilor Collins has a motion to send it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14060.194s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm not sure if I can motion to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14115.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, my reasoning behind my motion to carry this forward as written is that, sorry, I don't know why there's so much feedback when I use my microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14137.29s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It'll just have to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14138.609s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14139.85s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reasoning behind this is that it is part of a, seems like a pretty comprehensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14150.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The planning and permitting committee has so much going on with the zoning right now that this feels like it's, we don't have, I don't think we have the capacity to go over it in planning and permitting with any kind of speed or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14169.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in any kind of timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14170.918s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's my thinking, just to explain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14226.806s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, how do I, what, it's not motion to present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14231.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15360.136s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to speak on the appropriation for Medford High School MSBA feasibility study, which is required for us to receive any funding from the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15371.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We must do a feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15375.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The way that free cash works is that it is calculated based on what was budgeted for the prior year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15386.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and what was spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15388.186s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So free cash will come about at various points during the year and if it's not spent, it shows up and is available for the use of the municipality at various points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15403.052s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's why free cash became available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15406.413s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Free cash is being used for this non-negotiable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15412.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: feasibility study that we must do if we hope to ever have access to Massachusetts School Building Authority funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15424.122s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Since we are shortlisted, I'm on the building committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15427.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have been meeting about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15430.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This committee, this council must approve this in order to move forward with building a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15438.071s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's imperative that we approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15442.093s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18878.233s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Council is our um, thank you for presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18883.877s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18886.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: agree with what Vice President Collins said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18889.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say that it is a difficult thing to present, especially after a decade of no cost of living increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18906.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's difficult as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18912.054s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: head of a city to propose that you give yourself a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18916.738s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reason I am in favor of this is because our current mayor will not be our current mayor forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18924.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's the same reason that I was in favor of the raises for our school committee members, which is that every subsequent person that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18936.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: become the mayor will have to live on a salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18939.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we can't have that position only available to people who are able to live on a salary that is not a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18952.638s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It precludes people who are not independently wealthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18957.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if the person who would like to run for mayor at some future time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18966.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: they will need to live in Medford, they will need to be able to afford it, and this is what will be required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18971.018s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So going forward, we'll have to make these adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18976.741s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is just what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18979.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I appreciate the willingness to put that forward for now and for everybody who will hold these positions in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18988.021s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's challenging because it feels weird, but it's something that we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18992.524s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm in support of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18993.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And as Vice President Collins said, I'm also in favor of giving people raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18999.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=41.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=155.577s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=292.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=440.954s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, we held a meeting to discuss the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=445.217s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A few things came up, but we decided to keep the paper and committee pending some discussion with city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1430.731s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1432.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2059.525s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4394.062s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4395.243s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4396.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's so nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4398.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate what you presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4400.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate everything Vice President Collins said as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4404.57s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is my first budget experience, and it's very reminiscent of what I experienced in the school department when we went through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4414.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: department by department and discussed in meetings what each department's proposal was and how it would all fit into the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4423.327s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The school department has to present a balanced budget every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4427.451s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when I worked for the schools, that was what was the expected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4432.937s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: experience and I found this this year's budget meetings to be incredibly transparent and incredibly useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4441.102s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just for the public, if you're curious, you can see you can read the notes on all of our budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4446.905s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everything is available and should illuminate a lot about what we discussed and most of the departments are being level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4459.151s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is just maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4461.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: service in a lot of cases or improving service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4463.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's, it's, it's, to me, this is a very hopeful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4467.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think it speaks a lot to what our values are as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4471.942s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I, I really think that, uh, this budget says that we care about the infrastructure of our city and about investing in our city and about, um, making sure that our city employees have, uh, their positions and their, uh, environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4488.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: funded from a source that's more permanent and that we believe in them and we care about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4494.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it also means most significantly because it's the biggest part of the budget that we want to fund our public schools, the teachers and the students that are part of our Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4505.962s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is the biggest part of the budget and it is incredibly significant that we step up as a community and we dedicate ourselves to making sure that that's our priority and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4517.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that Mayor, you hit it right on the head when you said residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4523.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not forcing anybody to do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4527.504s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a democratic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4529.285s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can say yes or no to each of these questions on the ballot in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4534.128s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's a beautiful thing to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4538.871s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The fact that it hasn't, we haven't had the opportunity to say yes or no in the past is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4545.962s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a challenge that we've faced this whole time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4547.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think this is exciting and hopeful and sets the stage for a great future for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4555.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm very excited and I really appreciate everything that you've done for us and all of the work that was done by the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4562.858s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm very excited to see where we go from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4565.601s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4565.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4566.141s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14819.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14819.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know it is late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14821.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will try to keep this brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14823.541s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have worked with many,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14825.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: people with substance use disorders in my time working at the Malden Warming Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14833.197s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there's been some conversation about something that our body will never approve or not approve, but there's been discussion in our community about a clinic that will offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14854.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: medication-assisted treatment, medicines for opioid use disorder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14859.889s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when those conversations are happening, I just thought it would be prudent to bring up something called Stop the Stigma, which is a campaign that highlights that the stigma against people dealing with substance use disorder can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14878.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Additionally, damaging to people with substance use disorders and can prevent people from seeking treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14884.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: People in recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14887.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Deal with a lot of negative stigma associated with The disease of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14894.586s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14895.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to present this and encourage folks to research this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14904.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very close to my heart and very important to me, and I'd be happy to discuss it at length if people are interested, but I know it is after 11 p.m., and this is the budget meeting, so that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14921.934s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My great hope in presenting this now is only that we recognize that substance use disorder is recognized as a disease by the medical community and that people with that disease are protected, have a protected status and should be considered people with a disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14942.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's not appropriate to talk about people with a disability in a blanket kind of negative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14951.811s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14983.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's sort of like how we celebrate Haitian American Flag Day, in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14991.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Stop the Stigma doesn't have a day, though during my work in Malden at the Malden Warming Center, there is a day that's celebrated in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15002.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's celebrated in March, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15004.597s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it's just a it was just decided in as a city to celebrate it on a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15008.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we don't we don't do that in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15011.742s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But and this wouldn't be to encourage us to do a day I just wanted to present it as an awareness raising issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15021.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Mainly because as a an elected body, we are not approving or not approving the business that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15033.976s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: trying to open on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15036.298s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we don't have any ability to like stake a claim in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15043.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I did feel that it was a it was something that was important to me to state sort of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15051.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the way that we talk about Medford residents and the way that we as a community engage with people with disabilities, people with diseases, and the way that we try to sort of help our residents should be sort of front of mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15066.784s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just wanted to raise awareness of it as a community issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15753.276s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I may, since we do not, it's a special permit to approve that space and we are sort of limited in what we're capable of saying yes or no to as far as that clinic opening in that space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15766.581s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's the Community Development Board and then the Zoning Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15771.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It really is a matter of referring folks to those meetings and saying, you can review the documents that are on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15779.269s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're all online with those boards on their, it's the city's website, but it'll be under those umbrellas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15787.375s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But also the Board of Health in Medford is very involved in this kind of work, and I'm sure they would appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15797.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that would be where I would start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15801.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: because there is a great interest in trying to help people navigate this sort of thing, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15809.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15810.99s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did get your email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15811.771s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't have a chance to reply to it, but I'll write you back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16423.565s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you to the folks that spoke, and I'm just sorry for your loss, Bill, and anybody who has lost folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16435.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a very tough thing, and the only point I was making here is that I want us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16441.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: speak about our residents and our family members and our friends and maybe parents at the Roberts who are currently in recovery and maybe they're walking their kids to school right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16449.965s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe they take methadone or Suboxone and maybe they're just in your community right now as we speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16456.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the way that we talk about each other should be respectful and kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16602.78s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=799.189s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=801.03s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4357.969s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion to approve the Chapter 74 form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4360.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4361.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4496.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we should actually, that's a good call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4499.342s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We'll put the science labs in that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4504.563s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4555.646s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5153.883s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5155.364s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5600.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We already have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5651.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a comment sort of similar to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5655.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: talking about the possibility of greater openness and leaning into the assets of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5663.282s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something I'd like to mention that we could maybe integrate into section four if we're, I don't know if we're here yet, but community engagement that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5676.519s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you want me to wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6259.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Emily, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6263.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, so I, I sort of what triggered my thoughts on this was what somebody said about what John was saying about the idea of the school being kind of an open campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6276.879s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6279.415s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to see something in this section that's a little bit about the idea of the space being also kind of a community hub outside of just the high schoolers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6290.303s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there are a lot of community things that happen here, the community schools, the pool, the network, family network, a lot of things happen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6303.753s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, I mean, and I thought about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6306.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: obviously, and unfortunately for myself volunteering too, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6310.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6313.885s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd be happy to put that in and integrate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6316.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6317.587s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6318.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do think that we have so much space here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6322.469s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know that in the early days of this building, there were more students and now there are fewer, but that if we do end up changing locations and having a smaller building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6336.155s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that we sacrifice one of the perks of this large space, which is that there are a lot of opportunities to use it for a lot of different community, a lot of attention for community good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6352.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is doing that now, and it can continue to do it, and it can do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6357.632s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6447.108s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was in like a, it was in a science club, but it was, that's, that's one of the things they do there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6452.449s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So like, there is a lot of potential and really just in like a city council, like it's a revenue generator to have more of these programs to bring in funds to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6464.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And like, these are all, these are all good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6469.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=29.001s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=81.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The second or third time we've discussed the wildlife feeding ordinance and I will ask Vice President Collins to take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=299.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that on the main?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=313.675s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is showing up on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=320.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Hold on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=320.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=348.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does that show up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=349.464s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, still no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=353.048s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=357.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, but it's, just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=385.915s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming, are you, do you have access to this document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=392.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=393.021s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=395.422s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, great, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=410.033s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=415.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins has an opinion from AP Law that she's going to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=440.051s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=929.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=932.738s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the subject of, I have two thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=937.48s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One is about the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=943.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: compost and trash receptacles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=948.775s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In my imagining of this, the only, the scenario in which that would be a problem is if a property is in like disrepair, disarray, sort of not being maintained well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=966.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that would be like one of maybe a few avenues we would have to say like this property is not being maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=972.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is an ordinance that says that this is against local rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=977.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we should, you know, we can enforce these rules, but the danger is that we'd not make it impossible to follow our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=994.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and also not impossible to enforce them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=997.606s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So being that we are implementing the new composting program, I mean, those, the trash cans, which I would, I think are going to be similar to the ones that are the smaller versions of the trash cans now have lids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1013.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it should be that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1015.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like it kind of takes care of itself, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1017.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1105.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1107.898s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The second thought that I had is I was curious to hear our Board of Health Directors opinion on this, but something that I had brought up in a previous meeting was about feral cats, stray cats, and trapping and either spaying and neutering and releasing or having them become domesticated and like adopting out these cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1135.471s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1136.806s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are some folks in the area who do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1141.208s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I lost a cat recently, and then I borrowed a trap from somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1145.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And so I know that this is something that people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1148.493s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They weren't from Medford, they were from Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1150.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm not outing anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1152.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that, Director O'Connor, if you have any, just about if that's something that we would want to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1162.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: not have be part of this because they do put food inside the traps in order to attract those animals if they know that they're around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1170.764s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the idea behind it, I believe, is to reduce the population of cats that are in the area because you're, you know, sort of reducing that sort of, it is kind of a nuisance to have like lots of stray cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1187.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm curious to hear your perspective, if you wouldn't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1192.33s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can unmute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1195.172s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1198.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1199.294s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1328.701s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1332.042s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments before we consider engaging with, would you like to go in and start adding some of these or should we do it separately and kind of come back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1475.049s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1478.79s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any for Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1558.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The thing about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1560.728s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the feral cats is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1562.109s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it is such a niche phenomenon and the people that do it are really dedicated and are doing it because they care a lot about this population of animals and they're trying to protect them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1580.784s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And in my very limited experience with it, I think that it is like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1587.31s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1589.492s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I do recognize that there could be like neighbor disputes about this and you would want there to be an opportunity for somebody to bring like a conflict somewhere if they needed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1604.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: However, you don't want as a city to have to litigate every neighbor conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1609.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: over something that seems relatively innocuous in the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1614.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess that's where I'm, that's where in my heart, I'm going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1619.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But so my impulse is to sort of stay out of it to whatever degree I can, because I think it's like, it's really probably having limited impact on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1634.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the fact that the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1640.169s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think if we defined pets and said that cats would be considered pets, I think that would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1654.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think eliminating the possibility that somebody can feed a feral or stray cat is like impossible to say what's a feral or stray cat sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1664.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Often they don't wear collars and cats are just walking around and maybe you're feeding somebody, your neighbor's cat that you don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1670.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like how much of this are we litigating and how much of it is our responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1675.45s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It starts to sort of cross the line into the absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1678.852s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just don't, I don't know how much of that we need to wade into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1685.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1775.279s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1775.579s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1852.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree with that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1854.17s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a good move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1859.371s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other thoughts on any of the other suggested changes from legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1934.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Every time we write ordinances, we're changing the rules of the city, and it deserves the time and respect that it takes to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1943.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we should take the time to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5933.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you for bringing this to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6258.098s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6273.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When is free cash certified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6293.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, but the impression I'm getting is that Councilor Scarpelli is concerned that there may be a deadline here about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6305.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6305.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm confused about the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6315.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If it's not done before June 30th, it cannot then be made until up to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6321.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=413.971s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, yes, so the sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=416.753s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there anything that you would need from us for authorization to do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=420.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it is it a city program that you would be able to implement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=424.599s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I'm the attachment that we have in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=433.058s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is about your position, but not about the program that you're describing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=438.722s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it a program that exists elsewhere or not really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=452.771s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: cool well it sounds really awesome to me i definitely think that there's a place for programs like this uh i i think that there are a lot of situations where people who are really on the very low end of um sort of the economic ladder will have a lot of services that are available and then there are people that don't require any services but there are people that are somehow in the middle that you sort of experience some difficulty they kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=476.798s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=478.359s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this does sound like a program that would be really beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=481.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if there's a known issue, I'm I think that it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=486.084s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess what I'm curious about is how we can, you know, facilitate the process and how we can make sure that it's, you know, something that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=504.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Legal, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=643.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, well, I would be happy to make that motion the motion to send this proposal to legal counsel so that we can, you know, facilitate this programs execution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1021.027s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, just to quickly reply, um, uh, the only reason I put that in is because there were, um, there was like no opposition in the chambers to that particular piece of legislation, which was unique for our, which, you know, the Councilors know, uh, that is unique for our experience when we are presenting, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1040.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a piece of legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1042.551s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that seems sort of safe to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1044.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that is a super fair point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1047.334s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Callahan and I appreciate you bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1049.135s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I definitely support us pulling that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1051.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I haven't thought about it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1053.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's, that's definitely I would agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1056.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so yes, agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1143.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's totally fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1146.449s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As the first not-Councilor-Leming person to write a newsletter, I was experimenting with how much of my own voice we were going to have be part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1159.315s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm comfortable with removing any of the non-facts in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1164.518s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And also, I guess this is something for us to discuss as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1168.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How much of the newsletter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1173.376s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And now we don't weep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1176.889s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To also to articulate just a small bit of my background, I used to write literal humor pieces for the internet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1186.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is the least I could have possibly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1190.856s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's still, I understand, too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1193.197s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that all being said, we can remove all of the anything that's anything but exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1205.754s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I guess I do wonder, what is the newsletter besides a list of what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1213.139s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I guess the answer is nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1214.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is just a list of what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1216.221s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's because people don't know what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1218.362s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's what we're communicating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1219.402s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're telling people what happened so that they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1222.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do want people to be interested, but the point isn't for people to be entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1227.507s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just for people to be made aware of something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1230.409s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1605.009s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was going to say something similar to what the director just said, which is that if there is a tax benefit to keeping storefronts vacant, I think that we should verify that with a tax professional before moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1625.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If that means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1627.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: before moving forward with writing the basic first step home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1632.27s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if we need to do that before then or after when we're deciding if we want to pass this and then decide later as we're writing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1641.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure that exists either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1643.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1649.045s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One, the second thing is, I wonder if some portion of this is sort of a, you can't squeeze blood from a stone situation, and that some of the storefronts might be vacant because of what was mentioned earlier, that there's some insurmountable amount of, you know, the building's not up to code and they can't afford to bring it up to code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1673.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and therefore it can't be rented out because the owners of the property are unable to reach enforcement levels of, you know, eliminate the violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1685.533s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm not sure how, I'm not sure we as a council are at the level of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1693.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't feel myself that I'm at the level of understanding of the nuances of the situation yet, but also that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1702.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I could be convinced that this process, all that we need to do is have a basic understanding of the problem and that we are looking for approval from the state to begin greater understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1717.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Though I would personally feel more comfortable if we had more details and more data to back up how this would benefit us in filling this reference, particularly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1728.968s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in my neighborhood in West Bedford Square that has a bunch of empty storefronts right now, which is unappealing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1735.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do understand the need for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1737.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I agree that there is a need for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1739.391s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I'm not sure that I can point to, like, add a spreadsheet or presentation that would make me see more clearly that this is the solution that's going to get us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1752.236s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would feel more comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7.574s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5013.76s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: just a couple things point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5015.222s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: First off, our city finance director did talk about the charter reimbursements that's covered in the city budget, one of their line items, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5046.153s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, I think if you wanted to ask him about that, you could probably show it to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5057.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I asked him about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5071.173s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5074.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5075.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: thought I had is that I think it's possible that we may be losing students on the higher grades to private and charter because of the historic underfunding of our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5084.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I do have a question that is pertinent to the work that our city council can do, which is about the homeless transport in the schools and the fact that it costs so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5094.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was wondering if you knew, and you may not, do you know if that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5099.873s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: is so much higher than it's been budgeted for in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5104.18s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it higher this year than it has been in previous years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5106.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it always higher and we just overspend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5114.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's just something that's overspent from that and maybe pulled from another line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5142.381s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Could you explain to me what you mean by rigorous bid process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5168.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Taxi services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5234.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am curious about the degree to which greater services for homeless families in Medford would allay some of the costs of transporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5246.722s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if you're finding that when families do deal with the effects of becoming homeless, if they have to find shelter further away, does it only<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5261.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: happen when they are actively living in shelters or does it continue, does the transport continue when they have permanent housing or do they then relocate to a new district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5348.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's called McKinney-Vento?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5349.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5350.004s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5352.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very important for stability for students, and it's something that's important to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5356.647s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's unfortunate it's expensive, but I do think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5360.009s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just like, how do you kind of find a way to balance it so that it doesn't necessarily have to be so expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5365.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But thank you for that explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5366.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1293.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is similar to the question that Councilor or Council Vice President Collins asked, but there's an asterisk on the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1301.057s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I didn't say thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1302.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1305.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To reiterate, there's an asterisk on the bottom under the personnel services summary that says eight firefighters are anticipated to start in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1314.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1317.641s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's no change between the 2024<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1321.072s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: budgeted firefighters and the 2025 budget firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1326.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are eight people retiring and eight people are starting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1329.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How does that move around?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1371.024s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, before they even start the academy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1373.185s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How long are they in the academy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1440.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have one more question, if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1443.953s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What, in your view, would be a fully staffed fire department for Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1499.65s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this is like a goal, this is a goal amount of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1503.312s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3315.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wasn't expecting the parking department to be so inspiring, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3322.579s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Very happy to hear this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3324.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And what an exciting thing that you've really turned things around and paying for your whole own department functionally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3333.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3334.282s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if there is any kind of concrete way that we can help support the hiring of more enforcement officers in the future,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3345.631s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can say that I can see evidence of the need for that in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3350.854s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I do understand that being something that is a critical need, but congratulations on all of your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3359.778s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's very evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3400.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3401.638s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11968.586s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Zargarpur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11973.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We've been here for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11975.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I may be missing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11979.348s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The payments that we make to KP Law, what budget does that come out of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11982.87s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that included here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12008.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess what I'm asking is, if the thinking here is to save an amount of money in the legal department so that it can be used in the school department to balance the budget, how much is being saved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12034.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is something that is happening in various departments in order to balance the school budget in the meantime, because it's legally required that we have a balanced school budget to present to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12047.47s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But $78,000 is not a very large amount of money for a city's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12056.377s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: From my perspective, I'm just saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=11.0s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1597.56s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1598.36s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate this really clearly very level funded budget here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1605.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, things are going up, things are going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1608.249s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's looking almost the same as last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1610.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As a new councilor, I have a couple clarifying questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1614.614s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1615.435s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've never really looked at the budget at this scale before, but just to help me understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1624.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the way that overtime is calculated here, it's gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1629.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Overtime for officers has gone down by $50,000 from last year's budget, but it's separate from holiday pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1637.309s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you help me understand how that's negotiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1638.93s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that part of the contract for officers or is it based on something else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1643.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How is that and is it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1646.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how is overtime calculated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1743.466s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1746.928s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But there is a possibility to kind of schedule creatively to sort of try to tighten up overtime, which sounds like you've been attempting to do, and it looks like you're trying to do with this budget in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1769.438s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I just very quickly did like, just divided that it would be about, it's budgeted around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1777.824s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: $10,700 per officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1779.346s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But is that is is does that usually work out evenly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1783.529s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it it depends on who's on staff that day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1787.111s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or just it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1833.171s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate that there's a lot of moving parts to this and everything has scales and everybody's trying to fit the puzzle pieces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1840.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate you coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=1843.84s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm trying to understand it all, so thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=62.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: want to consider adding that just came to me today was that we should mention, this is sort of an assumption, but it's probably best to include it in writing, is that in an effort to be proactive about our compliance with open meeting law, just to put in the policy that we would make sure not to have any Councilors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=89.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: not to have a quorum of Councilors replying on a thread on social media, because that could constitute an open meeting law violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=100.225s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that doesn't, it doesn't totally apply to what we would be talking about here, but it might help to just have it on the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=104.926s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that could be one amendment we can add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=108.247s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But what this, what this basically outlines is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=113.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We could create social media accounts for the major social media, like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=125.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: X, I guess, not Twitter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=128.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we could have it be a city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=132.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have a Twitter, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=135.36s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it could be a city council specific account, like the mayor's office has, a mayor's office specific account, but that doesn't cover city council specific business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=149.588s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this way we could share it, things that are applicable to our work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=157.393s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Notifications about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=160.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: important meetings that might be coming up, or listening sessions, which we'll talk about later in this meeting, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=168.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is just some broad guidelines about how those accounts would be handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=176.321s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm happy to make any adjustments, but this is just a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=286.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would suggest that we would add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=292.177s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, maybe in the, um, maybe at the, at the end of the guide, the last section guidelines for official Medford city council use at a, at a bullet point that says no, a quorum of city councilors shall not comment on a thread on social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=322.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: which would constitute an open meeting law violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=341.75s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=343.691s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sort of being overzealous about it, so I'm comfortable with not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=401.665s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Plus, neither of us being lawyers, it's not really our business to interpret the law yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=409.608s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=410.068s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK, I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2361.393s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I thought it would be in an effort to start things moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2365.835s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't have to keep this appointment, but I thought I would speak to Pam at the Council on Aging and who is at the Senior Center every day to just see if we could get a meeting on the books that when there are a million activities there every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2382.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I thought we could try to find a time when it's not too busy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2388.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: there's availability at the center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2390.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We wouldn't be able to go as a large group of Councilors because it would be a quorum and we would obviously be discussing something of interest to, you know, the things that we talk about during our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2402.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we would have to just be like one or two Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2405.332s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we can talk about this more, but I imagine we would just sort of hear out folks' thoughts and then bring that back to our meetings, either hearing committee or regular meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2418.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The date that she and I talked about was May 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2422.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a Friday at about 10 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2426.085s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But again, just for the sake of getting something scheduled,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2432.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then we can kind of go from there, either reschedule it or see if we want to move forward with that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2439.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did meet with Pam and talk about, you know, if that would be something that was of interest to people at the senior center and my thinking being that if we, if we kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2452.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: start with something like the senior center and maybe the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2455.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Knowing that those spaces are already fully open to the public, anybody from Medford can come at any point, and there aren't any, from my perspective, there aren't any major barriers to people accessing those spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2476.382s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It obviously isn't available for every single person in Medford But we know that they you don't have to like pay a fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2481.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You don't have to be a member you just come So if we make ourselves available to at least a couple of places to begin with Then we can get started sooner rather than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2538.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know, but I would think no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2540.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the better attitude would be for one or two Councilors to just mostly record it being a listening session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2548.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The attitude isn't really to be debating things necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2553.392s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It would just be to say, what do you care about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2557.715s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What do you want me to know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2558.636s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What do you want me to share with the rest of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2562.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: rather than saying like, this is what I think and this is what we're, this is what I wanna do, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2567.781s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cause then it's on a listening session anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2570.742s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's more like collecting the information and then relaying it to the rest of the group when we're in open meetings and then we could talk about it more thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2582.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's my thinking anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=3127.348s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=3131.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=3133.512s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to begin listening sessions with May 31st at the Senior Center at 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6534.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Another thing I will add is that these meetings have been really beneficial to me as a new Councilor, but also just as a private citizen seeing that many, most of the departments that have presented to us are basically just asking for a level of funding, but that the increases do not translate to level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6556.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are necessary additions each time a department presents something that necessitates an increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6565.908s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it really is adding up exponentially as all of these departments come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6571.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think if we had to do this all over the course of just a few nights, it would have been, I'm sure you guys experienced this before, it would have been so overwhelming to see it all compiled all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6583.442s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate the bite-sized pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6585.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate everybody taking multiple nights out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6589.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of their lives to present this to us in easily consumable portions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6594.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1734.727s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Test, test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1736.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1736.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've only said yes so far, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2771.593s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6530.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I had raised my hand earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6531.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6533.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate you mentioning something about the Resident Services Committee, that you had voiced the same concerns during that meeting, but then you had left the Zoom and didn't hear our responses, but I had offered to bring that paper to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6553.576s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It did not get a second, and it didn't get voted to come to the regular meeting, so it didn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6558.337s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I also offered to, uh, speak with our director of diversity, equity and inclusion, which did that motion did pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6567.208s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I spoke with her today about ways that we can best, um, take advantage of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6574.798s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: her and her expertise and our affinity groups and our different opportunities in the city to make sure that we're taking advantage of all the resources that we have at our disposal to make sure that the newsletter is reaching our residents to the best of our abilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6595.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A few things that she mentioned were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6600.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I understand the intention of the newsletters to be emailed, but also that we could have paper copies and we can bring them to events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6608.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe we can distribute them along with the listening sessions once those are off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6613.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and then, um, something director noise I mentioned is, uh, bringing bringing paper copies to things like the Haitian flag ceremony that's coming up May 18th and meeting communities where they already are instead of requesting that folks come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6630.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um so that's something that we discussed, but I would intend to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6641.189s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I would also reiterate what Vice President Collins says and hope that we can keep our comments on this to what's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8494.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8496.495s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I haven't, I don't know what this letter is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8498.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8499.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I haven't read it and I can't find it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8501.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can we not talk about the letter anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8503.48s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cause I literally, I don't even know what the letter is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8507.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not on the agenda and it's not included in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8509.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I don't feel equipped to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8512.505s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's not something that we were supposed to talk about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8850.002s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12232.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: From what I've read about the reasoning behind the interest in removing the protesters from the tough squad also is that I think that there can be some justifications made for use of force in removing protesters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12249.143s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with this, but that it would be for blockage of traffic or some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12259.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: danger posed to the public, but this is on Tufts property and only for the purpose of setting up for commencement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12269.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would definitely caution the Medford Police Department that it really doesn't seem to be the business of our administration or our Medford police to be involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12288.251s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think this is a big national movement that's happening and that students should be allowed to express their opinions and practice their First Amendment rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12300.302s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And just as an anecdotal story, I was in the car listening to NPR when they were talking about police removing protesters from Columbia University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12310.705s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And my nine-year-old said, is protesting illegal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12313.085s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I said, no, it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12315.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is very much not illegal to protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12318.666s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's all I'll say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12320.007s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=13.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=13.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=15.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Stroud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1917.651s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not a question, just a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1918.732s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say I love the idea of the free swimming lessons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1922.074s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's so important for public safety and health to make sure our residents are able to swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1929.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I really support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1930.2s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if you need any backup or, you know, letters of support where you're writing grants or anything like that, I'd be happy to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1936.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that's an awesome initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1938.406s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=13.173s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=18.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=416.396s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have more of a broad question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=419.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This being the newsletter draft for April and us having another week of April left and there being the possibility that we could pass a number of other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=436.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: items in the next few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=442.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am wondering, like, we have a regular meeting on the 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=447.437s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm wondering how we want to organize when these go out, month over month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=747.067s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: At the last meeting we also discussed texting options, WhatsApp options, paper options, and translation options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=755.969s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it was discussed extensively at the last meeting that we would make sure to prioritize serving underserved communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=763.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a big priority of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1638.933s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're doing a lot of back and forth right now, and I just want you to know that I see you having to do these updates at this moment, and it could be a little bit stressful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1650.096s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think maybe in an effort to not have perfect be the enemy of good, and that, I think, can also extend to not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1665.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as far as the newsletter, and being afraid to try something because you're not sure it could reach everybody in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1675.894s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that even if this version is not the very final, most perfect version, and as we keep learning and as we get feedback from residents,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1687.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, we keep making it better as time goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1692.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to, I'm not sure if I can, if I would make this as a motion, but I think I would like to speak with our DEI director and City Hall about how best to make sure we're, you know, I don't know why the sound is being weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1709.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: how best to, you know, for the purposes of this first newsletter or going forward, you know, how best to make sure we're trying to access as many people as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1720.14s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would be happy to do that, but I guess I would motion to speak with Director Nwaje about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1728.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: as we work to distribute the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1732.076s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that's one motion that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1735.36s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: A second motion is I would like to say this for me, clerk, as a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1743.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Make it sound<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1744.674s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1746.736s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we should bring it to the regular meeting or at our next meeting, potentially, so that we can approve it as part of the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1755.042s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And once we have it in like a final form for this version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1760.587s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But again, it not having to be perfect, perfect, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1766.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because nothing's ever perfect when you're writing stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1770.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's always a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1773.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, uh, that being said, I also would confirm for, uh, or agree or back up what Councilor Colin Callahan was saying about, um, I'm not sure if you were saying this exactly, but, um, maybe we can use some of our city council language, but maybe we can simplify some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1797.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, there's some terms that I think are confusing to a lot of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1802.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think home rule petition is confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1804.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think even paper number can be confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1807.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think a lot of people don't even know what a paper is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1809.949s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1814.446s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sending something to committee can even be confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1816.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sometimes maybe there could be maybe there could be a glossary section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1820.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe this isn't something that we do for the first newsletter, but maybe down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1826.659s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe there's like a layman's terms version or like a like a quick summary version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1831.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like what are the what are the need to knows in the beginning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1835.548s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What's the TLDR?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1837.009s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in the beginning of the newsletter, or maybe that's just an event section that's like, what do you need to know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1842.954s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When are the regular meetings this month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1846.677s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What are the committee meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1847.578s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What do you want to try to get to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1849.74s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sometimes we don't know, but we could at least let people know the really critical information so they don't have to know all the terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1862.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1863.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm giving myself kind of a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1866.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm realizing as the more I talk, the more work I'm giving myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1871.731s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Too much brainstorming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1873.512s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe there are some bad ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1965.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reason that I would want to is just mainly because Councilor Scarpelli didn't feel comfortable approving it in committee and saying that it had not been on the regular meeting schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1978.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I mean, if it doesn't pass our, I mean, we're here now, if it doesn't pass, it doesn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1984.01s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2274.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2276.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have two motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2277.378s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2279.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you are prepared to receive them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2284.221s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, we didn't get a second on my motion to send it to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2293.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, well, I have two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2297.182s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have another motion to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2311.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: To approve the newsletter written by Matt for May, April 2024 as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2321.859s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As edited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2322.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2323.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And to approve the draft schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2328.271s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's included in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2331.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does that work for you Anna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2332.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2519.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2534.125s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that sounds awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2535.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think one a month is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2536.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would just ask, are all Councilors invited to attend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2541.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would there be input from other Councilors on location and time and things like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2547.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or would it be just the subcommittee that would establish that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2594.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: probably talking to people about what space is available and who can get a conference room and what building at what time, that kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=13.0s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=576.579s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Could you talk a little bit more about what you just said about charter schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=580.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was not aware about there being a reimbursement for charter school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=585.066s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I thought we only paid out for charter school tuition when students attend charter schools that would normally attend Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=664.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: reimbursements for various things, accounting for the small reimbursement for the charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=670.337s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=671.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just thought that might be a cool new program I hadn't heard about yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=674.018s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, it's part of the formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=677.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=678.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=679.74s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=16.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1428.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4895.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4897.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to introduce myself, Director Shah, because I am not in person, I'm on Zoom, but I wanted to say hi since you're new and just voice my support for your department and you being here and the work that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4912.999s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so happy to hear that you're trying to make your office accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4916.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I have a particular interest in the work that you're doing when you mentioned affordable housing and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4923.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: um, work to try to make sure that our veterans are accessing the services that they need, especially around homelessness, um, uh, avoiding homelessness and making sure that we're taking care of people who are facing that sort of, uh, challenge is really critical, especially in the veteran community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4942.139s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so, uh, just to kind of reiterate that that is a concern in Medford and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4950.985s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, we have a lot of these conversations in our city council meetings a lot of the time and sometimes it's easy to forget that the people that may be facing these kind of concerns are people that have served our country and that have been really critical to our community and that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4974.139s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh our our city hall staff are are working on a regular basis to try to make sure that we're taking care of them and um I just really appreciate the work that you're doing and I just didn't want to get lost in the sort of zoom universe here I just wanted to like sort of say thank you for coming out and for um mentioning uh the work that you're doing and um also I I think probably Kevin and um my her name is slipping my mind or um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5016.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a really great process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5018.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so glad to hear everything in such great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5021.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you so much for presenting tonight, Director Shaw, and I appreciate the work you're all doing for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=177.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We held a public health and community safety committee meeting on Tuesday last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=184.445s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The chief of police presented a report on the pilot program of the police department on body worn cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=195.769s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And there was a public comment and we received the report and placed it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=202.291s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2957.186s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3454.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the first person I canvassed this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3459.873s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I went to his house, and he was the first person I spoke to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3462.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he gave me really, really good advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3465.416s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He said to make sure that you earn votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3468.918s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You don't just ask for them, you have to earn them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3471.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3473.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a nice chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3475.36s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1741.197s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This sounds really interesting I'm curious about if this is common practice and other cities in the area I'm not I'm not familiar with this as a concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1749.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be curious to hear if other cities practices commonly and another thought I have and I don't think this necessarily is a deal breaker but if it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1759.005s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know what that would mean for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1760.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Prohibitive administratively for City Hall staff and what that would mean for requirements for maybe additional hiring or restructuring, or if that's just something to discuss in committee because I know the resolution says, you know, talk about it and planning and permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1775.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Obviously that would be the time to talk to City Hall staff, but that those are just things that come up and also things being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7403.057s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to make a statement about how I think that some of our intentions are to bring ideas to the floor in a regular meeting with the intention of then discussing them further in committee, which committee meetings are also public meetings open to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7422.895s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the idea there is there's just one agenda item that we can talk about more fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7427.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that what may be happening is that it's breeding uncertainty and confusion, which then makes people worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7437.842s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And for that reason, I'm not comfortable moving forward with this agenda, with this item tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7451.187s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Since we're in an open meeting right now, I'm comfortable speaking with the whole committee about this because we're allowed to all meet together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7458.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are not usually allowed to all speak together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7461.533s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's really difficult for us to kind of have these strategizing meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7465.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But something that we have spoken about is like, let's introduce something that we know would be something that maybe we've spoken about in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7473.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: campaigns or it's something that's a priority of ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7476.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we will start the conversation and then we'll move it to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7479.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And when we have committee meetings, it will be, we'll have more time to discuss things and we'll be able to hammer out the details without having private conversations that violate open meeting law, which is illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7493.465s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't wanna do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7494.446s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I think is happening by accident is we're drumming up fear in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7504.554s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think maybe what might be a better move for some things going forward would be to have a really clear objective that we can bring to regular meetings and then maybe amend on the floor or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7518.663s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7520.384s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just don't feel comfortable moving this to committee personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8766.395s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8767.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be possible to share the... Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8771.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be possible to share on the screen the chart that's on the next page of the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8778.647s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I am on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8780.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8784.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, I'm not on Zoom anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8786.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8788.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8790.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8795.021s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, well, we'll share it in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8804.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's an attachment to this rule change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8805.963s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I appreciate president bears reading the original rule because the thing that we changed is that we just changed the first sentence from five minutes to two minutes and added a sentence saying public participation shall not exceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8838.066s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: public participation shall not exceed 90 minutes per agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8841.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So during a single meeting, and we added additionally that interested parties can also contribute written comment on agenda items via an online form, which would mean that we would have to create that, that would imply that we would be adding that to our, the way that we, our methods of communication with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8861.651s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And a paper form in the office of the city clerk would also be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8867.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something that we would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8869.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's been a spill in the chambers, so I'm distracted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8874.374s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there are a lot of ways that people can contact the City Council right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8878.495s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is not a strategy to limit public participation so much as it's a way for us to carry on the business of the City Council, hear from people in a way that does not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8894.72s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is more efficient, more democratic and allows more people to feel comfortable speaking with city Councilors and making sure their voices are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8905.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something I wanted to mention at the beginning of my remarks is that the, the way that we operate in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8912.034s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: as a city council is that we're representative democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8915.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like we got voted in and we're supposed to be debating amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8918.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're never meant to be debating with the public because we would never have time to debate with every resident in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8925.219s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There just isn't time for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8927.3s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're not supposed to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8928.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're supposed to hear a specific period of time of public comment, and then we are supposed to debate together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8936.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: we're going to have to come to an agreement amongst ourselves and then land on a conclusion and take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8942.327s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, uh, this the goal of this resolution is to get us closer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8947.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reason I have this pulled up is because, uh, we did some research and we pulled up the cities surrounding our region<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8965.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One of the most permissive of the area for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8970.517s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many cities just have one section when I say public comment I mean that's one section of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8977.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would have an opportunity for the public to speak after every agenda item which only one other city has, which is revere and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8986.638s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: says a few minutes, it's like one to two minutes in the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8990.32s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But other all the other cities have one city, you have to be sponsored, many, you have to sign up in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8997.183s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if something triggers you that you're sitting in the chambers, and you say, Oh, that's interesting, I would want to speak on that you and you stand up and you say, No, you can't you have to sign up by like the Friday beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9011.407s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and have prepared remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9013.129s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So a lot of that stuff is very different in Medford and that's something we don't want to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9018.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's important to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9020.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the other thing to keep in mind is that there are opportunities to communicate with city councilors and integrate opinions of the public prior to city council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9036.246s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that I think are more effective at getting messages across that are not included in public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9045.028s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: For instance, I actually would like to make a motion to amend this resolution to be three minutes instead of two minutes based on feedback that I've received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9057.312s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's all I have to say for now, but I appreciate the support of Councilor Leming and Councilor Tseng as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11948.746s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So quick point of privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11950.087s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11951.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not for the council's comfort that we would like to offer this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11957.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's because two meetings ago, we had a very long public comment period after one agenda item and one member of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11967.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is an example, but this has happened, I think, to multiple people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11971.928s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the leaf blower ordinance was being voted on, and then he stood up and he said, Good morning, Councilors, because it was after midnight, and he had waited that whole time to talk about leaf blowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11982.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's for Norman, who waited to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11984.415s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not for us and for our comfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11986.817s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11987.637s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's for people who wait to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11990.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's so more people can speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11992.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12324.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a quick point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12326.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's no changes to anything about petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12329.792s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's all in the rules as they stand right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=12332.455s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The only changes are in the first paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15768.12s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15770.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15771.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the clarity of everything being called a resolution kind of lumps everything in together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15778.124s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it can, I think it's contributing to some of the confusion of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15782.605s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think having a new heading is really smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15787.967s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would support that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20241.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20243.098s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm going to do my best to go to the meeting at five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20245.299s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My daughter has gymnastics, of course, it'll be tight, but I'll do my best to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20249.901s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was the number one thing I ran on actually was funding the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20254.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I used to work for the superintendent and I worked closely with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20257.625s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My hesitation on the resolution is that I think that because of the specifics of how the school committee works with the superintendent and the mayor on the intricacies of their budget, we, and since our approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20272.011s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: know that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20272.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Procedure for it is really just about big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20275.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I knowing what I knew about how.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20279.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Stark the budget was every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20281.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I knew that I could do the most good by being able to make large structural changes that would bring in more revenue to the city, and that would then get funneled to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20291.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that for City Council, what we can do is stuff that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20299.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and that's what's gonna carry us forward and make larger changes that will then allow the schools to have some permanent shifts that will mean that every year you're not dealing with this in the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20315.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, it is like such a high priority for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20319.965s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's so important to me and I really look forward to that meeting and to hearing more about your concerns, please email me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20328.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20329.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can reach me on the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20329.868s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, you lose our at Medford dash and make dot org.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21986.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In my dreams, this is something that we would have ongoing as an ongoing thing into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21994.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think this is just a starting point, as we've talked about, just generating ideas and things we can discuss going forward, but meeting people where they are and hoping to get feedback before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=22010.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to make sure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=22011.044s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Items go to regular meetings so that we're not playing catch up, and we're generating some trust and connection with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=709.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thanks, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=711.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Leming, I appreciate this kind of sort of weeding through all of the line by line details of this kind of stuff is what really can pull out opportunities for funding that we wouldn't have necessarily known we were missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=729.492s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that's really important and exciting that we can utilize these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=736.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=737.517s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think you've done a lot of great work here and I don't have any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=740.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: any notes really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=742.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm excited to get going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1785.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sort of to piggyback off what President Bears was saying, there are a lot of rules that the state sets for elections that I think it's valuable for us to keep in mind that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1801.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I'm not sure it's as necessary for us to try to be purging the voter rolls as much as it is that we can, um, help voters who want to vote on the day that they're there, even if they may be inactive in that moment, but they're living in Medford and they, uh, are able to get a provisional ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1822.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, these are the things that I, I worked, I worked the polls in 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1826.029s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1828.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: observed a lot of that because a lot of people were very interested in voting at that time who may have been remiss on a few of their forms, but it was very important to them to vote in that election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1839.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I saw then when I was working there was that we had a lot of election workers kind of showing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1846.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was like the height of COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1848.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody had masks on and was sanitizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1850.615s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was like running back and forth and sanitizing everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1853.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was really amazing what our election workers were able to do and what our election staff was able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1860.056s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think if we can keep supporting this office, and this department, and this commission, then we can keep being able to pull that stuff off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1867.341s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I don't think that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1871.53s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are some things that happen at the state level, like what President Bears was talking about, where there are policies that, like, if you don't fill out your census, you get kind of, like, placed on a list, and then it's not as easy for you to vote in future elections, which I'm not sure that's something that we would, I mean, the lists get really funky and weird because of those policies, and I don't know that any of that is either here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1897.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But what we want to be able to do is say, our city is ready to deal with that craziness on the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1905.406s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the more ready we are, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1907.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the more support we can offer, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1909.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And pulling people off of the lists wouldn't be the highest priority, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2936.479s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was going to say a lot of what Vice President Collins did eventually say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2941.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that the crux of the issue is that we would hope that the Board of Health would be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2951.104s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to approve the majority of one day licenses, similar to what our surrounding cities have in their ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2958.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also, I just think there's, just browsing the ordinances, there just isn't enough specificity in there yet for us to make enough, draw enough conclusions about what is and isn't allowed, because there just isn't anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2981.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing is some of our local businesses have food trucks, and they may want to operate in the city as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2989.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think that's an exciting opportunity for them, and we wouldn't want to limit our organizations and our events from having something fun and exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3003.92s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think this is important for us to continue working through, and even though it can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3012.101s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: slow and frustrating that we carry on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3016.602s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would support Vice President Collins' suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=78.555s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, well, we discussed the wildlife feeding ordinance offered by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=85.457s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was something that was brought to her by constituents interested in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=91.118s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to move it out of committee at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=91.938s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We are protecting public health and community safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=94.0s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's appropriate for the committee, and we did not vote to move it out of committee at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=100.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The two motions that came out of this meeting were to refer this version of the ordinance to keep the law for legal review prior to our next meeting on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=116.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: re-circulate the document to relevant city staff, which it's been passed on now to the animal control officer, and we're going to keep this paper in committee for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1589.037s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are you able to explain the conditions that were offered by the Community Development Board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1332.708s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So every elected official has an obligation to tell their constituents what they're working on, and we have been kind of remiss in not carrying out that part of our job thus far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1346.631s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I would say about what happened last night is we voted on, so for example, about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1354.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1356.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would say last night at the meeting, we heard public comment and we voted to send the real estate transfer fee to the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1371.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: which is what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1374.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If that's what we, like, if that's the information that we were sharing in the newsletter, that's how I would present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1379.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But every government, every elected government official is sharing information with their constituents about what work they're performing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1386.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And constituents can be in favor of that work or not in favor of it in the same way that we would share information about like the vote to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1398.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in favor of a ceasefire, that then we shared a letter that we sent to our federal delegation that was then shared with President Biden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1408.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would just share it as like, this is what we voted on and this is what was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1413.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And these were the other things that happened during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1416.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We would just, I think that's how it would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1418.841s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And one of the reasons why we would have a rotating group of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1423.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm Councilors participating in this is so that it wouldn't really be editorialized, but it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1429.759s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not really something that you can editorialize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1431.481s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just kind of going through what we're what we're doing and how the votes went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1437.105s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If that clarifies things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1557.489s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One of the, I think one of the most important things that came out of the meeting last night to me was that a lot of people were uncertain about what was being discussed and there had been a lot of misinformation and rumors that had been going around misleading people and a lot of people were here because they were angry about something that was not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1578.087s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: was not true information about what we were going to be talking about, that I learned from talking to people after the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1585.309s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we could have avoided that if we had been already implementing something like this kind of system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1592.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we had already had stuff on social media that was clarifying the stuff, we could have headed off some of those misinterpretations of what we had been trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1601.886s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm really excited for this kind of process to avoid situations like that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1607.989s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also think that the short video format will be really good for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1612.971s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It'll catch people's attention and it'll be able to clarify things really quickly as you're like scrolling through and it's part of your day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1621.575s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Not everybody has like a big chunk of time to devote to learning about what's going on in city council or what's coming up in city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1631.741s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that is going to apply to their life, but they might have 30 seconds to see, oh, there's gonna be a discussion that's really important to me coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1641.526s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd like to be at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1643.147s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if it doesn't apply to them, or if it's something they already like the idea of, and they sort of trust us to go ahead, then they know about that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1651.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think all of these things are really important going forward, and it's just gonna help us all work together to make sure that we're doing things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1661.382s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: work for the most people possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2767.401s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2769.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I like where your head's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2772.743s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In the same way that we would want to have hard copies for people that aren't connected, we need to be thinking in a progressive way about folks that are connected in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2788.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just would want to say that if our content is going to be functionally similar<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2796.556s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and start with the newsletter content, I think maybe this meeting is gonna have to like top off with the newsletter and then we should come back to social media next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3005.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I feel like Councilor Tseng is taking on a lot of responsibility for these tasks, and I feel like it's a little unevenly distributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3013.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would you like to not have to do a direct social media policy, and maybe I could do it, and just put something together that we could review as a committee next time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3022.815s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd be happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3023.917s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'll motion that I can draft a social media policy for the committee to review at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3040.015s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Settle down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=0.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: public health and community safety committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=3.884s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The Medford City Council, March 12th, 2024, 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=9.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=24.128s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=26.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=28.851s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=30.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We just have one item on the agenda today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=32.753s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It is paper 23-449, a resolution to draft wildlife feeding ordinance brought by Vice President Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=43.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Vice President Collins, take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=55.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can now, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=598.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=602.347s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: have a couple of thoughts about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=605.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't mention specifically anything about just I imagine there could be the potential that somebody maybe loses a cat or a dog and might be trying to lure them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=620.453s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we might want to add maybe a sentence or two to the language saying that it's permissible for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=630.194s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something in there that includes something about that, like are cats and dogs considered wildlife?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=635.077s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe if we can speak to, again, city staff, we absolutely understand, and there's leeway for more time for them to respond to this, but if the animal control officer has any feedback about anything to do with maybe feral cats that we might have in the city, I know there's a practice of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=658.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: trapping feral cats in order to spay and neuter them, which may sort of, depending on how we are defining wildlife, we could probably just add a sentence that would say whether we want to include cats or dogs or not to the list here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=677.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We could amend it for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=680.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just something to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=681.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know if it's that much of an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=683.98s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We also have a nonprofit in Medford called Kitty Connection that does, I'm not sure if they do that work, but they do have like adoptable cats, and I think some of them may have been previously feral, so it might be something to look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=695.427s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any other comments from committee members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=699.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=856.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are there any other comments, Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=860.371s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you have anything else you want to add before I bring it to public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=955.084s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=955.964s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there anyone from the public who would like to speak on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=963.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seeing none, are there any motions on the floor to move this forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=973.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=974.598s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=997.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, on the motion of Vice President Collins to refer this paper to KP law prior to our next meeting, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1008.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1009.266s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Oh, actually, we have to do a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1155.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1157.159s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=249.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1073.235s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1076.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1079.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1081.52s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1598.361s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She doesn't have the stamina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2172.512s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2672.692s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do have a question about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2674.092s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can you explain to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2675.053s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because my understanding is from when I worked for the superintendent, we would occasionally get free cash allotments to the schools, but it would be at times that we couldn't anticipate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2686.377s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2688.118s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the current mayor and the prior mayor as well it would be like oh you're getting free cash you know uh ask for ask for what you need but it wouldn't have been budgeted by the school so sometimes free cash would just appear so if this fund is established and then funds that would have previously been in free cash would be part of this now part of this fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2720.748s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As is my understanding, the way it is right now, this council has nothing to say about how free cash is allocated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2725.609s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2726.649s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We do approve free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2732.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2734.431s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What is the difference between the way free cash is allocated and how a rainy day fund would be allocated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2755.538s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2756.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can just say that from the perspective of the city council my understanding is like our priorities, since we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2764.932s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: running for office have been, I've been very upfront about funding the schools as being one of my top priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2771.237s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's always been really important, you know, being, having a really transparent budget and making sure that we're prioritizing those things in the way that we are allocating funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2782.045s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if there's a mechanism for us to have more transparent access to funds and being able to authorize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2788.985s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: be able to allocate funds in a quicker manner than the way the free cash is authorized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2791.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's a benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2793.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But again, what we're what we would be approving here wouldn't be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2796.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Any allocation of any funds would only be the opportunity to maybe one day have quicker access to, uh, funds that would be able to be allocated to various city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2806.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Correct Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4212.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Forgive me, I'm a new councilor, so I didn't see the previous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4224.88s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wasn't part of the previous conversations about this, so forgive me if you've already answered some of these questions, but what is the mechanism for making sure that it's a specific business on the first floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4235.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are you able to verify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4250.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How are you able to verify who, what businesses come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4254.831s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is it definitely a daycare or is it preference for a daycare or is it daycare office gem exclusively?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4261.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you can speak to that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4286.253s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4286.594s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My only thought would be like a distinct preference for a business versus no business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4294.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4295.477s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=4296.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Otherwise I think this looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7898.13s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7899.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think that this matters because you're allowed to run for City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7904.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If you live in Medford whether you're a renter or a homeowner but I do own my home, and it keeps being brought up so I feel the need to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7912.143s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My mother was displaced from Medford a couple of years ago because she couldn't afford to buy a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7918.809s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And she couldn't afford her rent anymore in Medford so she moved to the North Shore, she was living in Medford to be close to me and close to my kids, and she was displaced because she couldn't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7929.281s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She's on a fixed income and she's retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7934.58s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I have experience with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7936.702s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know what it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7938.063s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also help run the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7944.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't have a warming center in Medford, but we have guests at the Malden Warming Center who are from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7951.714s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know at least two people who are from Medford, grew up here, went to high school here, and who have families here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7959.184s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: whose family had homes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7962.085s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And for various reasons, they became homeless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7965.206s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the executive director and I were talking this year about how there were so many new guests at the warming center this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7973.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I was asking him, what do you think is going on this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7975.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's different than last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7977.269s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The weather's not worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7978.309s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7980.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: doesn't seem significantly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7982.28s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wonder why there's so many new guests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7984.021s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he said, I really think it's the cost of living and the cost of housing in our region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7990.706s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's getting really expensive to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7999.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just think that the affordable housing issue is incredibly important to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8005.661s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's incredibly important that we continue to find diverse streams to continue to fund our, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8044.95s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8045.491s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You've been so horrible tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8047.973s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You've been so I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8055.179s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8062.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have run on a platform of affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8067.749s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Matt talked about this at the doors, Anna talked about it at the doors, and I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8071.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Justin did and Zach did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8073.553s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure if George did, but I know that we all ran on it and we won on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8077.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And this is important to us and we are going to fight for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8080.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we're gonna hear all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8082.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we're gonna respectfully hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=8084.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We always respectfully hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9397.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9398.204s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14951.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't need to repeat what you said it was just going to be the point of privilege just that this, this doesn't preclude any of the stuff that you mentioned we can do many things at the same time and our goal is always to try as many things as possible and this can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14967.289s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: something that specifically targets exactly what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14969.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We haven't established what it's going to be yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14972.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's only to open up the door to have more conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14975.254s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I love what you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14976.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would love for you to send me an email with links so that I can learn more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14982.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because I want to be learning more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14983.92s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like you have a lot of awesome ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14986.041s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'd love to talk more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14988.022s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But we're diversifying this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14990.744s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're talking about this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=14992.705s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not just this one it's a lot of different options, and it's not targeting anybody individually it's all different ways of doing this and we're trying to keep our, the way that we're approaching this as progressive as possible so that it's not, it's not targeting just people on the bottom, it's helping everybody and it's, and everybody's working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=143.663s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=144.924s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think my priorities are fairly self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=148.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's important to me that we make sure that baseline we're not losing any of our departments that serve the basic needs of our residents that are especially vulnerable to the rising cost of housing and the rising cost of living in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=168.666s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Medford, but also in Massachusetts and in the United States, there are rising levels of homelessness across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=178.451s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would love to see, in fact, increases to the budget and in our services that we offer to people dealing with housing insecurity, any kind of eviction protections, protections for people with low incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=198.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: and protections for people dealing with mental health and addiction issues, but short of increasing the budget, it's my highest priority that we not see any cuts to those departments, anything that would relate to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=214.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=216.311s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The school departments, I think I mentioned schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=219.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=220.654s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't bring my computer with me today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=223.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the school budget needs to see an increase and at least needs to not decrease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=230.781s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we're all most, I think most of us are in agreement about that, that the underfunding of Medford public schools is a pertinent issue and is something that is also one of my priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=245.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3687.358s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: From my own perspective, it's a little hard for me to process numbers in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3695.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in this situation with the screens this way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3697.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would it be okay if we could do it over email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3700.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is that a violation of OML?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3723.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That seems like too much time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=778.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=779.889s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for that summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=780.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was really helpful to hear everything laid out in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=784.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was just a question for the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=789.392s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Given the communication from the chief of staff, it sounds like because of the capital improvement planning process for this year, it sounds like maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=808.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: this is a one-year delay in that one portion, would that be something that we could have an understanding that that would maybe be something that we could just set aside for the first year, and then we could approve everything going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=819.795s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or on a yearly basis, we could sort of say, oh, there's one portion that we need to delay, and just an understanding that there may be various things that come up, but everything doesn't have to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=832.583s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's no penalty if something happens and we can't necessarily see everything as clear as day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=838.804s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not like we're doing taxes and you get audited and you have to pay a fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=845.386s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that understanding that we're all working together on trying to get the most transparent process possible and share all this information with the people of Medford so that there are no, it's not a surprise when we have the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=860.894s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: season upon us, that being the goal of everybody, then I wouldn't see any problem to understanding that something, especially in the first few years, may take a little bit longer or may have a couple of bumps in the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=875.411s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wouldn't anticipate that being an issue on my end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=14.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=16.278s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=18.64s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1248.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I think this is a great first step towards more environmentally appropriate behaviors across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1257.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And point of fact, I understand that the most environmentally conscientious way to take care of people's yards and what we do at my home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1268.8s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that I own, not that that has an impact on anything, but we don't rake the leaves, we just leave them, and my yard looks very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1278.186s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's better for the ecosystem and the plant life and the insects and the wildlife as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1284.689s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's always an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1288.071s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That being said, I look forward to hammering out the details of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1292.794s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, the word by word edits that we need to make to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1296.778s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that something that we can do piece by piece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1300.06s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have to make motions for each one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1301.702s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1304.56s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, I'm excited about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1305.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1307.162s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Especially I think the most significant one for the quality of life portion of it is one leaf blower operating on a property at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1316.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In my experience in West Bedford, what we have in the spring and fall is like four leaf blowers going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1323.497s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: at once, and it radiates in your skull, and it's very unpleasant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1329.043s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that'll be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1330.404s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, and thank you to former Council President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1337.171s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, yep, I'm a big supporter of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1341.154s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1785.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You could say operator, you could say responsible party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1790.485s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we should go with operator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4433.598s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=461.85s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1804.079s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: President Bears, are you able to answer questions if you know the answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1810.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do the firefighters have a contract right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1812.538s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Are they working with a contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1813.419s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My understanding is yes, there's a signed contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1815.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1817.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The change in the designation of the fire chief, what impact would it have on the rank and file firefighters, do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1841.41s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it wouldn't have an impact on anybody except for the fire chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1850.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My understanding is when everybody called out sick at the same time early this month, that since it's the fire department and there can still be fires and disruption and emergencies that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1864.635s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somebody will get called in to cover those shifts and those people that get called in get paid overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1873.717s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you know if that's true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1883.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My belief is that what happens is when you call in sick, then somebody who is not scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1889.602s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to work that shift comes in and fills in that shift but gets paid overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1895.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that is why it was so much more expensive during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1898.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what appeared to be a coordinated call out meant that it cost a significantly larger amount of money to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1908.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The reason I'm saying this in explicit terms is because I think most people in Medford wouldn't understand that to be the case because at most jobs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1917.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: if you're a shift worker, if you work in retail or restaurant, and you fill in for somebody, you just get paid normal wages that you would be paid on any other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1926.367s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But my understanding is that in the fire department, when you call at six, somebody else comes and fills in that position, but you get paid time and a half or double time something over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1937.511s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just want to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1938.572s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1941.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that there is a possibility that if a fire chief comes in who is from a different department, it would have to be somebody who has worked in a fire department and has that experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1953.839s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They would be maybe somebody that would say, oh, hey, maybe if everybody called out sick one day, that would be something that we would have to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1963.479s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that wouldn't be something I would be comfortable with happening on an ongoing basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1967.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe I wouldn't want everybody to then get paid overtime to make up a coordinated call out, even though we have a contract, even though it's not a strike, even though there is no, there does not seem to be an ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1984.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There doesn't seem to be any reason for that coordinated call out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1990.286s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, excuse me, no, no, you may not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=1993.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Alleged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2019.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What I'm saying is if there was a fire chief who was not part of civil service and who came in from an outside fire department, I believe that the likelihood of a situation like what happened earlier in February would be much less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2034.124s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would, if there's possibility for the administration to speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2042.765s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: if the administration could speak to that, I would appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2045.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just about the overtime issue is that if you can correct me if I was wrong about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2836.96s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, my question was if firefighters call out sick and somebody has to come in and fill in for the firefighters that are not in attendance, do the firefighters that have come in to fill in, they get paid overtime, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16300.843s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16301.724s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We met and discussed, um, uh, the governing agenda and what is, uh, will be part of our committee going forward this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16311.551s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, and took some extra time talking about, uh, potential, uh, Medford warming center and what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16319.176s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: sort of needs there are that have arisen in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16322.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I invited Pastor Jerry Whetstone to attend the meeting and he talked about what the Malden Warming Center, he's the executive director at the Malden Warming Center, and what he finds the needs in Malden to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16336.967s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we spoke with some members of the Medford Board of Health and Planning Department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16344.392s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: talk to just a preliminary discussion of what would be involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16348.115s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the next steps of that will be discussing space, and also the possibility of doing of exploring it as a joint regional project with Somerville, Arlington, other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16363.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, next steps for public health and community safety committee would be to talk about a wildlife feeding ordinance from Councilor or Council Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16377.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's on the, the next agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16381.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that's, that's it for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16906.084s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was just seconding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16907.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can I second from Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17857.553s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=468.925s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So as far as charter review, I think there's something to be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=472.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that the Charter Commission is interested in continuing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=476.788s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know they took a lot of votes recently among themselves about their stances on a few of the issues that they've wanted to review, and I think they're preparing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=491.906s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: their presentation and their final sort of stuff, but they weren't going to be able to present all of their final recommendations until the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=501.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's, you know, 10 months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=505.454s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think it would be beneficial for our committee to have kind of, to be working in tandem with them, like, you know, sort of developing our own thoughts and ideas at the same time, and then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=521.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: in some ways kind of acting as like a conference committee afterwards and combining ideas, taking some that might be recommendations from the commission and some from ours that make sense and presenting that all maybe to the state house after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=538.514s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just so that we're not wasting time, you know, trying to do everything one thing at a time, we can all be working at the same time towards the same goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=547.298s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I don't see why we wouldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=548.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=725.506s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What is the timeline right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=729.787s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we should move it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=731.888s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I motion that we should move it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=740.71s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there a- I don't know, maybe April even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=745.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, it does sound reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=748.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have time to do that in April?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=853.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I, can I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=858.468s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that we're saying a lot of the same things with different words, but when I said in tandem, I meant like, we can start working while they're still working, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=869.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, and since this stuff, this committee only meets once a month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=875.655s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: committee only meets once a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=877.196s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we're, you know, it's going to take a while, I think we should just get started with what we can get started on when we can, and then, you know, acknowledge that it's going to just take a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=887.865s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So yes, Councilman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=893.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1019.428s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1020.929s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really like the idea of communicating with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1026.094s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we can do it in conjunction with the mayor's office method of communication, not at the same time, but since we are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1034.762s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, we don't, we don't do the same thing as the mayor, just like what Councilor Tseng was saying, you know, we're, we're, we're working in tandem, but not doing the same things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1043.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it seems beneficial to me to be able to communicate in sort of a broad, um, generalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1051.169s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Manner sort of big picture stuff that we're working on what we have going on next, um, seems like based on what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1059.864s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It seems to me like what we're trying to address here isn't, sorry about my cat, what we're trying to address here isn't that we are trying to make up for people, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1075.73s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: trying to over-communicate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1076.951s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's that we don't have a newspaper in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1079.051s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's that we're trying to make sure people have a high-level understanding of what we're trying to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1085.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There seems to be maybe a lot of confusion on social media about what we do and how people can access information from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1097.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we can probably communicate high-level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1102.498s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: information to them in a way that's sort of similar to maybe the newsletter that the planning department puts out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1110.162s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They put out information about events related to planning and environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1114.484s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They put out information that's relevant to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1119.146s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's high level and it's visually interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1122.228s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1123.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: testament to how their office is able to thoughtfully communicate with their constituents in a way that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1131.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think we can do like that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1134.157s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really like the idea of both communicating on social media and also via the senior center newsletter, maybe just a link in the newsletter that people are already getting or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1145.846s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And rotating who is in charge of it, I also like that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1150.268s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Something low key that's not, it doesn't have to go into detail and it doesn't have to editorialize, I think is a really, I think that we can make this happen in a way that says like, you know, this vote was taken, this is what will happen next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1167.876s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Simplicity and high level communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1821.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1852.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wanted to say, after what Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, that it seemed like a good moment to mention that it sort of felt like a good bridge to the discussion of the diversity, equity, and inclusion conversation we were going to maybe get to at some point during this meeting, maybe today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1876.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But because if what we wanted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1882.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: With the understanding that not letting perfect be the enemy of good, that if we want to make sure that we're reaching everybody, even when there was a newspaper, that would have been maybe a barrier, that it would only be people that were subscribing to a newspaper that were able to access that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1899.135s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there would never be a situation where literally everybody would have access to information at the same level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1905.097s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that being said, I think we would be able to address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1909.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, the possibility that, uh, you know, maybe Francis would be able to tell us, like, how are people getting information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1918.143s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How are people best accessing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1922.893s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, public information about how they can, you know, find out what's happening in City Hall and how can we best access the people that need to hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1933.879s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, that's, there are resources that we have access to in the city that we can utilize for those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1940.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And maybe that can be a step one before we get into the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2414.425s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd love to just open this up for the committee to discuss possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2422.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I spoke with our diversity, equity and inclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2426.332s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My God, my I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2430.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Our diversity, equity and inclusion director a few times and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2439.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: she and I are both really excited about the prospect of talking about it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2446.547s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One thing I have thoughts and concerns about is how to do it with the knowledge that we are subject to open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2455.696s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I believe there's possibility that we could do it either in smaller groups or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2463.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Online or with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2467.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Council president, I know we don't have a city solicitor, but maybe we could do it with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2471.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: somebody from KP Law or just like an advisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2474.044s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wouldn't want to do it if it would cost us additional funds to like, you know, contract out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2481.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I do think that it would be really beneficial for us to utilize Director Nwaje because she is such a wonderful resource for us in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2492.21s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And because so much of our work has to do with the way that we relate to the people of Medford and the way that we interact with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2501.853s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, so, uh, I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback from the other, um, Councilors and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2511.144s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that's that's that's where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2674.806s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right, so my understanding of open meeting laws is if you're not discussing what's on an agenda, then you're not subject to open meeting laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2683.711s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess the only thing would be if somebody can monitor it and kind of keep you off the agenda, then you'd be OK, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2696.097s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's probably, if you do a very specific training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2701.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: then it doesn't have to touch anything that's pertinent to an agenda for that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2712.67s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You get to talk any time, I think, because you're the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2747.669s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, my internet connection is unstable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2751.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Did you say, are the training sessions people talking at the council, or is it interaction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2770.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that they would all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2773.539s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that probably what it would be would be different depending on what the topic is and what Director Nwaje would be bringing to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2784.35s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Based on my conversation with her, we were talking about different topics that would be pertinent to the time period that we would be having it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2794.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it could be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2798.666s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, every year there's something that kind of comes up, maybe something that's an issue that's prominent in in Medford, particularly during that time, maybe something that might have happened in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2810.66s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2813.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: really variable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2815.567s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think we could speak with her, or if she would be hiring somebody that would be coming in as like a like a special kind of training, it might be there's so many different ways to look at diversity, it could be disability, it could be, you know, mental illness, it could be like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2832.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh income diversity and it could be racial so there's there's or or sexuality or gender there's like a lot of different stuff that you would be doing and it could be like informational or it could be sort of like uh going through like um uh role playing so i i'm not sure i think there are a lot of different ways that it could be done okay thank you is there any public comment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3016.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Also, I don't think you can make motions, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3611.38s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we receive in place on file, does that mean we don't access it in committee anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3617.003s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or can we still access it in committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=0.629s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm going to call this meeting to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2.11s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we will do a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=9.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is a the February 13 2024 meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=17.4s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=21.683s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=26.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=39.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=41.437s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Five present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=45.259s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=48.72s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the first item on our agenda is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=54.321s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm just reviewing our 2024 2025 council governing agenda, which is just all of the papers that we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=66.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=69.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The other thing that is on this agenda is something that I was hoping to discuss today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=75.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I've invited a number of people here to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=79.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm hoping to discuss that first, which is the paper 24-023, which is a warming and or cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=95.914s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Then we will get to talking about the governing agenda after we review that if that's okay with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=100.958s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=104.42s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is that all right with the committee members if we talk about the warming center 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=109.524s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just because we have a bunch of guests here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=112.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so I'm just going to read through the resolution 1st, and then we will get to a couple of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=122.537s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: folks here to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=123.857s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, there was also Councilor Collins had something that she wanted to speak about the wildlife feeding ordinance, which is not officially on the agenda, but we're going to get there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=135.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Councilor Collins need not be concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=140.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, paper 24-023 warming cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness be it resolved that the Medford City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=151.218s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: By the Medford City Council, let the City of Medford explore the options, cost, and requirements to open a warming and cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in December 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=160.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite representatives from the administration, including the Board of Health, along with stakeholders in our community and in neighboring communities to attend meetings on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=173.92s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I thought we would dive right in and try to do this as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=178.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have some understanding of how long it can take to kind of gear up for something like this because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=187.014s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've worked with Pastor Jerry Whitestone who is in attendance at the Malden Warming Center for the past few years, and it can take some lead time and in anticipation of trying to get everything together by next winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=205.014s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd like to start talking about it as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=207.697s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, here with us today are Marianne O'Connor, who is one of our representatives from the Medford Board of Health, as well as Penny Funioli and Alicia La Gambina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=222.392s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Alicia hunt, who is from the planning department who I thought maybe couldn't be here, but maybe since we're on zoom and maybe basketball's canceled is able to be here, which is exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=234.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But just to give some background on some conversations I've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=238.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I spoke with a woman named Karen from Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=245.706s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville and Revere are two cities in our region that have recently opened warming centers by contracting with a nonprofit called Housing Families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=259.294s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they are using city buildings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=264.678s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: to have overnight warming centers during the months of January, February, March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=271.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think they both opened in, oh, Sophie Antoine is also here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=275.026s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=277.328s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Health equity coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=278.429s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nice to meet you, Sophie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=279.189s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have not met you in person yet, but thank you for being here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=284.657s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, both of those cities are using their public buildings and are contracting with housing and families, and the woman that I spoke with from Somerville said that she was interested in the possibility of a regional conversation with Medford for future years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=301.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=303.075s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: either, I don't think either Revere or Somerville is married to the model that they're using this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=311.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Revere last year used a different location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=313.921s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They used their senior center last year, which is also a city building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=319.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They faced a lot of resistance last year, so I think everybody's just kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=324.165s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: feeling their way through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=325.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can also say that the Malden Warming Center did a lot of feeling its way through the first three or four years of its existence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=334.528s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And a lot of the work that you do in this kind of space involves a little bit of trial and error and learning what works and what doesn't in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=346.091s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I would like to invite<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=350.967s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: First, if I can, Pastor Jerry Whetstone to speak just for a couple of minutes about maybe just to give us a little bit of background on the Malden Warming Center, how it started and you can just give us like a couple minutes of description of of what we do at the warming center and where the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=373.078s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh, this, this sort of being a high level conversation about, like, what the needs are in the region and, and where we came about, uh, where the warming center, um, began and where we are now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=385.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, then we can sort of start talking about how Medford can fit in that puzzle piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=396.273s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=740.584s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Pastor Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=741.465s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=742.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor LeMang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=986.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, there's also the, uh, uh, Malden recovery coaches are, um, they staff, uh, a portion of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=999.554s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So they're pretty employees and we'll have like two or three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1128.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If I could ask you, Councilor Leming, to pause on that question and redirect to Marianne O'Connor or Penny Funigalli to ask if you all could give us a little, or actually Alicia Lagumbina as well, if you all would maybe be able to address what I would describe as the needs of Medford residents that you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1153.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that you witness in, you know, sort of day-to-day interactions now and sort of what you generally tell them when you do refer people who are struggling with housing instability or eviction, things like that in the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1442.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Dennis anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1450.856s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1541.891s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I would definitely agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1543.352s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I can also say that in my experience in Malden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1552.149s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Everybody who's at the Malden Warming Center definitely didn't go to Malden High, but a lot of them did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1557.252s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And sometimes they know one of our volunteers who was a longtime high school principal at Malden High, and sometimes they know each other from when they went to high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1565.937s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I also spoke with one of our guests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1568.719s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1569.159s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I did check in last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1572.161s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he went to Medford High, and he was telling me about his house that he grew up in, that it was his parents' house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1580.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: where it was located, like across the street from St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1582.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clement's and what color it used to be and what color it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1586.25s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, he had roots in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1588.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, you know, it's like, well, he's in Malden now because that's where the warming center is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1593.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, you kind of wherever you grow up, you go to the place where the services are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1600.039s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, it's it's the responsibility and the duty of everybody in the region to be kind of working together and making sure that we're all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1610.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: doing the best we can for the people that are around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1615.11s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I wonder if, Marianne, if you might be able to speak to maybe a conversation that you had with Somerville about the possibility of a regional discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1629.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: None of this is really going to end up with us making any concrete<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1635.946s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, decisions tonight, but I am hoping for us to, like, begin a conversation and really, um, maybe hopefully, uh, I think the next step will be like a more solid, uh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1648.311s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the next conversation will be about what kind of space we might need or have access to, but, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1831.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It sounds like running out of ARPA funding is going to be a problem for everybody, everywhere, in a lot of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1839.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's going to be something to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1841.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm really happy to hear about the concept of state funding being more available for regional projects, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1849.099s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That sounds like a really good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1850.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And another thing to keep in mind is that definitely if people find out that something is one town over, but it's available and you don't have to show paperwork, that makes sure that you have a connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1861.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do know that there was a shelter in Cambridge that established a new rule at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1868.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a guest last year who was trying to get a little bit more of a solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1874.441s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: situation, Pastor Jerry, I'm not sure if you remember this, I think it was Mike, he was trying to get into one of the Cambridge shelters, but you needed like some kind of piece of mail that said that you lived in Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1886.145s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was like, but you're homeless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1888.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How do you have a piece of mail that says you live in Cambridge when you don't have a home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1891.947s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was like, he couldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1893.768s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it was like, you were supposed to prove residency, but you don't have residency anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1898.61s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But then it was like, well, I'll go to Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1902.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like I would happily go to Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1905.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Anyway, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2062.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Pastor Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2287.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2471.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I would agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2472.507s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I've thought about that as a bigger picture thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2474.988s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the issue with the warming center, from my perspective, is that it catches folks right before they hit the pavement as a final.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2490.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: uh last gasp so it's it's definitely not the safety net that everybody deserves but it can be the last catch um of course we also need all the layers of safety net um but the the least we can do is make sure that you're not freezing to death so as a first as a first thing that's kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2514.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's kind of the first thing I'm thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2515.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then we can start working on, you know, the Office of Housing Stability and making sure that we have like a fully staffed city hall that's that's like checking in on people and that, you know, you never end up getting evicted in the wintertime and having to go to a warming center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2534.174s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Maybe then we don't need a warming center like Pastor Jerry and I talk about sometimes where it's like, hey, maybe we just like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2540.532s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: make ourselves obsolete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2542.354s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So then we wouldn't even need to exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2545.998s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Alicia Hahn, I'd love to hear your perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2895.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Jerry and I were just laughing because the building that hosts the Worming Center in Malden is also a daycare during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2904.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we're familiar with that juggle and it's been challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2908.776s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And also that my kids go to an after school program that is also a daycare and is in a church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2916.618s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it is also a functioning church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2919.04s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And one of the people that goes to that church is the kitchen coordinator for the Malden Warming Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2923.364s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have many, we got our fingers in all the little pots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2931.591s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's a grace church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2935.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they're like not everything's falling apart over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2937.569s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, you know, it's like an absolute crisis everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2940.39s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Daycare is a big challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2942.15s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's another conversation for another probably city council meeting if I have anything to say about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2947.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2965.08s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Honestly, probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2966.001s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The requirements for a warming center are really pretty minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2970.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It doesn't, like the Malden Warming Center is probably more, it does more than it needs to because there's a full kitchen, but it just needs to be like a big room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3008.086s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3011.225s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I want to go to Alicia Lagumbina and then I want to stop because if I keep talking about this, I could talk about this for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3023.433s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I want to move on to one thing that Councilor Collins wanted to take off the table from the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3031.199s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Alicia Lagumbina and then I'm going to try to move on from this discussion and wrap it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3037.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yes, Alicia Lagumbina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3347.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3352.214s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3368.544s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, Councilor Lohmann, can you repeat that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3528.592s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you all so much for giving us so much of your time and sort of an overview of our situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3539.621s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think there's a lot more to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3543.024s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the Board of Health and the Planning Department does so much excellent work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3555.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I really, really appreciate your partnership as we began talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3560.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think it's something that's very important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3565.612s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's something that I'm probably going to harp on about for quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3568.996s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I apologize in advance for everybody to everybody forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3574.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think it's very, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3576.377s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3577.799s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate everything that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3579.681s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I really thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3581.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I hope that we can continue the conversation and make some progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3587.752s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3667.425s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that Councilor Collins has prepared some materials for taking something off of the table for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3675.791s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins, would you prefer to wait since it's already 8.15-ish or would you rather, would you like to wait or do you want to do it tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3733.686s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All right, let me so on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3736.188s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Is there a 2nd on Councilor Collins motion to keep this paper in committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3744.173s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to keep paper 240-010, I'm tired, it's been a long day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3755.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to keep paper 24-023 in committee, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3766.545s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3772.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3778.713s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3786.175s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3787.756s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3790.017s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So next, would we, okay, let's, I would like to, yeah, let's, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3796.839s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3802.861s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, let's go over the Council Governing Agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3809.385s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Paper 24-006, offered by President Bears, resolution that each Council Committee review the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda as amended in the committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3823.452s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, so we have a number of papers in committee, including<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3830.786s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One significant resolution to draft a wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3836.573s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we would like to discuss that, do we want to go through the other papers first, or do we want to just jump straight to that, Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3861.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are a number of sort of complicated ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3867.052s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So there's the replication ban ordinance, face surveillance ban ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3875.396s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's one that actually that I know that we will not be addressing until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3882.119s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: April, the, uh, Medford police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3886.523s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, oh, that's not even in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3888.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3890.127s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not even in here, so never mind if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3942.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3944.195s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to, probably best to discuss the new ones quickly if we'd like, and then maybe decide what the timeline would be for probably as many as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3965.778s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, Councilor Collins, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3968.5s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Actually, before we do that, though, yes, Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3986.291s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3987.131s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do I need to make you something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3992.335s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3993.475s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, you can screen share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4031.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, no, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4032.815s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Uh, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4033.815s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4034.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, I mean, full disclosure here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4035.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really was very focused on the warming center, um, discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4039.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And, um, so I'm happy for anybody else to take the steering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4044.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but, uh, but yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4048.68s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So let's, let's dive in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4051.161s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the focus of the public health and community safety committee, um, is emergency response, public health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4060.066s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The departments that are relevant are Health, Police, Fire, Building, DPW, and Civil Defense, so it does encompass a lot of significant departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4120.881s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the goal of that is to start talking about it as soon as possible and for it to pilot during next quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4131.486s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we just talked about that for an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4133.287s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We're going to not talk about it anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4136.469s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK, so alternative emergency response and civil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4258.957s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, we already covered the plant medicine decriminalization ordinance because we passed it on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4267.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right, Councilor Leming, would you like to speak to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4295.294s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have the overgrowth ordinance, which I believe was tabled at the last meeting but do we want to talk individual ordinances here or just kind of summarize, we can talk about individual ordinances Councilor Collins do you want to jump in on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4422.501s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, Councilor Tseng, would you like to speak to the gender affirming care and reproductive health care protection ordinances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4549.773s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4551.269s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, okay, uh, oversight and engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4553.99s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We have surveillance ordinance reporting, uh, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4692.51s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I do appreciate lofty goals, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4695.171s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I always appreciate big goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4701.994s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a comment from HSNO got slowed down when we had legal review it and there were conflicts in the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4712.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Emergency response equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4714.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry, HSNO, I'm not sure what that refers to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4717.12s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Director Hunt, would you like to speak on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4771.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4771.913s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, we appreciate being able to move things along in that manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4777.614s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent, that's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4778.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So maybe we'll keep, maybe we'll keep April, but maybe, maybe May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4784.741s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Collins and I will discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4788.265s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Emergency response equipment replacement with the lead Councilor TBD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4794.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would anybody have an interest in describing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4804.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: No takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4804.939s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All right, I'm just going to read through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4806.82s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Lead Councilor, it's TBD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4808.801s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Timeline, not a start until January 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4813.223s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Review capital plan for funding replacement of equipment for emergency responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4817.944s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's pretty self-explanatory and something to take up next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4822.446s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4827.449s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Probably, I would think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4828.95s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4830.17s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Um, but also, you know, the budget will most likely be in flux and different at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4837.033s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it'll probably be something that we'll be able to better assess closer to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4841.915s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 2025 trailers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4904.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4906.327s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4906.767s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4907.647s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Could you scroll up just a bit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4909.148s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4910.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4911.432s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4912.013s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then review relevant city ordinances and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4914.536s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4915.737s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4916.658s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, Councilor Collins, would you like to take that paper off of the table and address it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4924.566s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do you think that there's time or do you want to wait for our next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4959.821s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4960.241s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the plan being that we will review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4965.163s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Review it in committee at our next meeting, and then it can be voted out and move to the regular if if we decide to move it to the regular after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4975.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, that's a question on my on my behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4998.894s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4999.735s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5001.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5003.055s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, is there anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5005.837s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have any other discussion items?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5009.9s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5022.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5025.63s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5029.293s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Clerk, can you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5040.744s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That seems to be the practice that the other committees have been... Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5053.426s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's not going in the garbage forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5054.966s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just going to be placed on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5057.006s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can still see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5057.706s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5088.826s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, four yes, one absent, motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5092.309s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5095.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5098.574s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5136.301s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=120.538s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have nothing to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=121.318s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I thought that was beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=122.298s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=122.859s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm happy to be part of co-offering this to celebrate this Black History Month, and I'm happy to be part of a town that is historically a community that celebrates that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12539.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes, I had a meeting with Frances Nwaje.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12546.517s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Can we make an amendment to this that says designee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12550.159s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12550.499s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12552.961s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is Paige.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12556.283s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: She's lovely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12556.823s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was a really great conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12558.604s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just think it would be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12562.842s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: an absolute sort of bare minimum, one hour, twice a year, where we have a refresher, just maybe anything that might've come up in our interactions that could be something that we would be thinking about as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12580.008s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about what it would take for us to meet, to convene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12587.37s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would we be able to do it with open meeting laws being as they are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12592.572s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Would we have to do it in an open meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12594.633s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or would we be able to do a training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12596.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we would have to do a training here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12605.16s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We could do smaller groups separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12613.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be curious to hear about exemptions to open meeting law for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12618.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But either way, I am happy to refer this to the committee on resident services, probably, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12671.5s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12672.781s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I would motion to request that the clerk does that research, but also that we refer this to the resident services subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12735.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm amenable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12959.619s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will start by saying that I'm planning to refer this to the committee on public health and community safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12969.284s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have been emailing with our board of health folks with a number of stakeholders in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12981.55s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think the main concern, the main issue I anticipate is space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12987.518s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Somerville and Revere have both opened warming centers this winter, using a model that is based on the Malden Warming Center, which I help run in Malden, which is a nonprofit, but they use that sort of as a template.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13006.065s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And those cities, Somerville and Revere, have opened their centers by contracting with Housing Families, which is another nonprofit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13015.501s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the cities use city buildings and they pay housing families to operate the warming centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13023.747s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I spoke with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13029.232s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: a woman in Somerville who told me it costs them about $200,000 to contract housing families, and they use the armory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13038.974s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm trying to sort of figure out what the ballpark would be for Medford to run something like that for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13048.495s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But mostly what I want to do is figure out all of that in a committee meeting with all of the people that would be involved in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13057.785s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: making something like that happen, but I think the most critical thing for Medford will be space, and if we can find something that is either city-owned or affordable enough for us to make it happen, and if we have any kind of space in the budget, and I'm not sure if we do, or if we would need to do something where we try to just find a nonprofit or a church group that wants to try to run it for us, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13087.202s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The critical thing that I've observed from my work with unhoused adults in this region is that homelessness isn't a municipal issue, it's a regional issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13098.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So once you lose your housing, you're not considered a resident of anywhere anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13104.467s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You just kind of go where the services are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13106.807s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So you're not bound by the lines in a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13110.488s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I've had guests at the Malden Warming Center that I knew from Medford because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13117.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I knew them from town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13119.571s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I know that there is need in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13122.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know that we could help a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13124.212s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I know that we could partner with other folks in the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13128.534s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we could all do a lot of good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13131.215s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I look forward to having deeper conversations with people once we can spend more time in committee talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=788.559s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I support all of the requests for reports, just I would want to keep an eye toward not giving the city staff enough time to generate those reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=805.984s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's not overwhelming as we request them, just like with respect for how much work they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=814.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: have to put up to do those reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1924.862s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In addition to the ripping up the roads issue of public utility stuff, I think there's something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1932.503s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's a big concern about the functioning of the substances themselves, like the gas, the gas leaks, and various things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1946.231s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be very curious to keep track of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1951.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that everything is moving along properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1954.848s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I remember when I worked for Christine Barber, she was working on a gas leak spill and I was just trying to research if that ever passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1961.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was like 2017, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1961.937s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that Somerville at the time was one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1969.699s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: one of the municipalities that had the highest density of gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1973.181s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it was, what happened was some of the residents or every resident pays for the leaks that as the gas leaks, the rate payers pay for it, the utility doesn't pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1986.527s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the bill was to say, you know, fix the leaks obviously first, but also if you can't fix the leaks, you pay for the leaks and then the rate payers shouldn't pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1996.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The fact that that wasn't happening was utterly insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1999.029s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not even sure if it passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2000.049s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm still trying to research it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2001.43s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But, um, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2253.624s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't mean to interrupt you, but I do think that if we can, as this active council now sort of pick up the work that's been done without replicating it and carry it forward, I think that's really important and keep staying on top of the utility companies as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2272.839s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: as we move through this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2274.379s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2276.04s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd be happy to do that, or I don't know if Ken's script probably fills that part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2282.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You do have the institutional knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2284.242s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I'd be eager to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2288.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because I wouldn't want to waste the energy of like, if somebody's been doing it, and this kind of the double pole thing is already covered, and stuff that has been discussed is, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2325.721s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Right, like once people are just talking to each other, it's not, it doesn't need to be contentious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2330.922s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You can just give us the information you have and we can go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2334.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2440.089s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Did you have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2441.07s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Did you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2441.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do I need a motion to say that I and I would move to, let's see, I would move to lead the oversight and engagement of public utility accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2456.539s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: with Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2461.323s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2463.444s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2465.365s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I didn't, I don't know what it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2471.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Motion to co-lead the oversight and engagement of public utility accountability with Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=365.623s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: As far as the papers that are in committee from prior councils, prior years, how do they come forward to be discussed as part of this committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=425.856s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There is sort of an idea around the timing of things though, right, with the conversations we've been having about spreading stuff out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=437.844s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So do you have a thought in mind about how we should structure our kind of priorities for bringing up the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=448.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What I'm getting at is I would like to see the background on all of this stuff, all of the stuff from the stuff that's tabled or in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=457.355s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd like to see all the background on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=461.417s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I don't want to try to see everything immediately, especially as we have these, especially like the extended leave with illness bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=470.74s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know at the family medical leave being something that we're going to sort of think about talking about 2025, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=475.421s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=478.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Those are things that I think are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=482.389s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1298.288s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a procedural question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1299.549s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So do we need to do anything about the budget ordinance from this committee before it can go to the regular meeting on the 27th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1311.478s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is going to happen on February 27th again, and we'll talk about the budget ordinance, and then move it out, and then we'll talk about it in the regular meeting in March, probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1834.749s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was just seconding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2047.607s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would just say that it feels like everything follows from whatever that announcement is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2054.751s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, none of the rest of this stuff can happen until we have a clear timeline on a clear description of all of the larger amounts of money that may be coming down the pike for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2074.522s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think the greater transparency and the greater clarity we can have to share with the public, the sooner the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2081.768s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't, I feel like I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2084.77s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I feel like people, just general Medford residents aren't, don't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2091.515s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm eager, I'm excited and eager to hear more about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2095.018s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: When do you think that announcement will be made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2110.716s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2112.097s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=813.315s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, it occurs to me that a lot of the projects I've been thinking of in the public health and community safety are going to overlap a lot with resident services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=822.962s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I think it's probably just a matter of picking one that makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=826.745s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If somebody is interested, they're not on that committee, but they're interested in that particular issue, they come to that meeting, they can speak on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=834.851s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It may eventually, maybe it goes to committee of the whole after, would that be an option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=838.373s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=838.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=986.107s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: just this is just a procedural question but when uh if november 2024 so if the community benefits agreement ordinance the goal of is to start that november 2024 is the idea that you would present it to in a regular meeting around that time or or anytime<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1009.812s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then the idea being that that project can start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1012.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, for 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1012.954s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1013.234s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1152.531s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1155.012s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I also admire how many real already established ordinances are in that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1161.697s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I have a goal for the rest of the committees to look that way after this meeting, maybe, and maybe in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1170.543s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But that one seems really nicely like a benchmark for us, like a nice template for us to build on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2366.546s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm so eager to get started on working on these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2370.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2370.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The warming and cooling center in particular is something that's really important to me at a personal level, but I can say that the timeline in my mind would be to start talking to relevant parties after this winter is over and talk about implementing a process for next winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2390.535s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a question for the rest of the council about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2399.372s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: with a new major project that hasn't happened in the city yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2406.134s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: How, as far as proposing something like this, does it start with talking to appropriate department heads and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2420.345s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: landowners and stuff like that before you're making a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2426.508s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Or is it like, we're going to do this thing and then everything comes after that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2432.59s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know, like what's the order of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2532.902s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: President, yeah, I definitely wouldn't want to alienate or steamroll any of our partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2541.627s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that's a concern that I have when I'm trying to think through how best to manage estimating timelines for projects that, in a perfect world, we would be able to do as soon as humanly possible because there's needs right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2561.943s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I hesitate to talk to everybody that I could possibly talk to before doing anything real, but at the same time, you know, it's a balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2573.645s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, but anyway, all of this to say, I'm very excited to get moving on all of these projects and get to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2703.7s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, there's a model that's built a little bit around the way the Malden Warming Center operates, but is implemented in Revere and Somerville this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2716.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Both cities have contracted with Housing Families, which is a nonprofit, but they've basically laid the foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2724.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They're doing it in their public buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2728.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Revere is hosting it in the basement of their city hall, Somerville is using the armory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2737.611s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: they have contracted with housing families, so they pay them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2739.912s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I just need to, I, you know, like the fact that they've already sort of established some things with that, I think there's a lot of conversations that can be had, but it's probably, I think you're right, two pathways can put it on the agenda and also have the conversation, maybe invite folks since it's going to be on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2758.036s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then maybe so because it's not fully fleshed out, it goes to committee after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2762.678s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then we go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2951.121s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would love to have a conversation with them, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2955.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can talk about this offline, but if you have contact info.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3524.701s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I had a question about the water and sewer infrastructure in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3530.782s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know that it's bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3535.083s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I guess I'm curious about if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3542.608s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This might be just a conversation, not for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3547.056s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But there aren't, we don't really have anything on here about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3551.465s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: you know, looking into it carefully and like assess, I know, I happen to know two people in town who routinely have their basements flood, like atrociously flooded basements, like ruined everything over and over again, every time it rains in Medford and different parts of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3569.314s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And it's because of the infrastructure on those streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3573.216s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's just like not up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3574.616s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3577.137s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm curious about where sort of the city is, it seems like they're aware that it's a problem, if there's anything that we can do to nudge that along, or if there's something that I can suggest now that I'm seeing it laid out in front of me, it kind of occurs to me that that would be, this would be a place to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3769.798s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Does the continued existence of the private ways continue to cause a problem with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3775.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because, I mean, I know we have a huge percentage of private ways in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3779.641s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And are they less regulated still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3783.082s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3803.496s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can tell you for sure one is probably a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3805.577s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's in the Heights and the other is, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3809.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't think it's a private way, but it's it's down in West Medford by the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3884.272s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I live on a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=842.622s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wonder, Representative Donato, if you can speak to other similar shelters in different cities that have been set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=851.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I know this crisis has been going on for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=855.569s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Have there been other temporary shelters very short term like this that have been set up in other places?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=904.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=906.562s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: My question is about the five-day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=911.34s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: sort of ideal limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=915.384s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think with the way that housing and bureaucracy and the way these things tend to go, my suspicion is that sometimes people will be somewhere for a little bit longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=929.236s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And my concern about that isn't that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=933.424s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the migrants will be in this shelter for longer, but that if we have presented it as such a temporary location that we're making it harder for maybe students who do need to enroll, if they end up staying for longer and they're out of school as a result for a long time, I wouldn't want to give the impression that they're blocked from attending school if they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=959.665s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: stay for a while, if they're there for two or three months, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=963.706s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I don't know that that would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=965.907s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But in working with people who are trying to attain housing, often, even if you have something that's in the works, it takes a month just to roll over the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=977.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the last person to move out of somewhere, you know, like these things can kind of sometimes take time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=981.289s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I'm curious about, you may not know this, but I'm curious about Medford's understanding of how we can treat the folks that are staying there as though they're residents of Medford while they're residents of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1036.376s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1037.356s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2929.353s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2930.672s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: of information I spoke with the mayor's office they are they're doing some plumbing retrofitting and they will have bathrooms smart bathrooms built and I believe what happens is it'll be five days<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2946.653s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: her sort of family, and then they'll cycle through and it'll be the next group that will come in, it wouldn't be just open for five days, and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11520.687s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2220.796s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you and I appreciate everybody's flexibility with me being on zoom today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2227.462s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There are just two things I wanted to mention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2232.227s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This has been touched upon, but I think that the an important thing to acknowledge is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2239.594s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Many of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2241.114s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, I think all of us ran for office because of the value we have for the city and because we care a lot about our community, and because we have a certain level of love and care for our community members, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2259.648s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If these positions are all volunteer positions, it requires people to have enough personal income to not require an additional income source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2271.412s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And that requires a baseline level of income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2276.334s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I don't think that's representative of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2279.235s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I think we should just consider that one aspect of making sure that we're really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2286.718s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: having people representing the city that that truly represent the people that live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2291.744s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: The second thing I want to make note of is that just because other communities other surrounding communities are not paying their school committee members the same as they're paying their city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2303.337s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I would respectfully disagree with Councilor Scarpelli I worked as the executive assistant to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent for a few years and with not this current city council but a city council a couple of years ago, that was made up of many of the same folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2321.574s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And they work a tremendous amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2323.676s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They were incredibly hardworking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2325.977s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I can tell you because I had to go to all the meetings, and it was a lot of meetings, and there are a lot of subcommittees and Committee of the Whole meetings every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2334.443s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's, they're very hardworking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2337.685s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure how it was when Councilor Scarpelli was on the school committee, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2342.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will say that just because other communities aren't maybe necessarily doing the right thing by paying their school committee members the same that they're paying their city councilors doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2353.117s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think being a leader in a group is a great thing to be and leading the way and saying, hey, these two bodies are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2363.164s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: equivalent in the accomplishments and the work that they're doing, and that's something that we're acknowledging and valuing, then I think that's something that we can stand up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3799.337s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'd be happy to second this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3800.458s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would like to see the, I think, I just think I would want to see some clarity on the numbers a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3809.224s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3809.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm not sure why my, my computer's being fussy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3812.025s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3812.725s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would be happy to second this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3814.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I would just want the numbers to be a little bit more clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3817.628s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Like, would we take all of the dollar amounts of the city council salaries and the dollar amounts of the school committee salaries, even them all out for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3827.112s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then for next year and the year after and like, and then have them all be the same, but raise them up to the level of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3833.797s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: whatever it would land at with uh Councilor sang's final level and then we everybody would be even yeah i mean that sounds like the idea given i do not know that we can legally do that and even if we were to do that the money would not be in the schools because they're two different budgets right okay so this is my this is my hesitation i really like the idea though<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=944.483s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Lawrence Lepore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3221.128s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3222.088s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3222.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I really appreciate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3223.709s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think it's incredibly transparent and helpful for the public as Councilor Callahan mentioned one thought concern I have is that as a new Councilor, I'm not 100% clear on what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3239.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: what projects are gonna reveal themselves to me over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3242.662s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I guess if we have some kind of idea about how we can slide things in, move things around, sort of jigsaw our way through this as things come up, not necessarily on the scale of a pandemic, but maybe when we learn, when I start to learn more about how different departments work, how people are working together and where there's a space for something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3267.813s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: that may be a little bit urgent or not really, but that would be something that we would wanna work on, but maybe that I don't know before January 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3276.255s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3279.296s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I wanna be able to, you know, learn things as we're going and grow and change and have this be kind of a moving document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3289.479s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3290.26s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Otherwise, love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3291.22s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Love everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3981.198s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Just a quick question about all councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3986.863s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if you're not a voting member, can you help contribute to a quorum or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4000.439s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So you could just weigh in on something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4574.92s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4578.602s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you putting this on the agenda, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4584.269s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: One of my jobs right now, I'm the assistant director of the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal shelter in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4590.434s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's an overnight shelter for people who are unhoused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4594.238s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we are open from December 1 through March 30th yearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4599.262s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And I can also say that in November, we get a lot of people calling us saying, are you open yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4604.106s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Because it's cold in November too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4607.909s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We should be doing anything and everything that we can to make sure that people can stay in their homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4612.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: when it's cold out, it doesn't even have to be below freezing for people to face a lot of health issues from exposure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4620.423s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had a guest recently with, we're not a medical facility, we are run by volunteers and just people just with no training in any kind of medical things at the center that I work at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4634.887s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So when we have folks that have real medical issues, we frequently have to call ambulances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4639.829s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we have a guest who has COPD, and he, just because of exposure from being outside, goes to the hospital really frequently, has a lot of breathing problems just from being outside during the day, even on days when it's not that cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4650.593s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it really is very dangerous for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4652.333s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And if there is anything that we can do as a council, just small steps towards mitigating that for our residents, I think we should make sure that we're taking those steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4662.182s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate you putting it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4663.704s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I appreciate whatever the Board of Health can do, and this can be one thing in that direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4668.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4954.792s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Well, homelessness isn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4957.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It isn't a municipal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4961.023s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's like a regional issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4962.984s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it's hard to get numbers for how many people in a town are evicted, because when you need shelter, you go where the shelter is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4973.027s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So what I can say is some people are chronically homeless, and some people are homeless because they missed a payment, they had a short-term issue, or they were evicted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4988.308s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: because of an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4989.589s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We had one guest last year who was evicted because of an error and was stuck in the courts, but was fully evicted out of his home for the entire winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4997.052s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he's now in a home, but it took him the whole winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5001.193s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he had a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5002.734s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He went to work every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5004.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He dressed really beautifully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5005.275s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He worked at a clothing store in the Prudential building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5008.836s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he came every night that he could make it when he wasn't working too late to get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5013.908s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But he did not seem like a homeless person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5016.029s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: He was evicted because of an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5017.81s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And he, you know, like was evicted in the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5019.911s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it there are all different stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5021.952s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We don't like have that much data about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5023.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But it does happen really, pretty frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5025.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I think there isn't like, when there aren't people stopping you from doing something you just can still evict people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=11474.987s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=11475.267s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Before we turn it over to Emily, are there any comments from the council at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=11480.575s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=11481.436s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I will turn it over to Emily Ennis to just remind us where we are and what's before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12239.918s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: All right, please call the roll when you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10543.673s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So you have the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10544.774s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's similar to last year's, just updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10547.936s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I added on your desks, it's a fluid document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10553.6s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It had some new information that I was able to fill in since I wrote the report and put it in the folders and now it's today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10561.045s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the report or about the practice of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10567.295s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Attempting to keep track of the 501c3s that operate to benefit the schools in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10575.05s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10611.313s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, I can absolutely add you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10612.494s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: There's a section on the bottom for other organizations, and since CPAC doesn't fit exactly in with the first two, I can add it there on the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10623.046s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10694.349s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10695.069s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: In the same sense that every time somebody wants to distribute a flyer in the schools, they have to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10701.369s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: the approval of the superintendent, or they're not permitted to distribute the flyer, I can share with you whose updated financial information has been received by our office, and then you can do with it as a committee as you would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10717.839s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But the intention of the letter was to say that the form that requests financial information from the 501c3 organizations was sent out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10729.684s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Some responses were received, and this is the updated document as I have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10774.832s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's the intention this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10782.557s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'll let them know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10805.682s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have a response from the Brooks PTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10861.277s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Christine Patterson last year provided some links to trainings that are available at the Attorney General's website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10869.86s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I took those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10872.281s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's what I know about and I passed your, we had a meeting at the beginning of the summer and I passed your information along to Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10879.603s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I think the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10895.034s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And since the 501c3s are separate organizations, and I understand that the policy was written to promote transparency and collaboration between all of the organizations, but I think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10909.834s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: You may run into something where there just isn't really that much time for the public school district to be instructing separate fundraising organizations on how to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10923.059s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is not my office, I wouldn't do it, but that would be a suspicion that I would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=10927.701s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: However, if it is the policy, we should be doing it, so that is noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11069.258s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If we can do it over email just then then I can I would happily add or change or adjust fluid document always thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7723.783s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is a different list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7724.943s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This is not the 501c3s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7726.864s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I presented last time on the 501c3s that are registered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7730.305s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: This was a follow-up just because, yeah, the request was, so we see the 501c3s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7736.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: What about the student activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7737.168s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And we said, OK, we'll give you the student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7738.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So this is the rest of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7740.69s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we have, in a separate document, the 501c3s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7744.992s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then we have this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7745.892s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the organizations that are neither, we can't keep track of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7751.294s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: because they're not something that we're aware of, unless they tell us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7757.919s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But even then, we have no jurisdiction over them, so they can kind of just collect money and use it the way they want to, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7765.644s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: We can't really, we can't track them down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8622.739s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that would be, as I said when I presented in February, that will be done yearly in October, and I can pull the student activities, most updated student activities numbers as well together when I do that in October, if that's okay as an ongoing thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8642.948s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's on a spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8644.789s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8645.209s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Of the student activities or the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8680.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Yeah, well, or if they change leadership in the beginning of the year around September 1st, we'll give them time to settle and then get the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4816.407s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So I included an addendum document on your desks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4822.472s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we have been reaching out to all the 501c3 organizations that we're aware of and trying to keep track of everybody that is on file with the Attorney General's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4833.802s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4837.201s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: starting next year in October, a form will be distributed that I have created instead of kind of carrying over what was happening last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4845.385s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And then I'll report every February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4847.626s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But this is what we have so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4849.867s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It was being updated as of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4851.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So any questions you all have, I'm happy to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4900.196s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I have reached out to every 501c3 that I was able to find, either by word of mouth or via the Attorney General's website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4908.642s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If they're a genuine 501c3, they have to do their filings with the Attorney General, so all of that information is online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4915.707s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: If they're not, if they haven't applied to be a 501c3, which is a really complicated process, so it's possible that they are collecting money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4922.849s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: as an organization and giving to student activities for particular projects, but they may not be a true 501c3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4931.156s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So the things that I was able to find are listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4935.1s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But again, also, this report should sort of serve as an announcement that anybody who is raising money as a 501c3 should be reporting to me, and I'm the contact person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4944.448s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And the report also has my contact info, if they can let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4998.037s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: It's owner is a person who's outside of the school system, so I'm recreating a form that's gonna be within just the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5008.641s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So that form was sent out, and I received some of the things back from that form that were requested, but not always everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5016.665s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: And part of the reason for that, I think, is that it asked for a lot of heavily detailed stuff, and the people that do these are volunteers, but it doesn't mean that we can't access that information if they're a 501c3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5027.89s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: They do all their financial reporting to the Attorney General's office, and that's all public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5032.414s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So we do have access to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5035.376s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So everything isn't listed here, but I'm going to have a database, and it's kind of updated on an ongoing basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5042.162s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Additionally, every year a lot of these organizations change leadership, so that's why the reporting is going to happen every October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5047.986s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So it will always be kind of in flux.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5819.239s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I was just basing it on what I was, what I was told by other folks that knew about these organizations or things that seemed clearly connected to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5827.167s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Again, this is sort of an ongoing document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5829.469s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So if you know, so like I wouldn't have known that Medford Field of Dreams was connected to the schools and I guess that it wasn't, but I'm happy to add that and follow up with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5844.297s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I'm keeping the list whether they're collecting money or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5847.338s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But yeah, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5848.038s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I mean, I hope that this is sort of an announcement that if people do know about 501c3s or any of these listed that I didn't include that you think do a lot of work directly with the schools, please let me know and we can kind of collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5908.229s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But I didn't necessarily... It's a very long list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5910.509s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: So Mary Jo has its hundreds just at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6084.399s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: That's all the 501C3s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6151.366s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: I just wouldn't be able to contact them, because I don't know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6153.668s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: But if you know who they are, I'm happy to reach out.<br><br>
