    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1379.726s">[Cappucci]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4067.982s">[Cappucci]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4070.424s">[Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4071.564s">[Cappucci]</a>: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4075.526s">[Cappucci]</a>: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4082.67s">[Cappucci]</a>: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4093.997s">[Cappucci]</a>: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4098.24s">[Cappucci]</a>: Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4099.641s">[Cappucci]</a>: And under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4100.521s">[Cappucci]</a>: Constitution, there are laws that govern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4103.553s">[Cappucci]</a>: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4106.696s">[Cappucci]</a>: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4122.83s">[Cappucci]</a>: You're subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4129.494s">[Cappucci]</a>: impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4135.257s">[Cappucci]</a>: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4141.079s">[Cappucci]</a>: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4157.726s">[Cappucci]</a>: On the state level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4159.969s">[Cappucci]</a>: Among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4163.972s">[Cappucci]</a>: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4166.995s">[Cappucci]</a>: So the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4184.93s">[Cappucci]</a>: I don't think that for a city like Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4189.269s">[Cappucci]</a>: for a group like Safe Medford to come along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4192.273s">[Cappucci]</a>: And this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4198.641s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4205.28s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4223.562s">[Cappucci]</a>: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4230.808s">[Cappucci]</a>: And under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4242.417s">[Cappucci]</a>: I'll leave you with this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4245.779s">[Cappucci]</a>: Is Medford being a welcoming city by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4250.185s">[Cappucci]</a>: basically subverting the rule of U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4252.508s">[Cappucci]</a>: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4263.682s">[Cappucci]</a>: When a new resident or a new business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4266.145s">[Cappucci]</a>: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4274.934s">[Cappucci]</a>: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4281.921s">[Cappucci]</a>: Here are the city services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4283.043s">[Cappucci]</a>: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4286.106s">[Cappucci]</a>: That's a welcoming city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4288.688s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4289.861s">[Cappucci]</a>: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4295.566s">[Cappucci]</a>: Constitution is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4297.347s">[Cappucci]</a>: I beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4298.208s">[Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6048.013s">[Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6049.093s">[Cappucci]</a>: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6050.834s">[Cappucci]</a>: I'll try to be very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6053.156s">[Cappucci]</a>: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6057.776s">[Cappucci]</a>: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6061.039s">[Cappucci]</a>: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6064.783s">[Cappucci]</a>: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6082.819s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6088.844s">[Cappucci]</a>: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6106.377s">[Cappucci]</a>: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6113.289s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6116.115s">[Cappucci]</a>: I also want to address the point of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6118.937s">[Cappucci]</a>: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6129.246s">[Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with limited government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6132.328s">[Cappucci]</a>: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6137.933s">[Cappucci]</a>: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6145.038s">[Cappucci]</a>: In the current policy of not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6147.521s">[Cappucci]</a>: ask an immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6149.163s">[Cappucci]</a>: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6154.77s">[Cappucci]</a>: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6161.36s">[Cappucci]</a>: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6174.946s">[Cappucci]</a>: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6180.708s">[Cappucci]</a>: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6195.298s">[Cappucci]</a>: Massachusetts never<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6197.591s">[Cappucci]</a>: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6200.692s">[Cappucci]</a>: And I really don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6202.653s">[Cappucci]</a>: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6214.518s">[Cappucci]</a>: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6218.46s">[Cappucci]</a>: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6223.102s">[Cappucci]</a>: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6227.344s">[Cappucci]</a>: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6235.227s">[Cappucci]</a>: And those laws have to be respected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6237.288s">[Cappucci]</a>: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6241.963s">[Cappucci]</a>: to come to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6243.104s">[Cappucci]</a>: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6264.374s">[Cappucci]</a>: So it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6272.88s">[Cappucci]</a>: You're actually putting a target on their back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.122s">[Cappucci]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.703s">[Cappucci]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
