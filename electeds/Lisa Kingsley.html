<h2><a href="../2025-09-15_XXXXXX00138/2025-09-15_XXXXXX00138.html">Dr Lisa Kingsley</a></h2>
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=52.075s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=52.476s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=53.296s">My</a> name is Lisa Kingsley and I use the she series of pronouns and I am a candidate for Medford school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=60.302s">I'm</a> excited to be running.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=77.823s">So</a> I spent a lot of time thinking about this in preparation, and it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=81.986s">So</a> I'm going to give some caveats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=83.507s">For</a> breakfast, it's Goldilocks bagels. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=85.888s">And</a> I really like to try different things, but most frequently, it's something that involves lox. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=92.787s">Whether</a> or not it's a sandwich or a bagel with it, that's often my jam. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=97.991s">Semolina</a> is my favorite fancy occasion, don't get there enough and very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=104.116s">And</a> I always get a special because everything they do for specials I get excited about, so I don't have a standby. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=111.221s">And</a> then I think day to day, it's definitely Bob's. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=117.139s">And</a> their Alfredo pasta with broccolini and sausage is like a family go-to, and it has been for probably the whole 13 years we've lived in Medford.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=135.544s">That's</a> probably McMuffin, because it's closest to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=137.945s">So</a> it's the easiest to swing by. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=139.546s">And</a> then I get the Biggie breakfast sandwich, but I sub jalapeno cream cheese for regular cheese.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=147.94s">I</a> like food. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=148.581s">It's</a> a good fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=149.942s">I</a> like the question.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=164.291s">All</a> right, so it's been a journey, but a journey that's really centered around public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=171.116s">So</a> I started teaching in the South Bronx. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=174.017s">I</a> did the New York City Teaching Fellows. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=176.399s">So</a> it was an alternative certification program, which meant I was thrown into a classroom at age 23 with a theater major and was teaching self-contained special ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=186.286s">I</a> simultaneously got my master's degree in special education at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=190.474s">and</a> spent the next eight years teaching special ed in both New York and then the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=196.452s">which</a> I had moved to because I met my husband David while living in New York and the buses got really frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=200.995s">So</a> eventually one of us had to give and I fell in love with the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=205.839s">So</a> after that time in the classroom, I moved into administrative roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=211.002s">I</a> spent five years as a functional special ed director at Prospect Hill Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=216.066s">Then</a> I was principal of Curtis Tufts High School here in Medford, a role I was so excited to take on because it was a population of students that I loved working with and <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=225.733s">at</a> that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=226.215s">I'd</a> been living in Medford for <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=229.013s">five</a> years and it was home and I wanted the experience of getting to give back and work within a community I cared so much about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=237.976s">From</a> there, I worked in Malden as the district's director of therapeutic services in which I ran all of our subseparate special education programs that worked with students with emotional impairment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=249.419s">I</a> ran our hospital reentry program for students that were coming back from mental health hospitalizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=255.081s">And</a> I ran the high school alternative program <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=258.702s">kind</a> of a dropout prevention program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=261.165s">So</a> what I found in each of these roles, my individual efforts would have a limit of how effective they could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=269.093s">You</a> know, I would be able to make progress on a specific program, or I'd be able to improve, you know, the efficacy of a certain teacher, you know, I could make <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=279.138s">moves</a> within the given system, but sometimes the system itself needed to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=285.039s">And</a> it was that kind of desire to figure out how to be a systems-level leader and make more sustainable change that led me to go get my doctorate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=294.822s">So</a> I've spent the last three years at Harvard's Graduate School of Education earning this practitioner doctorate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=301.243s">So</a> I don't have a PhD. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=302.684s">I</a> have so much deep respect <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=304.564s">of</a> my colleagues that have spent the multiple years writing the dissertation and that are more researchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=310.268s">I</a> am a practitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=311.289s">So</a> I spent this three-year program, I got to take classes at the business school and the Kennedy School of Government and the law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=319.975s">So</a> really getting to put together some of these different threads to think through how they can be applied to a systems lens in education. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=328.13s">I</a> graduated in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=329.051s">I</a> still am looking to figure out where my permanent role will be after graduation, but <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=337.812s">Realizing</a> that this moment in Medford feels important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=341.836s">And</a> I have a certain set of skills and have been spending a lot of time thinking deeply how to improve schools in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=350.144s">And</a> like, I have three kids in Medford public schools and they're going to be there for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=355.048s">So</a> all of those things together led me to feel like this is the moment to throw my hat in the ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=361.354s">So</a> here I am.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=379.019s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=379.499s">So,</a> you know, there's a lot of things happening in the city in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=382.54s">And,</a> you know, there's a lot of candidates talking about that in, you know, the really largely the city council race. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=388.181s">But</a> for the school committee, it's a narrow job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=391.582s">The</a> role of the school committee is governance of the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=395.302s">So</a> setting and reviewing policy, setting priorities, approving the budget, you know, to ensure it's aligned with those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=402.804s">But</a> the other big and I might argue the most important role of the school committee is the hiring and supervision of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=411.271s">Well,</a> most of the time when a candidate is deciding if they're going to run or not, you don't know if you're going to have a superintendent search.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=420.197s">It's</a> very unusual to have an interim superintendent, so we absolutely know in this next term, a new permanent superintendent will be brought on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=429.722s">And</a> because of that, I believe this is the moment that my unique skill set is going to benefit, could potentially benefit the city the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=441.233s">I</a> hold my superintendent's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=443.495s">A</a> lot of the training that I did in this last three years was to prepare us to be superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=449.838s">Many</a> colleagues in my cohort are now serving as superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=453.501s">So</a> having somebody who kind of understands the role, deeply involved in this selection process, I think is really important and I hope is something I will be able to do as a member of the school committee.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=518.166s">Yeah,</a> so one of the things that I think you mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=521.538s">And</a> that question, you know, we passed the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=523.759s">There</a> will be different budget funding coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=528.042s">And</a> as we look at how to use our resources, we have to have some guiding kind of North Star, some plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=535.807s">So</a> two of the things that I would want to prioritize before we even think about the how, is setting what our goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=543.812s">So</a> right now, the district has begun working on a vision for effective instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=550.512s">You</a> know, Dr. Galussi shared it at the beginning of the year in her family email, and it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=555.693s">It's</a> exactly the work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=558.534s">We</a> can go further with that and make sure that that vision is pretty clear and specific and is something that we've shared with families and something that hasn't accompanied, like, look for what does this mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=569.816s">You</a> know, there's a lot of really good priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=573.537s">And</a> then what does that mean in practice for us in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=577.02s">Like</a> some districts go all in on personalized learning, and that's how they seek to create more equitable environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=584.505s">Some</a> districts go all in on project-based that allow students, you know, these different hooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=589.949s">Whichever</a> way we decide to go about it, we need as a city and as a district to set that vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=598.305s">But</a> that vision is just like a poster on the wall if we don't also have a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=603.627s">And</a> right now, that's an area that we don't yet have as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=608.148s">And</a> I don't know how we can effectively make consistent and equitable choices regarding how we're spending our money, how we're allocating our money, what are we funding if we haven't set our priorities and if we haven't created a plan for how we move from A to B. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=627.27s">So</a> that's kind of the underpinnings that I think are necessary in order for us to ensure we are moving towards more equitable outcomes for all students.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=650.263s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=650.723s">So</a> I think that particularly when it comes to special education, <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=655.917s">It</a> is such a complicated and complex topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=659.321s">I</a> have run a whole lot of IEP meetings in my day and I've trained a whole lot of people whose job it is to run IEP meetings, but I've also sat in the parent seat of the IEP table. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=673.598s">I</a> have both <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=675.889s">both</a> in my home and in my family, but I also serve as a special education surrogate parent for students that are in state custody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=684.053s">Because</a> again, having this specialized knowledge, I want to use it to help ensure more students are getting what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=689.695s">And</a> we are not alone as a district to take kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=696.693s">I</a> fear we take too much of a compliance stance when it comes to special education, and that our parents don't always get brought into the process with a partnership lens, and instead it can too often feel like a checklist, it can too often feel like we are, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=715.824s">prioritizing</a> forms instead of real instructional conversations about students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=720.87s">And</a> that's certainly not across the board, but systemically, the amount of families I've talked to over the past 10 years, somebody finds out I'm in special ed, and then this becomes what our discussions are about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=733.524s">I</a> really do believe that that's an area that we <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=736.747s">can</a> improve and that that we can set some goals around because as school committee member I wouldn't be the one to decide you know what those improvements look like but as part of our superintendent goal setting as part of our hiring we set that as a priority that then allows our superintendent to address it because you know we are as school committee members not going to <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=759.887s">do</a> the management, but we're going to do the governance and help ensure that people are prioritizing what we feel is important.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=806.307s">Yeah,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=807.323s">I</a> mean, the most honest answer when I think about what's happening nationally is how grateful I am to live in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=814.192s">So</a> I in the last three years through my doctoral program I was working with school leaders I worked at a bunch of like national institutes and was were was. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=823.163s">coaching</a> school leaders from around the country, many of whom are from like Texas and Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=828.108s">And</a> when they described what their day-to-day life looked like in terms of the words they had to avoid saying that they had teachers in their building that were like waiting for them to say things they're not supposed to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=840.241s">I</a> was so grateful that that was unfamiliar to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=845.059s">And</a> so I want to further lean in to who we can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=850.841s">You</a> know, how I think it applies to Medford is I'm grateful we don't have those constraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=855.043s">How</a> can we be the best version of ourselves given that we don't have those constraints? <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=862.305s">I</a> think one of the things that happens is when school districts are told <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=867.779s">you</a> can't do this, you have to do this, you must look back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=870.14s">They</a> lose their ability to really effectively be responsive to their communities, and they lose their ability to really be responsive to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=878.823s">And</a> that's an area that I care really deeply about, and I think we can lean in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=883.165s">We</a> are allowed to have the tough conversations, so we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=886.847s">We</a> can bring up the messy challenges with our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=891.769s">We</a> can be honest with our families and seek their expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=895.33s">about</a> what our growing edges are and where we can move forward or where we want input. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=900.393s">We</a> can do that here, so let's do it and let's do it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=904.416s">And</a> I think that is a way that we can, at least on a local level, represent something different than what some of our colleagues in other states and districts aren't able to do.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=941.108s">Yeah,</a> I am trying to talk to as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=944.529s">One</a> of the benefits of really liking to talk about schools, if you haven't noticed from already our conversation thus far, I can do this all day, is for the last 12 years of living in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=957.977s">many</a> conversations I find myself in at Spotlight, on the soccer field, standing, waiting for a student at pickup becomes about schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=967.664s">And</a> sometimes they're about things that are going really, really well and how we're so excited about things happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=973.067s">And</a> as we know as human nature, sometimes the things people wanna talk about are the things that they're struggling with with the districts or frustration that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=981.613s">So</a> I am lucky enough to have entered <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=984.775s">this</a> race, with these conversations, you know, under my belt and these conversations being things that I thought of, I also was a principal in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=995.438s">So</a> I had the experience of working on two administrative teams, the Curtis Tufts, I was a secondary principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1002.779s">So</a> I got to, you know, work and collaborate with the other principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1007.04s">But</a> I also was a special ed administrator. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1009.721s">So</a> I got to work with and collaborate and be a part of the special ed administrative
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1015.894s">So</a> I had information about areas in which I knew we might want to continue to attend to or, you know, to work on, but I'm doing my best right now to talk to as many people as possible to further understand in 2025 right now what are priorities for our community, for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1037.033s">So</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1042.409s">I'm</a> running independently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1043.81s">I'm</a> figuring this out as I go, which is probably eminent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1048.192s">I've</a> never done this before, but I am going to doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1052.814s">I've</a> had some wonderful community members host meet and greets and been able to talk to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1058.316s">I'm</a> so grateful when folks are willing to share with me what they're excited about in our schools, what their concerns are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1064.639s">And</a> I'm using that to help inform. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1068.093s">I</a> think the most important thing we need to do with that information is to put it into our conversations about the strategic plan and put it into our conversations about our next permanent superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1079.987s">So</a> what I'm trying to do now is what I would like to more formally do <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1084.769s">If</a> I, you know, have the privilege of being elected to school committee, I would want to make sure we bring in the community to really help us set and identify priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1095.643s">And</a> I would want to make sure that we collect a lot of data, you know, to make sure that we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1101.29s">A</a> robust process of that to be to be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1103.991s">So</a> it's not just a few of the most vocal voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1106.632s">It's</a> not just my own personal experience, but we really have a deep representative sample of our community to help us make some of those really important decisions that will be coming up in this term.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1183.519s">Oh,</a> Danielle, you're reading my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1185.38s">When</a> you said the like, come to us for the feedback, what stands out to me is no, we got to go to them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1191.245s">And</a> it's about creating a myriad of opportunities, a myriad of methods, being comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1198.61s">I</a> said data before, and it's probably worth explaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1202.313s">I</a> don't just mean quantitative survey data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1205.035s">We</a> should do some of that, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1206.457s">Survey</a> response rates are historically really low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1209.522s">And</a> part of what I've learned about as I'm thinking through how to be more equitable and how to be more family and community focused is the idea of street data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1220.137s">Going</a> and having conversations with people and documenting those conversations, that's street data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1225.381s">Going</a> and watching what drop-off and pickup looks like at some of the schools, going and just grabbing people, how's this going? <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1231.586s">That's</a> street data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1232.507s">Now,</a> you shouldn't only have quantitative and you shouldn't only have street data, but if we can show our community as a school district, if we can open the doors and make the process not cumbersome to give feedback <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1248.159s">if</a> we can show like we actually really, really care what it is that you say. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1252.843s">And</a> not only that, here's what we're gonna do with the information when you give it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1257.266s">I</a> think too often in all walks of life, when we're asked to like fill out a survey or participate in a forum or participate in some sort of focus group, you don't get the feedback afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1268.555s">You</a> don't know what they did with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1270.376s">And</a> as a district, I think we need to commit to, if we do this deep selection process, <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1277.008s">or</a> if we do this deep data gathering process to help us inform priorities for the superintendent selection, we need to be reporting out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1287.174s">We</a> need to keep the community along with us, to keep them interested, to see and be transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1292.837s">Say</a> we've spoken to this many families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1295.459s">We</a> now want to speak to this many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1297.72s">Our</a> goal is to have X amount of voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1301.061s">included.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1301.602s">And</a> then once we do all that, we share the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1305.506s">We</a> go to people and we say, hey, these are the five priorities and some people mentioned this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1310.752s">And</a> we're not afraid to be transparent with what our findings are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1314.816s">And</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1317.16s">even</a> though that happens on the back end of this process, if we start doing that with regularity as a district, and probably as a town in general, but definitely as a district, because I'm narrowly focused on schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1330.246s">If</a> we start doing that regularly, then people will be more willing to engage in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1336.649s">They'll</a> take time out of their busy days, out of their family dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1339.69s">Like</a> I have three little kids, it can be really busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1343.812s">And</a> if I feel like I am, <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1347.287s">participating</a> in something that isn't impactful, like I probably won't keep doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1352.97s">So</a> I think that's a way, a commitment and a practice and a transparency and a consistency will help increase our engagement overall.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1374.957s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1375.857s">So</a> there's two things that are on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1378.498s">One</a> is for myself, and one is for a different community organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1382.219s">So</a> I have been on the board of the Medford Family Network for the last four years, and we are currently trying to recruit new board members for both the Medford Family Network <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1393.841s">and</a> for the Friends of the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1398.065s">Both</a> of the organizations meet once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1402.068s">The</a> Friends is the fundraising arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1404.05s">The</a> Parent Advisory Board does advising and programming and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1408.895s">So</a> if anyone listening is interested in either of those boards, reach out, reach out to me, reach out to the MFN, reach out to Marie Cassidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1418.917s">So</a> that's one of my plugs for just greater community involvement in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1423.418s">That</a> role has been really, really important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1426.658s">And</a> we wanna make sure that we have more and more families continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1431.959s">And</a> then a little bit more selfish answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1434.319s">I</a> have a couple of meet and greets coming up <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1438.182s">I</a> think from when this airs, the next one will be at Colleen's, who has so generously donated their space to all of the candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1447.226s">My</a> meet and greet at Colleen's is on September 25th, it's a Thursday, and I'll be there from six to eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1456.11s">So</a> that would be a wonderful opportunity to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1459.351s">There's</a> a few other events that we're trying to put together, but I'll repeat, I'm new at this, I'm figuring it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1466.343s">So</a> I have a website in which I try really hard to keep updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1472.063s">And</a> then the other thing I'll say is if you wanna hear more about kind of my thoughts on things in that, please reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1479.428s">I'd</a> love to have a conversation, but I've also been recording some videos with my kids who are fantastic interviewers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1486.073s">Danielle,</a> they're not quite as professional as you, but they're trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1490.656s">And</a> so both on my campaign Facebook page, which is Lisa Kingsley for Medford School Committee and electlisakingsley.com, you can hear us talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1499.882s">through</a> more elements of my platform in a way that maybe is a little, uh, engaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1505.146s">My</a> son is pretty phenomenal at Canva and he's created a bunch of graphics.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1527.535s">No,</a> I mean, I want to say I love talking about schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1532.742s">I've</a> spent a really long time studying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1535.346s">And</a> then, of course, I lived it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1536.347s">This</a> was my career for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1538.33s">But</a> I also want to just make sure I take the time to mention how much I love Medford and how much I <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1545.208s">I</a> lead a Girl Scout troop for the last five years and coach girls on the run. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1549.609s">And</a> I've worked at the swap, which is like my favorite day of the year, three days of the year for the last decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1556.751s">And</a> I just really feel so grateful that my family landed in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1562.212s">And</a> man, it would be exciting to get to put some of this specialized knowledge to use in service of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1570.774s">But</a> I just want to make sure that I end on this gratitude for <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1575.317s">where</a> we live, the community we get to be a part of, the fact that this process exists, the fact that, Danielle, you do this podcast and are working to get the information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1584.462s">I</a> just think we live in a really special place.
 <p>[Lisa Kingsley]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1595.008s">Yeah,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XXXXXX00138&t=1595.948s">It</a> was a pleasure talking to you.
