    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3175.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3177.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I live at 146 Pine Ridge Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3180.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good evening, members of the City Council Governance Committee, Chair Tseng, fellow members of the Charter Review Committee, and Medford community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3189.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, I served on the school committee for 32 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3192.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked to be appointed to the Charter Review Committee when I realized there was no one with school committee experience on the Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3201.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While some of my former school committee colleagues may not agree with what we have put forth in the draft,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3206.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that you are reviewing tonight, rest assured that it has been put forth with deep reflection, not only my own, but with the very diligent subcommittee and the entire Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3221.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As someone who served with three different mayors, I strongly advocated for the mayor, whoever it might be, to remain as the school committee chair because the advantages are so strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3234.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a school committee member, I had access to the mayor at every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3240.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not just me, every school committee member had the advantage of being able to discuss key educational issues in front of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3251.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: being present at the school committee meetings ensures that the mayor is familiar with all the issues in detail and has buy-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3261.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our charter subcommittee interviewed all three mayors and each underscored how important it has been or is for them to fully comprehend school committee issues, our school issues, especially given the significant percentage of the budget which is spent on education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3281.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember the frustration of my colleagues across the aisle, that is you, the city council members, in former years when mayors did not come before them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3292.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You never heard that from school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3295.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We worked closely with the mayors and they had buy-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3299.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To my former colleagues eager to do away with the role of the mayor as the chair of the school committee, I can only say be careful what you ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3308.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee members play a very vital role in supporting all students and education, and that is enhanced when the mayor who recommends the budget is not distanced from the intricacy of the issues that become before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3323.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Remember, the mayor only gets one vote, not more, not less, than any other member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3333.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Later, I hope to perhaps address some of the other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7316.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to address this issue of the autonomy of the school committee to pick their own officers or how that's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7323.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will tell you that this comes from my long years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7328.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that I understand is that power is just so sweet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7335.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you would, I have seen that selection process happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7340.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have seen very, very good people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7343.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who then decided they wanted to keep on being and locking out other members from getting an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7351.716s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important that members of the body have an opportunity to be either, which now would be the chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7368.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would, that part of this comes from trying not to prevent fiefdoms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7373.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, in the original charter, when I went to look at it, there was practically nothing about the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7382.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in this charter, there's not as much as I would like, quite honestly, because at the recommendation of the Collins Center, quite a bit was taken out that we had talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7394.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While I certainly understand the argument of having the body be autonomous and make their own decisions, I've also seen the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7403.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to look at both positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7406.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we're talking about chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7410.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the secretary role includes signing the bills on behalf of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7417.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the current structure that we use in Medford is the secretary of the school committee signs the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7424.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And once upon a time, I signed the bills for 10 years in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7432.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is a damn good thing that I'm honest, because nobody should have ever possibly wanted me to sign the bills for 10 years in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7442.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, I definitely invited my colleagues in and said, please take a look at what I'm doing, because I want to make sure that somebody else has eyes on this besides me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7452.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is not always a popular position because it takes time, but there is also an added stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7459.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there are added stipends for the position of what used to be vice chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7468.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, I saw the recommendations that I think Councilor Bears put out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7474.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's significant money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7475.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it was like an $8,000 stipend for these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7482.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am wanting members to have the opportunity to do these different roles and not just keep it so that one person develops power and fiefdom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7495.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if you read it, a key word is consecutive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7500.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't say you can only do it once when we wrote this language and you don't get to do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7505.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just said you can't do it consecutively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7508.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you can do it in, you could be the chair in year one, year three, year five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7514.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could be the secretary then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7516.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could alternate those two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7518.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's far from perfect, but I think it's better than not saying anything at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7525.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is the thinking behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7526.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the rationale as we spoke on the committee of saying, look, do we put this in now personally, and maybe it's my mistake because I didn't catch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7536.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't think about it, I have experience as a school committee member, not as a city Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7541.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because quite honestly, I think you guys ought to rotate your chair, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7544.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't like the idea of having one person be the chair every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7548.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd much rather see it rotate around members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7552.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that isn't to say that I don't want to see Council Bears not be the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm happy if he's chair one, three and five or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7563.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You get my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7564.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't think that one person in our city government should have a lock on these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7570.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important to let other members have a chance to get the experience of leading and being in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7579.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's where it comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7601.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I need to take a look because it was originally that's what our discussion was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7607.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The intent of being is that it would just, you know, because every two years you've got different people on the committee anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7615.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's change, you know, so, but the idea was that not one person wouldn't have a lock on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7622.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7658.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well then don't put anything in the jar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7660.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, that's always a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7664.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, the, I don't, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7670.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: how else to go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7672.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand people don't necessarily agree with me, but some of those people may be the same people who have a lock on positions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7680.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know if that's true or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7681.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7683.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm just saying that for me, I am looking at not creating fiefdoms of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7689.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm looking at ways of giving other members opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7694.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7696.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, it's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2355.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2801.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4637.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10096.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Councilor Tseng, did you want me to go ahead to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10107.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think we certainly considered all the different options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10112.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We were concerned that not everybody, you know, if we looked over historically at where school committee members, what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10123.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: uh wards they had lived in and we we were concerned in and and the way that our particular uh city there um we don't have a school in each ward so we were looking at school placements and how that worked and it it doesn't really correspond in any way and we were concerned i mean um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10146.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes there aren't that many people interested in running for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10151.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very taxing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10154.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It takes a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10156.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, the stipends were always considerably lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10160.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want someone running for position just because they want to collect the stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10166.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so after we discussed all of the different options, and then we started trying to say, well, if we were doing ward representation, what would happen if we had wards where no one wanted to be on the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10180.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10184.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, after many different looking at this, this to us seemed to be an opportunity to certainly increase representation from different districts in the city, but also minimize other potential problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10681.716s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13173.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13175.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Councilor Tseng, I just wanted to come back for just a second to say I became a little nervous as I was listening to the discussion that all of a sudden the comparison was to what the school committee subcommittee proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13188.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in our particular part of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13191.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is different than what was proposed for city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13197.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was because we did see that there was different roles and really in some ways different populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13208.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to say that I came slowly toward representation, but ultimately voted and supported it because as a member of the committee, and having attended many of the information sessions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13224.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and listening to people and talking to people in other communities, as well as having the discussions that we'll talk more about in terms specifically about the school committee, I heard from our citizens a great interest in having ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13243.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, and as I served on the committee, you know, you could go nuts doing this because there's always one more thing you can do and one more thing and make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13255.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I absolutely believe that we're really all interested here in trying to come up with a good, positive solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13265.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we all understand that it's really time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13269.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13271.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the weighing between how much do we go back to the drawing board and do another something and another something and how much we move is, you know, the question is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13284.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to let the committee know that I came to appreciate ward representation, even though as someone who had ran and served our city for a long time, I loved representing the whole city, but there was much to be said for those other discussions and I don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13300.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the fact that we chose something different to put forward to you for the school committee to hamper the discussion or make anybody think that I was not a proponent for what the committee put forth overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13316.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8453.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm here tonight and I've lost Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8456.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on behalf of Melanie McLaughlin, and also former school committee members, Sharon Hayes, Mia Masone, and Kathy Kreatz, we're all here tonight with you, Superintendent, to thank you and to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8472.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: give you our profound thanks for the seven years that you've given to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8477.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I was on the committee when you joined us in a rather difficult time, and it was so wonderful to have your enthusiasm and your joy and the sense of pride in Medford and in our students and just excitement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8498.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Former athletic coach, and some of you will know who I'm talking about, but it was quite a long time ago, the late Bud Kelly used to say that he'd always be talking about Medford pride, and he'd say, he'd pull up a shirt and he had drawn blue and white on his arm and said that Medford pride runs in his veins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8520.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to you, superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8522.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford pride runs in your veins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8525.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we are very thankful for the time that you have been with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8530.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are so thankful for the role model you were to so many of our students for your, again, I come back to the word joy, but just, I think about the opening of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8543.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: outside when you had all the teachers, all of us sort of lined up and the teachers came in and there was so much excitement and your commitment to learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8553.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You took us through a very difficult and dark time with COVID when everybody was scared and anxious<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8565.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you were our leader, and that was just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8569.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we are here tonight to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8574.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems like it went so fast, but we so appreciate your dedication, the gifts you have brought to Medford, the gifts that you are leaving with us, and that we are better for you having been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8588.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so very much, Marice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=5903.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Come on, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=5904.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Come on, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7998.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7998.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7999.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8001.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good to see you, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8001.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8002.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to look around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8004.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm here today representing the Medford Educational Foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8009.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8010.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is David Sayers, my grants manager who manages all the grants that come in and organizes them for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8020.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're also joined, I'm just going to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8023.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our treasurer, who wasn't able to be here, but Steve Hayes, Gail Arslanian member, Chris DeVita, also Diane Caldwell, a name you'll all know, is part of our merry little group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8039.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8041.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did I get them all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8042.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8043.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, what we've been very quietly doing for the last eight, maybe nine years is giving away money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8051.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course it always amuses me that we have to come and ask you to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8055.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This amused me when I was sitting over there, because I would think you'd be so happy to take it you would just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8060.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: grab it from my hands and no need for formal approval but I'm here to give you $8,755 tonight to go towards the grants that teachers applied for so they we have a process where they write us their good ideas and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8077.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We weigh and deliberate over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8080.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very often, we can't fund all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8083.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received more than $26,000 in requests, just to give you some idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8087.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So roughly, right now, we're funding about a third of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8092.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But last year, all together, we gave you over $16,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8093.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're about on track for that this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8099.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the type of grants that we love to fund is, for your like example, the middle school librarians joined forces and asked us to fund a community read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8109.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we think that's a wonderful project to bring the middle school students together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8115.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Mississippi has asked us to fund, which we're partially funding, an author's visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8120.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They haven't had one for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8122.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the vocational school, they asked us for a brand new upgraded 3D printer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8128.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and a much more expensive one than they've had, and we funded that at your last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8135.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You okayed a field trip experience for the United Nations Club, and we're giving them $1,000 towards that trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8145.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an after-school cooking club at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8149.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8151.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: working on international food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8153.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we're funding some of their expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8157.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the thing we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8158.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're not earth shattering, but they sure are fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8161.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we think that they add to a student's enjoyment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8165.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we know from the feedback that we get that the teachers really present, appreciate having another funding source that they can ask to for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8175.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the funds we just gave out was for 50 bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8179.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a teacher said, boy, really appreciate that very small amount of money, but that's something we can do and something which, frankly, I know that doesn't always happen on your end because it's a different thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8191.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, we are very, very grateful to the people who support us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8196.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Needham Bank has been a great supporter of us, giving us over $5,000 for the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8201.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Fund has also contributed to us for several years running after we've written for grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8208.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're really an intermediary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8210.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We collect money and we give it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8212.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As soon as we get money, we give it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8214.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for that purpose, I'm going to let you know that the Kiwanis of Medford generously just let us know that we'll be receiving a check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8223.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and at your next meeting in two weeks time I won't come again but I will ask you there will be an additional there were a couple grants we couldn't fund that we really wanted to so you'll see us come up again just for your approval and we thank the Kiwanis and Needham Bank and Mr. Gene Kalaw from Needham Bank for their incredible support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8245.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8247.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that about covers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8251.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8252.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to always note that two of you used to be my students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8257.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John and Aaron both volunteered at Winchester Hospital when I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8262.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it does amuse me that you both ended up on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8267.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, who's gonna take the check and make sure it gets to the right place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8273.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8277.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'd really like to thank the very dedicated crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8279.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're small, but we've been absolutely consistent for years working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8285.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And David's done a phenomenal job, and Steve Hayes, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8289.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=140.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=177.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our first item is approval not required for review, seven grant F. I'm going to invite the proponent to present their plans for the log division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=190.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But first, if the city can actually set us up with this, and then the proponent can go ahead and continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=274.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So approval not required as reviewed by the board, we are to make sure that it meets certain criteria in which one of the criteria it does not meet as of yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=284.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that my current correct understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=518.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=519.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's Heidi Cabral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=577.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=578.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any questions from the board at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=589.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, based on the presentation by Attorney Cabral and Planner Evans has stated that it meets minimum percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=599.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is adequacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=603.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the right of way, and as of right now, there's vital access to the lots provided by Parkin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=610.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it meets all of the board's criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=613.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will put forth a motion to approve 7-Grant-F for approval not required, or to recommend, is it adopt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=623.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Endorse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=624.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you'll endorse the plan as approval not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=629.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Endorse the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=631.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Approval is not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=640.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A second motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=641.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=668.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have a quorum, so in this case, Ben Lovalli would not be voting, is that correct Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=674.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, he can vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=712.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item is approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=718.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess we can just ask for approval of all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=720.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyone has any objections or any corrections to any of the minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=728.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did have one, it was minor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=730.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe it was the very first one and it has like typos or something like, it was an approval not required, it was an original approval not required and it was supposed to be, it says nor, nor required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=742.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tiny little typos, if the city can actually look over those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=746.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would give a motion with those typos being corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=758.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yep, I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=760.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=761.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was the only thing that I caught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=775.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I will go through and ask for a motion for May 5th and May 25th because at that point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=788.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe only myself, Vice Chair Hedeman, Peter Kaus, and Ari Fishman are eligible to vote on those two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=800.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would need a motion from either Vice Chair Emily Hedeman, Peter Kaus, Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=807.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1049.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we be working with a consultant or is that something done internally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1054.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I know we started this process a couple of years back when we did the zoning recodification and we didn't pick up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1132.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if there's nothing else, if there's no support, has no questions, new members, anyone you want, this is your open time before we actually ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1146.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1206.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would love to pitch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1207.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't drink beer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1208.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's not a reason just to go and see, you know, hang out and have a great time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1211.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1211.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So patronize my foot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1478.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to note that board member Adam Barons have joined us and thank you so much for joining us, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1485.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Adam, I want to let you know that we have another new board member that joined us this evening, Ben Lavallee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1500.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And with that actually, oh and one other thing Adam, there was a note that Alicia and Danielle had suggested that we all send our cell phones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1512.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to them so that they can compile it in case we're running late or anything, and they'll know that we, they'll reach out and see if we're coming to the meeting or whatever, so that they actually have that and we're not waiting, going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1527.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's not so much just because, not because of your tonight, it's just to have it overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1532.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because sometimes we don't even know who's waiting in the waiting room if it's a phone number, so we try to match it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1540.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1542.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but it's really short meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1544.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1552.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OP_xaE-KQQM&t=1562.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome, then I'm going to do a roll call since my document of names opens back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=188.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=358.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=782.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I actually I don't have any questions at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=789.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to open it up to the board before it is a public hearing and I do have to open it up for public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=795.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to ask the board if there's any questions from anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=801.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This would be your chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=827.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I was pretty going to say, pretty much going to say that towards the end, there's so many more beneficial aspects with having established site control, such as the adequate space to remove the parallel parking with the circulation and safer access regress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=841.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then you have, not only do you have the required parking spaces for their residents, but you have given additional 27 for MHA employees and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=853.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that it's just way more beneficial and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=856.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm glad that you were able to establish site control and I'm going forward just just reminds the board that we definitely need to start to do a condition for modifications for these sorts of things so that the proponents do not have to come back going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=872.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what's saying that and seeing no other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=874.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=969.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=970.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=978.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to open up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=982.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=995.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1003.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1010.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1044.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1051.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the questions that I originally had was just how the city stood on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1057.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because it's reverting back to the original site plan, there were no concerns from the city or the transportation engineer at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1064.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that, if the board, if there's no other questions from the board, I will wait a second and then we can move to a motion to approve if there's no other questions from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1080.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1080.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seeing none, I will ask for a motion to approve the site plan modification for 121 Riverside Avenue, Myford Housing Authority, Salt and Stall Building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1090.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1774.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to clarify that it's Emily Keatons, the land use consultant and not our fabulous Vice Chair Emily Hederman that the city's working with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1989.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And without having to watch the entire meeting previously, Annie, or for anyone, the decision, I just approved and signed a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=1998.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it should be filed with the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2000.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle did that prior to her leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2002.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you want to see what came along with the decision, like the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2102.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm glad to hear that we weren't the ones that completely wrecked that schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2135.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some of the things they had to get done, like MassDOT by itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2523.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was about to go for your favorite item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2525.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think all of us at this point, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2691.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And with that, I am going to ask so that we're not adding other things to the agenda that have not been advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf7XgUqJFIM&t=2697.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=105.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, well, the first item on agenda for this evening is 1416 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=110.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a special permit for a detached ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=114.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a new public hearing, and I'll read the public hearing notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=117.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on August 7, 2024, after 6.30 p.m., remotely via Zoom, relative to an application submitted by Nancy Russa, for a special permit for a detached, essentially dwelling unit, ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=131.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is seeking to legalize and renovate an existing ADU and an existing detached garage structure on the same lot at Lot J-01-9, 1416 Mystic Valley Parkway, Mayford Mass 02155, which requires a special permit for Chapter 94, Section 8.2.2, City of Mayford Zoning Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=155.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please provide any introductory comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=517.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=520.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=523.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will open it up to the board for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=525.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things for clarity that I want, Danielle, can you please just quickly go back to the, I didn't hear the second ingress as part of the requirements that have been met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=535.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were the things that were in compliance already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=654.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many parking spaces are included as of right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=751.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Based on topography, it's not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=753.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It'd be more of a hardship than anything at this point for adding the unnecessary parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=776.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I definitely agree and with that, I'm going to open it up if if the board has any questions for the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=793.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=794.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's the only thing that we were really weighing on if it meets all other building codes, I'm actually going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=802.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: ask for a motion to approve the special permit for 1416 Mystic Valley Parkways ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=827.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I have to back up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=830.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I jumped the gun, and this is a public hearing, so I am going to open it up in case there's any public comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=837.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although we voted ahead, I do have to give the public a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=846.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to go back and open up the public comment period, and those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=870.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself or staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=878.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters that you may have received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=911.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seeing no public comment and hearing that there has not been anything received, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting, and I'm going to revert back to the original vote with Peter Kalbs making the first motion and Sally Akiki seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=929.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will do the roll call to make it complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=958.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our second agenda item is approval not required for 98 to 100 Magoon Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=969.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have, I'm sorry, I do not have the applicant's name readily available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=992.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Angel, Angel is your last, your surname?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1007.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to have the city lead us and give us a brief discussion, a brief overview, and then we'll have you introduce yourself and the project, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1142.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are the dimensions on this, Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1266.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it fronts on the right of way, has vital access, and it exceeds the minimum frontage requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1272.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are the three requirements to remind the board that an A&R needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1277.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So without further ado, if the board has no questions, I am going to ask for a motion to approve the A&R, although it doesn't need an approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1287.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so the motion is to endorse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1290.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To endorse the A&R.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1334.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a great evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1335.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for being with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1336.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1361.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1362.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1363.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the third item on our agenda is approval of minutes, but they don't appear to be ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1399.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so number four is zoning overhaul updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1402.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, do you have anything for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1535.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1537.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just quickly to touch base, speaking on updates to zoning and so forth, Daniel, you were mentioning earlier about the housing bond bill that passed the new ADU law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1549.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure if you'll need the board to sort of help with that or if it starts in the planning office and what you'll be overruling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1557.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know that KP Law, this attorney from KP Law, is actually going to do like a lunch and learn to try to figure out what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1565.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the law, the new law says, does, what's effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1568.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to try to kind of put it in layman's terms for us planners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1622.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Chris Clutchman, um, actually, uh, who's already doing the MTA laws has mentioned something about, uh, something coming down the pipeline, but I have not heard anything official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1633.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now that we're two separate secretariats, I, I don't have that information real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1639.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1640.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm in a separate secretariat now, but I'm assuming that that's being worked on now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1645.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can get you all, I mean, you'll probably get the information as fast as I get the information, or maybe even sooner, because it's going out to municipalities as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1660.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I have not again, I have not digested even the bridge version of what was sent out by one of our not not all heroes wear capes and there is a planner out there who actually digested this information and put it into like a little compact document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1678.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't even had a chance to read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1680.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1682.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, I didn't want to drag on on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1683.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to know if there was anything that the board was going to have to do differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1686.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if that was, I know it's going to come down the pipeline because we just approved an ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1693.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I didn't know how that was going to look going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1715.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then just are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1717.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The 2nd item is how do we get these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1722.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to an administrative process with your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1724.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1725.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1728.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know about the rest of the board, but... That's just gonna be a waste of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1733.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it's just, it's one of those things where it's like, we rely on you, you guys, to give us the information for those three requirements that we hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1741.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you know that they hit them all at that point, it's a waste of the, it's not the best use of the client's time, your time or the board's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1751.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's more of, again, not trying to put more on your plate, but how do we get those quick things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1806.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, rubber stamps, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1811.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and with that, there's no other items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1818.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If no one wants to share anything, then I will ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1826.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, your turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1832.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NWLvvQCjaf4&t=1833.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=115.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=117.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So our first agenda item is 400 Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=122.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a special permit and a site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=125.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's an application from Herb Chambers at 400 Mystic, and it's 400 Mystic LLC for the site plan review to permit the construction of a new three-story structure to replace the existing three-story structure, renovation of the existing five-story structure, along with modifications to the existing parking, vehicular circulation, landscape, and utilities associated with the proposed Herb Chambers-Toyota Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=149.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition, the proposal requires special permits for the following motor vehicle-related uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=154.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's H3, motor vehicle sales or rental of new vehicles only, accessory storage entirely with an enclosed structure, H4, outdoor motor vehicle sales and storage accessory to H3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=166.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Commercial two, zoning district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=171.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This meeting is a, this is an actual continued public hearing from June 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=176.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to ask the Medford City staff to do introductory comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=182.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before inviting the client to present a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=232.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who will be presenting for the applicant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=235.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can introduce yourselves and you can begin your proposal or your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=250.111s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And who's actually presenting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1097.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1099.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a clarifying question on your plan B, if there was any feedback from Todd, the actual traffic engineer from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1110.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Daniel, do you have that information, if there was feedback on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1159.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, the language can just cover that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1161.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would have to be in coordination with director Blake and MassDOT to make sure that it was at the city and MassDOT's standards or something to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1199.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make it as simple as possible, but at the same time, clarify it so that it can actually move forward easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1205.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1211.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any clarifying questions from the board before I open it up to the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1229.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter Kelce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1263.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1268.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record and remind all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1278.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1286.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1293.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't look like we have any members on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we can officially close the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1315.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that brings us back to the draft recommendation and conditions so better understand what we are moving forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1326.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, if there's any questions or comments from the board at this time, before I move to motion or approve, are you understanding what we are working with now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1345.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Danielle, for clarifications on the conditions in the offsite, I am not sure what offsite conditions, Director Blake, that have not been addressed to include with the draft conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1467.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so for the draft recommendations from previously, these have been rectified for the most part as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1475.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had eight drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1477.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to make sure that we're on the same page with the proponent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1480.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are the drafts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1482.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the remaining conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1597.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So beginning from condition one, that was highlighted with control plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1602.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Plan modifications have been resubmitted but have control plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1730.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I'm just going to go through just to, so we're not, and then we came to number three on your end, requotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1738.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the builder permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1825.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kirk house, are you taking down the new conditions or you, um, as we go along, I'm just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1849.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1850.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1854.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have we wordsmithed for that scenario?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1860.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to decide on language regarding the MassDOT access permit for scenario two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1996.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so going over the conditions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2000.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: want to take a shot at the conditions before right before I recommend the motion for special event and the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=123.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=125.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for our first item, let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=136.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe our first item this evening is approval not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=141.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's an ANR, which I plan for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=144.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's seven and nine Jeremiah circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=147.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, I'm going to provide the proponents of the plans, the 79 Jeremiah Circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=153.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you give access to screen share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=180.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's okay to keep that what I can do is we'll see if we'll just move it to another portion of the meeting later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=192.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this time, I'll see if 400 mystic adversary for special permit site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=199.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe because we don't have a full voting body this evening, we will be listening to a presentation by the proponent because there will be a site plan review revision that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=210.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will at this time, read the public hearing notice before the proponent can make, before the city makes introductory comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=221.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 5th, 2024 at 630.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=1091.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have something else that's to scale just for the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=1094.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can follow along, but I'm not sure that everyone's going to have an easy enough time following along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2683.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so there are EV chargers, but I just wanted to, I didn't know if you wanted more in addition because they, they're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2690.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Blake has also mentioned that he would like to see more as the need arises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2706.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2707.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that, so speaking of that, I wanted to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2710.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had not, thank you, Vice Chair Edelman, for bringing up the also location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2715.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that brings more traffic here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2717.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Attorney Marinelli had originally said that the traffic report said there was going to be 656 fewer uses than the former bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2727.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I'm just trying to figure out how that ties into the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2734.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess this is when we need our board member, Peter Cowles, and understanding the impact in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2741.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to trust that you did your traffic report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2746.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't get into that, but I just, I want to have a little bit more confidence that it will not trigger any kind of more traffic congestion there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2823.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2825.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there are sort of generic codes and it's kind of hard with the actual versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2833.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: versus existing conditions and trying to forecast for that traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2836.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So me being a planner myself, I don't usually, traffic studies, they're very helpful, but just knowing the area itself, I usually look for other indicators of confidence, but I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2849.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to go with board member, Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2980.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2983.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, Director Blake has captured that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2985.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was one of my concerns, but it was something that was captured within.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=2989.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I guess at this point, I'm going to ask the city for clarification if there's anything that you wanted to add before I open it up to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3001.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3250.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there's a plan B, it would help with the process going forward because the board can vote on an administrative process for the city to actually, for planning staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3260.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to approve as opposed to you coming back before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3263.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something to keep in mind if you do have a plan B. We've learned our lessons previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3277.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3894.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3895.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=3897.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to open it up for public comments since the public hearing this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4300.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I didn't want to cut you off at the two minute mark because we don't have any other comments coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4308.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to allow the proponent to decide if they want to respond now or just keep in mind what Mr. Cross has mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4388.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's definitely something for you to take with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4390.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, don't um at this point, it's it's it's you're not um If you can just take uh, mr. Cross's comments into consideration and and just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4401.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: respond accordingly going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4449.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4454.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm going to ask for clarification if the board has any clarifying comments or questions going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4463.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to remind the board that we will not be voting this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4466.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The proponent will be coming back before us with revised site plans as per recommendations of Todd Blake and other department heads, including the PDS staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4477.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if there's any last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4478.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: other additional recommendations you want to give before we continue their hearing to a date certain which would be June 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4504.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: hearing none, and actually before I ask for a motion, I just wanted to just circle back really quick to Mr. Cross and let you know that I definitely, I didn't want to put the performant on the spot right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4517.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted him to take your recommendations into full consideration to be able to offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4525.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: an appropriate response for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4526.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4529.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to move it for them to think about it going forward with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4533.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So coming back to June 26, if I can have a motion to continue the hearing for 400 Mystic Avenue to June 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4545.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4572.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Attorney Ron Valley, Mr. Walsh, and all that have presented this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4588.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4598.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle has our I just want to make sure before I know we're going to do the next item, but just for the A&R is has the performance showed up for 79 Jeremiah circle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4612.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I am going to invite the board to present for 79 Jeremiah, just to remind the board that this is an approval not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4621.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are specifically looking to make sure that it meets the frontage right requirements and adequate access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4629.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at that point, if I can, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4632.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ibrahim, if you can go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4638.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're on mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4640.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4801.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Ibrahim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4810.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to make sure that so this doesn't change the frontage at all does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4869.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The real lot line, so that does not affect access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4874.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can the city help me with this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4876.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It does not sound like it's affecting access at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4881.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4910.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4911.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4917.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To clarify for the board, basically, again, we're looking at the front on the right-of-way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4924.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it satisfy the minimum frontage requirements, which is 35 feet at least?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4929.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is there vital access to the lights provided?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4932.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And based on Mr. Ibrahim's presentation, I would ask for a motion to endorse the plan as an A&R.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4940.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see any other reason not to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4952.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't need approval, but it needs an endorsement for not needing approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=4960.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Vice Chair Herman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5218.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, this is what I'm looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5229.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want, that's what I'm trying to double check as Lily was asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5277.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One second, Mr. Abraham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5278.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Abraham, before you leave, we just wanted to make sure we got Vice Chair Hederman's, we still haven't voted as a board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5285.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5286.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5287.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5288.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's totally okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5289.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She had a great, Vice Chair Hederman brought up a great question, and I knew that I had seen something on the site plan, but it's, I think it was just the way that the information was presented, and so now we're all back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5301.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can ask for a motion to endorse the ANR 47 and 9 Jeremiah circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5310.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And can I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5314.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, Sally can have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5317.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so roll call vice chair Hederman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5320.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5377.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so the next item on our agenda for this evening is zoning amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5381.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe there was a city council paper number 24-033 where they refer it to us for this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5389.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will read the public hearing notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5427.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to the zoning of any parcels within the city, but is intended to confirm the best information available to the city regarding the existing zoning destination for all properties in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5443.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Number four, amending sections 94.1-4, 94.6.3-3,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5481.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to introduce the consultant and to give us a brief update or introductory comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=5571.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6194.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6199.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this point, it's preferable if you just go through everything, and I guess we can ask questions at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6640.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyone unmute me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6641.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6643.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We appreciate your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6645.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, I'm going to defer to the city and see if you want to add anything before I open it up to the board for clarifying the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6824.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have, I just wanted to know in the definitions, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6828.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Stenz, you had said that the factory built versus manufactured, the only difference was that one was built in a factory and put on site, and then one was actually built on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6841.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I could have that backwards, or did I get that wrong?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6918.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6919.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the manufactured homes, as far as like utilities and things like that, that usually doesn't have a basement because it's manufactured offsite, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6927.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Utilities go replaced with a basement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6929.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to follow with the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6931.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6948.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the board have any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6970.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for myself, too, having followed this with Danielle and Director Hunt, I just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6977.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to appreciate all the work that's gone into it and I wanted to encourage the board to take Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6982.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Enns up on the recommendations as Director Hunt has been asking us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6987.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that I wanted to dive into the site plan changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6992.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: try to get some feedback on things where, why do we do things a certain way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=6997.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can some things be done administratively through the PDS and so forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7001.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have not found enough time in a day to get that, but I encourage us all to sort of think about how we can be more helpful in that process going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7013.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And with that, I don't have any other questions myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7015.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know that I have to open this up to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7018.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And before I do that, I wanted to see if the city has any other questions or comments at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7035.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, I am going to open up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7038.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature and message Danielle with a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7091.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this point, if the board has no final comments, I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend to the city council, recommend approval of proposed amendments to the city council as presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7107.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, if the city can help with this, we would recommend also to add the footnotes as brought up by Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XKbpn7WuHTw&t=7115.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Hunt, if you could actually help us to wordsmith that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=577.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The differences between the first plans and these plans are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=582.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It may not be 100%, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=585.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's also at the point where we can see how much you've worked with the city to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=591.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, for one, can appreciate that, especially with that curtain wall corner that we were concerned with the privacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=599.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the whole idea of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=603.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: how an actual passerby will see the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=607.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I can appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=608.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will open it up to the board for any other questions or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=619.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No questions or concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=623.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No follow-up questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=628.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the plan address overall concerns for the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=685.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the city have any advice on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=740.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as for the special permit, are we still concerned with the parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=744.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's one of the questions that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=747.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there was maybe condition tenants<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=753.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: only of that particular address could use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=756.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that something that we're still working with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=895.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hearing no further, seeing no further questions or hands raised from the board, because it is a public hearing, I will open it up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=906.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=910.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at MedfordMA.org.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=924.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=932.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=988.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will close the public comment period for this meeting and open it back up for deliberation between the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=995.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things I wanted to leave with is I remember hearing this previously, and it was conditioned to the point where it was almost a different project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1005.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the fact that the applicant has addressed all of those issues and the concerns regarding the staff who has worked with the city, as well as addressed all of the additional input from the board, I have nothing further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1022.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, if the board has anything further to say, other than that, I would look for a motion for the first part to approve the site plan for 290 Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1102.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because the special permit is for retail uses until the city updates are allowed for that corridor, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1110.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that what we're doing a special permit for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1112.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, the special permit is for the, so it'll be retail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1117.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're asking for us to condition a space, a parking space we save for that commercial use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1146.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1146.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I was just waiting for you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1152.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter Calves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1167.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, can you actually read what you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1170.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1230.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so for the board to discuss the condition as recommended by director Blake, that would not be captured in recommendations that would have to be fleshed out for the parking space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1256.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1256.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1257.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so how does the board overall feel about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1262.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director blake's Recommendation to condition a parking space for commercial use only Director blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1280.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if you want uh, uh, pardon me, uh vice chair heteman<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1322.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have no opinion either way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1326.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Either way, I was going to offer if Director Blake could better explain that condition and reasons for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1393.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1396.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1452.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Heidemann?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1544.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hanneman, did you want to speak again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1580.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1644.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it sounds like overall for the board, for this item, we're gonna defer to the applicant, the property owner to handle the parking in this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1665.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for the criteria to approve the site plan, if I can, Peter, not to put this back on you, but as the clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1672.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can ask for a motion with the conditions that you have collected, it seems as though the city is okay with those conditions as stated previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1729.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a... So that's PETA's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1734.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion to accept, a second motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1741.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So going back, Vice Chair Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1746.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, we're going to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1748.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1749.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: PETA cows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1750.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1752.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maryasky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1753.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1755.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1756.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1757.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I was absent during the last meeting, but I have, I am attestant to the fact that I have watched the meeting in full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1765.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am, I am also now eligible to vote and I'm an aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1773.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now to discuss, this is also a special permit to make sure that there are no adverse effects that will outweigh the beneficial impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1783.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's looking at the social economic community needs, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities and public services, compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood, impacts on the natural environment, and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1803.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I can say is that it's way better than what's there now, and it will definitely transform the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1809.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would look for a motion to approve the special permit to allow for the retail use at 290 Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1825.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A second motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1830.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I ask for the motion, then a board member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1833.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't give the motion myself, so Peter has given the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1836.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1839.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1842.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=1881.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a public hearing, so I will read the notice again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2329.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although we saw this a while, I will tell you that this came in so late that I have not wrapped my head around the differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2337.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would help for me anyways, just to help to speed this a little, to provide more time, not without just in haste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2347.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't wanna do anything in haste, but at the same time, I need to be able to wrap this around my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2353.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you please compare the changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2354.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to better understand what these changes are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2626.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to figure out egress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2628.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's kind of hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2631.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2633.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what's the egress situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2704.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And not because it's in the same family, but Danielle, if I'm not mistaken, Atlas is built the same, right turn only, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2711.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you come out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2727.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can turn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2815.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I got held up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2817.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was looking at the transportation so you can however you want to proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=2821.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to there was some clarifying questions to wrap my head around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3141.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Speaking with Danielle earlier, one of the concerns that I had with that actual option would be that the back of Mystic Valley Parkway or Route 16, the way it merges with that exit on I-93, that would be putting a lot of traffic, spilling a lot of traffic out at that traffic light coming on to Mystic, before you get to Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3163.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just the way Mystic Valley Parkway is set up, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3276.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3277.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3279.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3359.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3363.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't wanna speak against the state because they're there for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3366.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Me working for a state, a fellow state agency myself, I definitely understand, but I will tell you that economically, it could kill a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3375.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And unless the city is looking at a feasibility of a traffic study for the entire strip where others can actually come in and pay for the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3385.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just, I can't even imagine what an access permit, not adding costs, but at the same time, adding time to this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3393.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've just taken that into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3396.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It could, in the future, be like a, I'm not sure how the proponent feels about that anyways, but just in my experience, I know that it could be cumbersome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3413.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3659.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I missed his author.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3661.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, I, myself as just one board member, I wouldn't be comfortable conditioning that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3671.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any comments or concerns from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3673.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=3939.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4000.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do see that we just had a couple of people, I'm not sure if there's public, so I'm going to open it up at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4073.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for this meeting or the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4078.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll go back to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4080.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For the city, can you actually provide us with the original?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4083.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there's some conditions that are no longer relevant with these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4088.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you remind us of what still stands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4410.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, did you provide us with these conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4414.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I'm looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4859.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and before Ari goes, one of the things I wanted to note, Director Hunt, is that I haven't been properly prepped on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4867.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure about the rest of the board to know even how to discuss conditions going forward, is what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4873.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know what the department heads, I don't remember, recall what the department heads' suggestions are going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4879.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the problem I'm having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4880.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what I was trying to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4934.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The beauty of what you have just said would have been relevant in a PDS memo prior to this meeting, and we could have been prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4947.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, and I definitely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=4949.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But when you said fair, it would have helped to be more fair of everyone's time across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5303.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5304.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5305.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And trust me, I definitely, I sympathize and I empathize with the lack of capacity on your end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5312.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not placing fault at this point at all, but at the same time, the owner should not be on the board to try to speed through something that we're not able to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5321.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we understand that it's also not the applicant's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5323.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's no fault being placed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5325.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not even gonna blame MASCA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5327.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're doing their due diligence, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5328.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's one of those things where I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5330.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's so complex, there's layers to this, and I'm just trying to better understand so that I can lead the board in making a decision forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5339.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand it's not fair to anyone across the board, whether it's the city, the applicant, or the board, in trying to rush this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5347.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just need to know the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5482.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5548.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5712.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Director Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5714.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter Cowles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5740.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it's a very difficult situation, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the board, again, the onus is neither on the board to make a decision without having the proper information going forward, because it wasn't our fault either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5753.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's unfortunate, but the onus is not on the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5763.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, in saying that, I will ask if the board wants to discuss these additional conditions, if there's something that we can come up with that is agreeable with both the board and the city that can make sense that we can capture to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5786.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5935.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can condition it to make sure that the applicant is working with the city staff or department heads to move that forward, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5945.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To flush that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5991.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=5994.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter cows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6119.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6120.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you mention the actual signage, the wayfinding as recommended?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6140.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6145.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6146.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6192.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ari.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6193.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's what I meant by going back to the city staff and make sure that there was a minimal agreement on what was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6201.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe I left that too broad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6225.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6226.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pena Cowles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6277.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Zartha, before we ask for a motion on those additional conditions to approve your amendment, are you okay with those conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6305.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6305.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, it's just to explore that the fact that you're even going to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6310.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6311.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6318.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6348.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The board in our position, you would use it as a condition, but would that be PDS staff that would make the recommendation for why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6443.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I can only imagine that the board's recommendation to explore that would back that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6449.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6453.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I am going to ask the clerk for a motion to approve the amendment to the site plan as he has already recited conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6514.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, can I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=6520.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so Peter Kelce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7307.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out the tasks that are coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7679.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I just want to say that I obviously, I am very appreciative of all of you, but I have to give a special shout out to Peter for the way you captured those conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7688.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I stare and it's like I fumble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5GOoqKbpo08&t=7690.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm trying to capture them myself on this end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=173.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=176.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the next item, we're going to go to 294 Harvard Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=184.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a special permit to establish a motor vehicle repair establishment, which is auto glass within an existing building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=197.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that the date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=200.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I can have the Method staff introduce the proponent again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=281.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that said, I will open the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=284.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=303.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=312.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=337.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so in that case, I will close the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=342.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to remind the board, I remember we were mostly in agreement, but due to the technical error, we were not able to vote at the last meeting, but we said that if the proponent came back, we would be willing to approve with a couple of conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=359.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Condition one being to remove the barbed wire on the fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=362.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: maintain screening on the fence to ensure parking is not visible from the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=367.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The proponent was actually amenable to that condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=370.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Condition two, prior to applying for a sign permit, the applicant must submit plans to planning staff for review approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=377.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Preferred signage type would be downcast lighting, such as gooseneck, or halo-lit channel letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=383.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe the proponent was amenable to that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=388.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Condition number three, strike parking, the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=393.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe, I'm not sure that we have to go over the benefits of this, making sure that the benefits outweigh any adverse effects as we've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=403.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I'm not sure if the board has any further questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hUaFTg-SXts&t=408.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you want to move forward with, if I can have an actual motion to approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=119.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to go right into the first item on our agenda, which is 290 Salem Street, which is continued from 4<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=126.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, I believe this was continued from two 1324.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=129.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=132.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=133.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a site plan review plus special permit to allow the construction of a three-story mixed use building to, to contain seven residential units above ground for commercial space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=143.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can please have the city staff make any introductory comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=172.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I can please have the applicant introduce yourselves and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=177.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, if you can please provide them sharing abilities, whoever is speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=962.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, for one, I want to thank you for seriously taking into consideration the board's comments previously, because I know that you needed to get to a certain plan design before going to the ZBA, but this has been hugely significant, especially explaining how the context of the lot and how it plays into the buildings across from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=983.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=985.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing I want to clarify is the dumpster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=988.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was a little confused on the dumpster last time, and I'm still trying to figure out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=992.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um understanding the the dumpster so if you can go back to that and then i'll i'll pass it off to the rest of the board Just how that dumpster will um So I I get I I can answer this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1066.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1066.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only other two comments I would have is just to make sure at this point to adhere to the department has comments going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1075.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's not much more I can speak on outside of final plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1080.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then if the city had any questions on the architectural design of the balconies, I'm a little curious as to what the city would say before sending this to the ZBA, because as we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1095.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if this is the chance to actually pretty much weigh in on those balconies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1100.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see an issue with them at this point, but I'm not sure what the city thinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1105.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I'll open it up to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1117.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: specifically the architectural features of the balconies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1122.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How does that play into the city's plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1129.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The corner, I am a little concerned about too, but it's a lot better than what we've seen previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1427.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1428.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to go to the board and I see Emily and then Pam after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1593.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1595.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And next is Pam Marianski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1671.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Pam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1675.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is information to take in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1678.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's given the applicant a little bit of idea of how the board will move to vote in a future meeting, because we know that you still need variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1692.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you're not prepared to answer board member Marianski's question now, just keep it in the back of your head that that is a concern that one of the board members has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1702.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then, okay, so we'll go to board member Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1708.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1898.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have Vice Chair Hedeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1900.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1958.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1959.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I am going to open up the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1964.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1985.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=1997.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2006.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a comment in the chat that I'm not sure if that participant is still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2014.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we can stop that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2017.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cheryl R., did you want to read out your question before we begin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2030.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Danielle, I can't see anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2201.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2316.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2320.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you don't have any other comments to read, to share, and there was no hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2330.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2336.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to bring it back to the board, and so we're not voting on 290 Salem Street this evening, because as I mentioned earlier, they still need variances, but we want to give them an idea of what's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2352.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and to give them some feedback if there's gonna be additional changes before they go off to the ZBA for me and before they wind up coming back before us if those variances are approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2366.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have no further comments other than just making sure that you're being in tune with the department head comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2376.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have no comments until that's handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2378.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if the board has any other comments that they wanna share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2383.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for this evening for 290 Salem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2391.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hearing none, I am going to ask for a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2395.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Chair, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2397.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2415.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that would be, do we know that should the applicant come back before us for once we can vote, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2424.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But because we're not voting this evening, I didn't reiterate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2431.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that, we will vote to continue the meeting to a date certain after their ZBA meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2551.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It makes a lot of sense and I appreciate you asking for clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2556.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So basically where I was going with it is based on the comments that the board has made tonight, I would have the applicant make definitely make sure that they're keeping the design wall in mind and then knowing that there's going to be a condition for parking coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2570.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if this board was to move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2572.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But other than outside of that, I think the actual stance right now is that this is an acceptable plan going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2580.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I can't vote by myself and I can't vote without ZBA's approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2586.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I think we pretty much gave you the idea of how we would vote going forward, just with the feedback that we gave tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2693.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I can tell you, and I'm not sure if this is even legal or permissible, but at this time, I would ask for a motion of approval with a couple of conditions that doesn't necessarily significantly change the architectural structure at all, and definitely not the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2715.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm trying to give as much headway as possible without voting and without speaking for the entire board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2726.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we're allowed to, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2857.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I definitely understand because they're not able to grant a variance that would be detrimental to anything that we've actually changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2864.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2867.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, at this point, Director Hunt, my hands are tied as far as how we can help the client going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=2875.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Legally, I don't know what can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3108.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, those are the only two conditions that I have from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3111.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then anything that needs to be addressed from the department heads, which at this point, I'm not able to decipher myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3193.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh yeah, and I was very much aware of that, but I'm not sure that we're asking to change setbacks on that corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3202.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think any board member had an issue with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3203.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this at this point, especially with their being limited open space, and then there's retail on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3208.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think any board member had an issue with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3293.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, and again, just to echo that and to re-clarify again that if another board was to grant the variances with the architectural features that we've seen before us, we understand that it would be detrimental if we change anything later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3311.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see this board changing anything that would be detrimental to those variances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3341.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just to be safe, I'm going to ask for a motion to send a memo to the ZBA through the PDF staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3350.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on behalf of 290 Salem Street, letting them know what conditions we would approve the site plan and special permit with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3363.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I so move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3365.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3369.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3380.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. And now I believe we need a motion to continue 290 Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3388.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it have to be a date certain, Danielle, or just to the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3407.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, a motion to move 290 Salem Street to the next meeting on April 3rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3414.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3434.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure if I said the language properly, it's to continue, not move, but it's the same, I hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3497.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is seeking to demolish the existing structures, a construction staging yard, 48 Commercial Street, and a vacant industrial building, 64 Commercial Street, and construct a two-story, 97,857-square-foot research and testing laboratory, which is in allowed use in an industrial zoning district at 48 to 64 Commercial Street, Medford Mass 02155.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3523.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our board is the site plan review authority per section 11-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3526.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: PDS staff, can you make any introductory comments, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3615.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to make sure here, the board would definitely need to see final plans to vote going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3622.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can open up the public hearing this evening to hear the applicant, but we would be voting on final plans since there's some back and forth with the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3657.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's what we need to be clear of, because when it's conditioned to the point of change, then that means we should have a final set that we're voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3671.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, we'll hear it going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3673.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe the tiny dash, you could go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3734.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And before you continue, Attorney Dash, I'm not sure about everyone else, but I'm having a hard time hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=3739.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought it was my audio, but then someone else just spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5592.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have some clarifying questions, but I'm just not sure where the conditions lie at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5601.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, do you want to give, I know that you haven't had a chance, but is there anything that's specific that's standing out from the city right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=5608.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I just want to make sure we get that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6130.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to echo Vice Chair Hederman's questioning on the pedestrian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6135.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did see the link with the trees there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6138.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was one of the questions that I actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6145.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to my delight, that has been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6147.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would have been my only other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6151.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seeing no more questions from the board, I am going to open it up for public comment at this time, since it is a public hearing, and I'll read the public notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=6790.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: actually a condition based on that, or did you want to have the applicant come back before us with a new set of plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7616.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you go back to the actual fence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7617.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that there's no cars left overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7625.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But how is the work shielded from the right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7628.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know it's an industrial area, but to kind of clean up the property, how to keep it neat in that area, how are the cars shielded from outside view?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7773.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7774.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My biggest concern was that it was a surface parking lot, but I didn't hear what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7780.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The surface parking lot was just overhead and I wasn't sure how the cars were going to be kept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7788.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you've already clarified that they were not kept overnight and that they would be inside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7793.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just trying to figure out exactly what that looked like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7800.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that I appreciate the follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=7801.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to actually open it up to the board for further questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8291.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was some feedback on, I know you were amenable to putting up some signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8296.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You spoke about signs and then the condition of the barbed wire that the city did not particularly care for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8306.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you amenable to that, Mrs. Nucci?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8313.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then when, of course the city has, if you, when you apply for the sign permit, you have to submit the plans to the planning staff for that going forward, but we'll spell that condition out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8324.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll have the city spell that condition out before the board makes a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8340.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to skip steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8346.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, that's why we're even, um, making sure that we're dotting our I's and crossing our T's for tonight's technicality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8510.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to give you an idea of where I sit myself, and then the board can actually all speak, is I actually wanted to make sure that there were no adverse effects, there was no benefits as opposed to adverse effects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8523.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will be absolutely transparent with you and let you know that I'm not entirely sure that it's the highest and best use, but there are definitely benefits to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8533.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the use at this point, especially with your property being vacant for over a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8543.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that there's no negative benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8546.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If anything, it'll be all positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8548.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And saying that, I will actually be more in favor of this project going forward at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8555.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will turn it over to see if the board has anything else to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8567.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hederman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8585.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8586.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8586.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which is based on a technicality, so pretty much we'll get our tentative approval this evening with conditions, and they will come back to have us vote officially on a date certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8602.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we got that, Average Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8637.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we do have a couple of conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8639.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, do you want to summarize those for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8715.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just Vice Chair Hedeman had mentioned striped parking for the commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8722.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hedeman, do you want to speak or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8800.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I would that would be very helpful, especially with the direction of the city's comprehensive plan for the use of the South that South method area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8809.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would it would give us a little more idea of what better fits there if.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8816.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That use is not compatible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8821.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8848.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because it's still a special permit, you're being, you're a least<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8854.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your use is considered a leased use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8857.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So before that lease can be renewed, you would have to come back before our board for another special permit before the landlord can actually just allow you another lease just to make sure that it's complying again with the city's use for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8878.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a comprehensive plan, a vision for that area and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8883.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As of right now, although it's industrial, it's not by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8889.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're giving you a special permit because it goes against the uses that the city has moved forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8894.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in order to continuously allow a use that's not compatible with the area, we need to make sure that there is more benefits than adverse effects, if that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=8912.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, did you want to add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9033.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just we're trying to provide the city with some safeguards on how, like if there were adverse effects that outweigh the benefits going forward, how do we revisit that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9043.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not, again, in lieu of having a city solicitor here, I'm not sure how to move forward with that condition either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9053.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not, I guess we wouldn't condition it this evening if the city's not comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9059.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can have these answers in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9063.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, yeah, so we'll take we'll table that for now, but keep it in if the city can actually report back on that that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9073.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice chair Edelman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9113.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: absolutely clear that it was given the city a safeguard, but at the same time, I'm more invested in the comprehensive plan for the use of that area, especially having been on the comprehensive board steering committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9128.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter Cowles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9148.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9153.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We definitely will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9155.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to just make sure that I got everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9157.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I have Mr. Bean, you have something to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9261.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to reiterate what Daniel has already said, as of right now, the reason why you need a special permit is an auto glass shop is not the highest and best use for that area as per our comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9278.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, because we found that there's more benefits than adverse effects as of today's date, the board has decided to allow it to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9288.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we are trying to figure out in five years, will that continue to be the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9294.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the best way to explain this is it's not the city's vision for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9300.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure that they would want to continuously allow that use in that area, especially after putting so much time and energy into zoning recodification and zoning amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9347.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, and so just to, I want to make sure because now you have the tenant that's, and I understand, I would be the same way that you would continue to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9362.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so if this is something that does not need to be on the table, we can take it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9367.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if it's not even something within our purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9429.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hetherman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9500.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm willing to take it, definitely, as we've already said, we've already talked about what the conditions were and how we felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9507.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we'll just leave it at a provisional approval pending the applicant coming back before us at 8th of April 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9517.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we'll, with those, the three conditions that we will maintain is to remove the barbed wire on the fence,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9525.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: prior to applying for a sign permit, the applicant must submit plans to the planning staff, and then the strike parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9530.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll leave it at those three conditions and not entertain anything else as far as changes of police use, that would be up to the landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9541.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will look for, in leaving it there, I will look for a motion to continue this to April 3rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9557.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds like you had a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9580.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Hederman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9585.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fischman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9586.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9587.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Mariansky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9589.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9589.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9592.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. DiNucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9594.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Hohner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9595.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry if I'm saying your name incorrectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9625.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9628.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9631.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the next item is approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9638.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Alicia, I'm going to ask for a motion to move the zoning overhaul updates until our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9651.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but we'll do the approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9657.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, or an ongoing conversation so that we can definitely, because what the city is doing is actually providing us an opportunity to have these conversations with them before they just come with us and say, Hey, this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9669.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What do you feel about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9670.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they're bringing us in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9671.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I truly appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9673.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in saying that, I want to make sure that I have the time that permits<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9677.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to give quality feedback and not just, you know, just get it like a checkbox and get it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9683.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9728.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can provide counsel and that's not like violate any kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9750.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9750.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause if we, if we all, if it's not a joint meet and then we all signed in and have comments, that's, that's definitely a quorum, but you are not the decision-making body at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9772.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9774.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when are the meetings if the committee on zoning and planning windows usually held?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9799.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9800.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a motion to approve the minutes from February 21st, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9802.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9811.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9812.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9829.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam, did I call your name on the last thing that we voted on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9833.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9834.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9839.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm inserting names here because you guys keep switching on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9843.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's like I wanted to make sure that I got you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9847.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9851.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unless, oh, before we adjourn, are there any other updates that the city may have or that the board may have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9858.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will say that, and we'll discuss this more, but I've been thinking about revisiting rules and regulations, especially for administrative procedures on site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9868.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that site plan review is part of zoning, so I want to make sure that I have substantial comments for the board to review as well as the PDS staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9877.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the only thing I've been thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9879.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know if any of you have been thinking about any of the rules and regulations going forward, but that's something to probably provide to the PS staff as soon as possible, especially if it includes anything that's part of zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9892.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but the administrative procedures, um, for site plan is what's been on my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9906.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9914.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I so move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rHW3832dHik&t=9916.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3730.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you all for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3732.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have some clarifying questions, but I think they'll probably be better fleshed out as we go through the department head comments, because there are plenty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3741.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was looking at the traffic and you had mentioned that there was a level of service F, which is the worst of the levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3752.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to wrap my head around the mitigation that you were trying to explain for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3759.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to see what the level of service F had to do in regards to the mitigation that was suggested by the traffic engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3976.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for clarifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3978.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to clarify my inquiry was that I understand that the no build scenario, but however, it's like, it's you create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3989.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: no matter how many new cars you add to that intersection, it's still creating, it's adding to the instability of that breakneck point, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=3999.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's like, just like if you were on, I don't know, intersection 495, whether you build something new, intersection 495 is going to always be unstable at a loss of F. And I just want to know what were the other scenarios that you would do to create mitigation for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4045.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4046.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4102.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4126.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4132.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do any other board members have clarifying questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4151.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I actually I'm not sure if there's so we this public comments and I just want to remind public or actually I haven't read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=4978.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, can you please unmute and for the commenter, can you please identify yourself, state your name and your address?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5036.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, you can actually, yes, Mr. Quinn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5120.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I can read it now, but we're actually closing the public comments to go through all of the conditions and the department head comments, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5131.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll highlight this one for the commenter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5135.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pre-demolition and pre-construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5139.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They in our requirement for permit sign off from the board of health, ongoing reports from a licensed pet control company will be required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5145.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That will be a condition upon approval if approval is made to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5167.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5195.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5196.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5197.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure if we're going to keep the sharing going for now or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5209.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5210.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I couldn't see anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5215.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to make sure before I close the comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5218.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5224.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5225.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I'm going to close the comment period now and I'm going to bring it back to the board to see if there's any clarifying, again, any clarifying comments that you are looking for or want to deliberate on now, especially to discuss the criteria for approval under site plan review and the PD special permit and potential conditions for approval actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5252.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5446.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5447.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So before we can even go into this, we have to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5455.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The site plan is actually in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5459.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With the method zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board shall approve a site plan if the board finds that the site plan is consistent with the performance standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5467.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for multiple dwellings or non-residential use described in section 6.4, and that the proposed development meets the standards listed in section 11.710.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5478.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will not read out all of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5479.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, that's where we're pulling from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5481.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, the standards for site plan review listed in section 11.7.10 of the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5488.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're also looking for the criteria for approval for a special permit granting authority may approve the PDU special permit if the SPGA finds that all the following, that there are, I believe there are nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5503.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Alicia, usually Danielle will put these on the screen for the public to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5507.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are nine criteria that need to be met for the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5512.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure if you want to share those for the public or if we can just go over the conditions that need to be discussed and hashed out per the department heads prior to us even getting to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5533.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, there's seven criteria under the site plan, and then there's about nine under the special permit granting agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5540.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And our due diligence would be to make sure that we, that the proponent in the project is covering all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5551.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And based on city department head comments, if we were to approve this, there are conditions that would need to be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5561.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: specifically speaking, 41 conditions in total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5566.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the city at this point will highlight those conditions for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5573.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or Alicia, would you like me to highlight them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5816.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can specifically touch on the water, because that was one of, I had a question, but there's a condition that captures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5852.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the city's coals drainage system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5855.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Applicant shall update the plans to show the overflow pipes and connections, if any, to the city's coals drainage system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5860.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's number 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5861.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=5868.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that will be a condition to get the stormwater permit, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6094.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that would be a question, Attorney Baranski, for the proponent of Mr. Quinn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6203.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Tony Boranski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6205.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari, did you have a further question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6469.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And looking over the conditions, what is the board's temperature on even grant and approval tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6475.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6475.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that we're able to get, are we going to continue this or is this something that you feel comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6485.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with approving or suggesting, recommending for approval to the city council with so many things that are left open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6651.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, thank you for asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6720.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So hearing the city's stance on where they stand with these conditions, as well as the board, at least one board member, and the proponent being amenable to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6734.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: adhering to these conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6737.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review for 96 to 104 Winchester Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6750.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, before we go there, is the board open to add a condition just for the city to explore more on the noise ordinance issue or the noise nuisance issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6763.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that something that we can even condition at this point without having determined what that would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6776.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't everybody answer at once?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6841.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Vice Chair Hedeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6911.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And did we draft, I did not do any notation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6914.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did we draft the actual approval language, the suggested approval language to city council for the noise nuisance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6975.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6978.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was negligent in grabbing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=6980.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Usually I have an open document with the city and I will turn back and see that it's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7130.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7249.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what you're saying is that in exploring and management of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7254.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the mitigation of sound and the city council was to come up with the condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7257.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And therefore the applicant decided that they just wanted to totally remove the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7262.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That could actually trigger a trip back to us for site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7268.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you want to stop that ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7297.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's not a major project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7299.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What determines it to be a major project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7302.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, this is a major project because it's 29 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7371.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Attorney Barofsky, what is your take on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7465.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Try that language one more time, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7467.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A modification or removal of the roof deck will not require a return trip to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7519.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7570.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm just wordsmithing some language here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7603.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for the record, Alicia, I've sent you the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7777.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just at this point, not sure how much we can condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7783.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sort of like a condition that we're not even, I just want to make sure that we make it as easy and transparent for the proponent going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7794.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to add any undue hardship on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7805.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the same time, I want to make sure that we capture it clear here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7809.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's why I'm looking for direction from the city on how to move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7968.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I have a couple of, I have language to read, and I want to make sure that I grab that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7981.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, have you written that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7984.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you share that with me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=7985.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've been along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8014.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hederman has, just before I read them out, she'll be right back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8030.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As soon as we get her back, I will read them out and then we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8036.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8037.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8042.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so this is in reference to 96 to 100 Winchester Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8049.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8057.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are also recommending that the city council explore condition with applicant that includes a requirement for management and mitigation of sound on the roof deck as part of their permanent management document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8070.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any modification or removal which does not expand the roof deck will not be considered a significant site change and may be approved administratively by the Director of Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8083.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8089.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8091.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8095.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Henneman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8098.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter Cowles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8120.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a great evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8152.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The board's saying yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8155.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8157.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8515.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8516.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8521.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, I was on mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8522.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had started reading the agenda item and didn't realize I was on mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8528.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the next item on our agenda is 290 Salem Street, a special permit and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8535.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8539.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on February 21st, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8546.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: via Zoom relative to an application by 290 Salem Street, LLC for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review to permit the construction of a three-story mixed-use building that would contain seven residential units and two ground floor commercial units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8562.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the site known as 290 Salem Street, comprised of properties located at 290 Salem Street and 209 Park Street, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8572.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I believe the staff has some introductory comments on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8700.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8701.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to be clear, we are listening, we are opening up the hearing this evening, but we would not be considering a criteria for approval this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8712.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We will be providing feedback to the proponent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8715.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And with that, I'm gonna ask the applicant to introduce themselves and to present a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8723.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8723.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'm Terry Vonosky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8730.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8981.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Katya has entered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=8986.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, she's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9708.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9708.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I should have actually had you keep up the engineering documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9714.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things of note were the dumpsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9719.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you explain how you could access those two rectangular dumpsters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9747.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So help me understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9750.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I can see how you can get the one next to the car out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9753.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you get the one behind that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9852.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't have the city engineer here to say whether or not that that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9856.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that you had received his.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9860.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: actual comments, is that something that he referenced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9886.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9892.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9892.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, did you have any questions regarding this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9938.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9939.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so going back to the design, if you can go back to the design, actually, and one of the things that was mentioned is that you wanted it to fit into the context of the lot, like the corner of the way that the, not the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9958.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, this was the actual design of the building on the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9962.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I'm looking for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9966.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Back to, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9980.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right there on the corner, it was mentioned how we wanted it to fit into the context of the lot and then play off the buildings across, but how does it fit into the context of everything else that's there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=9992.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we have some site plans to show how it would actually fit into that context, like something from the back, the top, the side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10036.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you don't have them now, it can definitely be for the next time you before the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10108.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10110.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Heidemann, you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10260.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And do you have any actual shadow studies, especially with it being on the corner like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10272.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be something for consideration, just to let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10277.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the comments, actually, that came up with, if you can clarify it, 30% of the usable open space, that was calculated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10287.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it would help if you have a plan that actually clearly shows that open space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10296.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this goes back to engineering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10300.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But before you go, sorry, not to go back and forth, but on this one, on the ground floor, actually, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10316.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How did you calculate the open space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10319.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can clearly show that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10333.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then there were some traffic comments actually, the parking lot allows for at least one, the parking lot should strongly consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10345.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: allowing for parking space associated with commercial uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10355.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's just to enhance the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10394.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that the city is concerned about is that residential parking always takes precedence over the commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10400.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the commercial will have to come back and get like a parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10404.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's strongly recommended that the board requires a parking space for commercial at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10414.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One per unit, allowing for parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10418.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, can you clarify the city's preference for parking there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10687.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10700.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to reiterate Director Hunt's comment, this is a huge opportunity to pretty much live in that ground space for the pedestrian experience at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10712.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Keep that in mind, especially with how it's situated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10829.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10830.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does any of the board members have questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10834.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or any input at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10840.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anything to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10856.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would have to be a date certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10858.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not able to approve anything prior to ZBA's actions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10881.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if ZBA, and I don't want to speak anything into existence or anything like that, but say, for instance, ZBA denies their variance, they're back at square one for a design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=10891.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's not much we can say or review tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11043.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11044.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just keep in mind that we understand that the ZBA needs some kind of design and that it's just a schematic at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11050.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you want to keep in mind how much more of a percentage of design are you going to get to before you bring it before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11058.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we're giving you this information that we're going to be looking for when you come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11090.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, what's the timeline for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11201.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11208.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, because we've legally opened a public hearing, we can also do the public comments and that does not mean that we can't open the public comments again at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11218.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will open them for now if there's members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11224.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Alicia in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11230.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11234.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11237.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11245.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11253.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Depending on the number, we will limit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11255.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As of right now, I don't see any hands, so I will say it was about three minutes per person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11262.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any members from the public present that want to... Alicia, have you received any comments, previous comments or emails or letters on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11364.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the exact number of letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11412.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll take that into record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11415.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to close the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11417.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just keep in mind that we will reopen when there's additional materials to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11424.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, the board's not going to consider criteria for approval on the site plan review and special permit this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11431.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to allow the zoning board to review the variances before completing that process, all those two processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11443.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would not, at this point, I'm not sure if we should deliberate on anything until the proponent is before us, but I'm open to hear what the rest of the board is saying or thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11473.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's my thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11475.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Hederman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11481.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to get the temperature from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11483.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Normally we would still deliberate because we open up the public hearing, but I didn't think it was necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11490.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Allow the proponent to go before the ZBA and then come back before us and then we can save everyone's time there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11499.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will look for a motion to continue the actual address, 290 Salem Street, special permit and site plan review to March 6th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aBgYkA4WX0I&t=11522.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=256.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, uh, just to quickly clarify, uh, the approval of the zoning does not necessarily approve the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4093.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do, before I open it up to others, I have one clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4098.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did not hear more about the noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4100.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to make sure I didn't miss something on noise standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4103.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there was previously, there was a concern with tenants being too close to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4110.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a railroad or something like that, and I want to make sure that we have already accounted for that instance as far as noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4120.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Noise as a nuisance, pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4296.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4296.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4300.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this point, I do know that there was some feedback from the department heads, and I'm not sure if you've all had a chance to read those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4307.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so instead of going through them as the conditions, I'm going to open up to the board to see if the board has any clarifying questions prior to me opening up to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4318.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anyone from the board have questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4324.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4326.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I can please ask, just so that we can see everyone, whoever is sharing the screen, if you can please stop sharing at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4339.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's any members of the board that have questions prior to opening it up to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4346.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any clarifying questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4347.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4354.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a public hearing, so I will now open it up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4361.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4390.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters in the order in which you choose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4633.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I wanna make sure that everyone is limited and able to get through with their comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4645.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4798.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Krause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4872.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Pugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4882.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see any other hands raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4883.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Daniel, do you have public comments to read?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=4987.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, seeing none, I'm going to close the public comments portion and ask the board again if there's any other information that they want to have clarified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5002.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before deliberation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5027.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5028.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5031.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've been remiss on the actual public comments, but I'm hoping that from your end, you can share that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5098.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the legality of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5099.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have to acknowledge it or read the entire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5228.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not to negate any kind of concerns or anything, but as far as not having enough space for a fire truck, I am sure at this point the fire chief would have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5239.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: address that at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5240.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would look to the city to make sure that that was handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5245.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the traffic engineer for the traffic study has accepted the traffic study with conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5253.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As far as the height, the whole idea of it being a zoning amendment was to accommodate the project for a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5262.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not sure how to address the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5267.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: going forward if they've been sufficiently covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5275.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You don't need to respond to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5276.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, I don't want the public to think that we're not taking their concerns into question, but I'm just trying to highlight that these are things that have been fully vetted and addressed by city officials and Method House and in their team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5291.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5386.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I would, if Medford Housing or any of its representatives would like to touch upon any of the concerns that have been placed before them, they're more than welcome to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5397.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5399.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: find it necessary because it has been presented in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5403.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then following up with the conditions, I think that will cover most of the other concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5409.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm going to leave that up to my fellow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5592.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5602.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, at this time, I am going to open up to the board again for clarifying comments and deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5612.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari, I had seen your hand raised first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5618.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to go ahead and speak, Ari?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5771.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5774.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was actually, my question was when I heard that there was not going to be a proposal in traffic mitigation, that's what I want to go back and want to know what the proponent had, if you had had a chance to read the department head comments, or if that was something that we were going to collectively do at the end with conditions, if there was approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5793.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there are a significant amount of conditions that we'll have to go over prior to us being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5801.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: approved site plan or recommend to the city council for a special permit at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5807.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And hearing no other comments from the board, I do know, and based on my review and based on confirmation from the city, the plans have not changed based on what was adopted and recommended by the CDB board, by the city council previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5826.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, if we did want to approve, I'm guessing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5832.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we would be looking at the conditions as presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5836.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if Danielle, I know that in lieu of saying comply with this person's memo dated X or that person's memo, if you can neatly collect them and pretty much go down the line for us so we're all on the same page and understand what those conditions are before the proponent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=5885.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6403.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Driscoll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6546.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Meaning if we were to decide on it as part of the site plan review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6726.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can see that as protecting the natural resources at this point, but I'm just not seeing how it would be incorporated into the site plan review, but maybe definitely the special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6738.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a recommendation, I would like to know the temperature of the rest of the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6772.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Sally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6773.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6819.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as far as the board approving this evening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6824.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's no pressure, because we have the purview to continue till a date certain if there's a lot of information here that you need to digest, especially with hearing new information that has not been shared with the entire PDS staff as of now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6837.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if we feel comfortable, which I can only speak for myself, feel comfortable with knowing that the proponent will work with the department heads and the city, and as long as the proponent is amenable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6851.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to these conditions, that these are not something that they're not amenable to, or what was going to cause an issue or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6858.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But as long as you're willing to work together going forward, I'm okay with the approvals tonight, but I don't know how the board is failing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6897.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much, Attorney Kilson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6971.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so at this point, what I'm looking for is a motion to approve with conditions as set forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6978.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Site plan review for one in three to 20 walk-in court from Merford Housing Authority, and that excludes miscellaneous conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=6988.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not even sure if that's proper language, but approve with conditions minus the miscellaneous condition for site plan approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7004.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7006.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And before we actually do the motion, does that even capture the approval properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7025.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and according to the zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board has approved, has found approval that is consistent with the performance standards as described in section 6.4 of section 11.7.10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7044.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that need to be stated for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7050.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It also meets the proposed development standards as listed in section 11.7.10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7055.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You think that captures it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7071.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: State it out again, and we'll do it one more time, a motion to approve both conditions minus the miscellaneous condition as set forth for the site plan review for one and three to 20 Walkland Court for Medford House with Dawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7100.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7116.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I'm looking for a motion to recommend as a referral board to the city council for plan development district special permit, micro housing authorities one and three to 20 walk on court along with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7228.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so for the board's order of business, the next is approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7251.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A motion to approve, let's see what the minutes are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7255.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7260.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we do them collectively or do they have to be called out individually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7338.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7343.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the next item, miscellaneous or any other updates that the city may want to share with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7762.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to put a shameless but very, very beneficial plug out for CPTC, the Citizens Planner Training Collaborative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7770.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're having our annual conference at the Holy Cross on Saturday, March 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7775.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I say we because I'm a board member, and it's been a lifesaver for me, especially being a new board member previously and not working at the local, being a planner but not working directly in a local level and knowing how to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7788.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: handle municipal planning and land use and that's pretty much what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7792.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It trains up planning boards and municipal planning staff on the use of land, on land use, like the newest trends and part of what the annual conference, what I like about the annual conference as opposed to like just the webinars or the on-demand training<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7809.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that there's going to be everything there you mentioned emily and she's doing like a site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7813.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, this is a shameless plug for march 16th It's I think not only for your staff alicia, but for the so but not that you want to give up your saturday like I am um, but It's a wealth of information that um that people can really get into you who's going forward here on the board or In your planning career like if you are a plan I agree i've been i've attended those in the past and um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7913.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course there's not, Alan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7916.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Only because they were so, it's like, get the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7922.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's like you wanted everyone to save the date, but it's like you're going to have to save the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7925.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You got to build up this interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7926.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You got to go to the thing and we're still trying to figure out where to plug people in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7930.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're still trying to get keynote speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7932.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Last year, we were able to get the lieutenant governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7934.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We jumped on her because, you know, she was coming into office and she's a planner, literally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7940.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, she's a lawyer, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7943.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: she's she's a planner so and it's one of those things where she loved the opportunity so she came right into it being you know in her role but now we can't even get a keynote so we're trying to figure everything out this year and we said don't put anything on the on the website don't tell anyone about the registration and it looks like they did so i'm telling you word of mouth because i didn't think that there was anything on the website yet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7967.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But just more of a state of the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7970.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, but Alicia, if you want, I can pretty much email you what's on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7975.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like I know MBTA communities and 3A and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7979.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a lot of interest that planners have said over the course of these sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7986.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I pride myself in being a planner, and I have AICP, but at the same time, I lose my skills because I don't use it at the local level the way you guys do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=7993.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And being in this role right now, it's like I'm always, I feel so intimidated because I'm with these other chairs sitting around Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8001.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm like, oh, they're going to know so much more than me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8002.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I sat next to someone who was like, are you excited about 3A legislation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8006.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He was like, what's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8007.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm like, oh, so I do know more than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8010.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, that's impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8012.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is hugely needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8014.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to humble myself and say there's a lot of things I'm still learning, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8018.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Boys just need it, boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8042.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is different from the webinar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8043.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In our conference now, not only is it in Worcester and Central Massachusetts, but you do get fed, like Daniel said, but it's an all-day event, 8 to 3.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8053.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we've gone up to $100 for the registration now, just to let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8059.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when you said it's still pretty much affordable, but it's a little bit more than what people- You know, APA charges like $1,800 for registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8070.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And except for the core courses, like the comprehensive planning, zoning, and things like that, you get AICP credits, if you're AICP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8078.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if anyone cares about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8079.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to let everyone know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8081.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to drone on and on about that, but I did want to send that plug out, especially when Alicia mentioned Emily Ennis, because she is there, and some of the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8091.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: people that are hands-on with helping planners, like Julie Barrett, they'll be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8098.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My agency is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8100.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't get the secretary to do economic development plan, but we are going to do a one-stop session like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8106.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's AICP credit, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8124.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm definitely definitely zoning board of appeals and, and planning board officials, pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8148.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, there's this real cool one this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8150.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're doing a Laurel and Hardy go to planning school pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8153.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's going to be a play on how you arrive at that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8156.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8157.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyways, again, not to hold you up any longer, but I just wanted to throw that out there because I thought it was pretty awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8196.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8198.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8200.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so hearing no other updates, a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8226.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Ari Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8229.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8236.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8238.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8239.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good night, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TnJNLyjh-qU&t=8240.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=75.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=77.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=84.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=87.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=88.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Danielle, you can introduce any staff on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=99.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=102.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so first meet an agenda, Daniel, can you remind me while I am still fumbling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=242.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I saw some that were old and it referenced... It's just to answer the open meet and laugh, the temporary provisions have been extended by Governor Haley until March 31st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=256.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 2025, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=257.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was hoping it was 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=319.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=320.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Composition of the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=323.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, this has been given to each board member since as, as brought on, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=330.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=336.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was the intention, so I'm not sure where that was left at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=373.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I definitely think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=376.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can only speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=377.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It warrants us to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=379.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just I didn't know how much we would get through it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=381.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=384.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things I want to be clear on is that we definitely have to do some adjustments, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=390.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's even administrative sort of things with the filing of applications and shutting them down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=399.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had discussed that previously as a board, just going forward and, like, you don't want to get something on a Friday night and then have to, like, scramble to read it over the weekend for the following week, kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=413.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=439.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, and just giving the board some time to digest it and see if there's anything that you can recommend or that you want to discuss as a group on what can be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=491.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=533.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I mean, I just- Yeah, not so much a motion at this point, but I'm interested in knowing the feedback from other board members, and it just can be, again, how it'll go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=546.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I'm sure no one, you're not going to be able to take this in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=550.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might go away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=552.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and be like, oh, we should have said this, we should have said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=557.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, it's like Daniel said, it's more of an open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=588.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is good information, because from my understanding, this would be given to every new board member as part of their onboarding, and it sounds like no one has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=616.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So make sure that all board members have it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=620.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=640.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying, but at the same time, I'm a little, since we have a meeting and we're open, I'm trying to just get more feedback from other board members and not just like, just my hearing myself for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=668.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's, that's pretty much my feeling from the beginning, but I just want to make sure that I'm not like tabling it and other people wanting to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=677.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in that case, I guess we can just, if someone wants to give the motion, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=702.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=707.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=708.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=709.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Mariansky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=711.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=712.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=712.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=715.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, she's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=716.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sharad Bhattacharya?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=720.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=722.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm an aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=725.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the next item, Daniel, was fee schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=732.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to lead us in discussion on what you were thinking with the fee schedules?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1054.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1148.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1150.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are planned board, but it's up to the office of, uh, it's up to Daniel's office to make sure that we're in compliance with, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1158.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the amounts that we can charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1161.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1162.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like Danielle has done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1167.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like, um, whatever the fees or just, like, just, like, develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1173.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I'm not mistaken, Danielle, it's the same, like, if we were charging developer, like, some kind of fee or something like that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1178.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to make sure that we're in compliance and that we're not overcharging for certain things, or is this more administrative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1431.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, Katie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1434.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For myself, going back to something Emily said, I didn't... I guess I mixed this up with, like, developer impact fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1441.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, that can be... that can violate Fifth Amendment if we don't... because it's regulatory, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1446.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to make sure that we're within reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1448.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so since this is more like an administrative kind of staff thing, it's just building a case for us to pretty much adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1455.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess we just need a little bit more information on... Obviously, we know it's going to impact<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1461.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the city somewhat for the deficit, but just give us something to vote on, I think, a little bit more background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1468.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see you did the research, but I would love to know, like, what we're charging versus another one, another community that's near us or something like that, just to see where we're at in comparison, just so that people have more confidence to vote on what you're presenting, because, again, this should still be, to me, a city staff kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1491.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But since it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1498.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1499.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to be rude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1500.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going off camera just to grab my plug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1502.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not going to turn the camera off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1504.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just going to jump up and grab my plug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1556.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, I just I'm trying to work from two different and I just can't see everyone because it's suppressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1562.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1629.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, for this item itself, just because, I mean, I don't want to be the odd one out, but I'm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1635.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I definitely have an idea of how low our fees are already, but I have more of an advantage based on dealing with other cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1644.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the fact that we are so low, but I don't want that to be a reason why I'm ready to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1650.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would need the entire board to feel confident and vote in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1656.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my biggest questions to Danielle was just what does that entail to bring you guys to confidence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1669.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, without me even saying that I know other communities and what they charge, the fact that this hasn't been done in 1974, since 1974, that's a reason to up them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1681.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what do we up them to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1683.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going high enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1718.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's exactly where I came to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1721.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we even going high enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1722.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And will we have to revisit this again to go higher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1724.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we be doing this a second time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1947.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, the linkage fees are the same as impact fees, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=1950.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's allowed through special... I will tell you legally, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2000.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2003.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 1, 2nd, and my question regarding the link histories, because we're tabling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2007.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone had asked earlier if we can table the link histories and be separate and I wanted to make sure and Alicia had responded saying that you needed a study and everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2017.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted the board to have a full understanding that that was like a regulatory thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2021.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or if it was through legislation or if it's something that we can even discuss going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2026.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make sure that that was clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2028.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Alicia has answered that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2031.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, I guess us voting tonight would be, it would definitely take linkage fees off the table, but what does that look for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2039.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What does that look like for us going forward anyways?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2069.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2078.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And going back to Emily's question, um, to move the board forward, what do we need to establish tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2086.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, are we voting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2089.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there, are we in a position to vote or are we tabling this to the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2098.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's me opening it up to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2129.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm sorry, I had loosely heard, we didn't put it in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2134.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't capture it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2135.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But basically, the conversation had bounced back, like, I don't know, give it a date, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2141.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I like Emily's idea of maybe like rolling this out in a month, get given some time, and then, you know, let them know that it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2150.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then maybe look at it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2151.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it'd be more incremental later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2154.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But right now, roll this out, and give them time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2247.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, Peter has joined us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2249.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, did you hear enough to even?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2267.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But no, don't worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2269.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it took my husband and I nearly 40 minutes to get from Medford to Medford tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2276.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We went to get pizza and avelinos and we couldn't get home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2282.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm exaggerating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2283.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't 40 minutes, but it was forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2285.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to do the word play again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2294.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could try one more time, Ari, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2311.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2315.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2317.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2334.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. Okay, and we have minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2342.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item on the agenda is minutes for, is it from 11?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2346.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2356.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, I have two prep documents open here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2368.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, is there a motion to approve the minutes from 11-15-23?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2371.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2389.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was gonna abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2392.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to let you know, going forward, one of the things that I've learned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2399.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Even if you weren't there, you're just voting the minutes to be filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2406.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct, Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2407.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2408.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2430.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2433.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and before adjournment, there's, are there any miscellaneous or other updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2438.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, is this where you want to discuss the meeting schedule for 2024, Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2663.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this just, I mean, it works for me, but I want to make sure this, is this a date that we're still, because I remember we changed them to accommodate schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2673.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Emily, are you still in school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2675.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not to put you out, just anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2677.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that this still works for everyone and that you don't need to change it for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2699.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've tried to accommodate members as much as possible going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2703.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like if there was something else that there was a conflict and we wanted to make sure and you would never be able to be there, then obviously we want to look at a date that we get most of our board members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2713.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seemed like Wednesday we fell on where everyone could pretty much be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2718.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now that there's new members, I just want to make sure that that's still the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2721.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also want to make sure that it's still a good day for the former board members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2832.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2833.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm happy that you're fully staffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2852.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, for my eldest daughter, it's her birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Di2Vz73jrg&t=2903.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm an aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2595.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oop, there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2599.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've not been on this side of the rail too often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2602.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this all seems vaguely familiar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2606.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2612.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2619.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2625.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: once fellow school committee members and school committee elect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2628.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations to you, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2631.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2651.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2655.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2659.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, a couple of words kept on coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2663.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, diligent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2665.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2676.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just amazing dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2678.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2691.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: posts and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2696.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So hello to Noah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2698.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2704.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You really deserve it, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2705.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2708.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2715.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not blunt, but moral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2720.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2735.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2745.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I so appreciated that from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2748.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2754.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2764.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, congratulations to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2766.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2770.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2782.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2789.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2792.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2796.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually have to go back and figure it out sometime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2800.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Educational Foundation was started<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2804.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: way long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2818.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2823.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ann Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2835.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Today, tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2851.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2865.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or another grant from $200 to $2,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2869.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we accept those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2872.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then as a body, we deliberate on the grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2876.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We check out with the schools that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2879.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2888.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2902.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2917.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2931.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2947.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2956.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2961.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2967.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2980.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And... This is Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2981.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean, stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2985.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2995.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This connection between us and Jean was because of Mia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3001.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3006.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you can see, our requests are steadily increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3010.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, it's, you know, we need more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3012.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need more money, Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3016.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3030.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3040.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3045.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3053.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: David Sayers, David<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3056.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: coordinates all the grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3057.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the second row, Stephen Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3060.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Stephen Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3063.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, we have been working with Gerry McCue and Noel Velez right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3070.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3078.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So here's the check and they're not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3080.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3086.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3097.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So now I can officially hand it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3101.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Steve should really be up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3114.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So our treasurer, Steve, is very diligent and tracking all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3120.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, we hope after we closed our time period for receiving the grants, we received several more on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3130.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other place where we've had donations, apart from private donations, which we also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3136.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: solicit and accept happily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3138.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Fund has also been generous to us, and I want to acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3144.196s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, it's great to see you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3146.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a great night, and thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=117.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a continued public hearing to consider and vote on our recommendations to city council regarding the zoning overlay to comply with the MBTA community zoning law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=126.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the last meeting, the board members were supportive of the proposed overlay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=130.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, there was discussion regarding the appropriate parking minimums and maximums, such as reducing parking minimums to 0.5 spaces per unit or requiring no parking minimums at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=140.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We asked staff to model the unit capacity yields for the 0.5 spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=145.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the city has reported back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=148.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, if you want to highlight that, and if the board wants to start deliberations from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=458.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have the, is it the Downtown Trout Work Zoning Study?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=461.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that the slides that Daniel shared?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=616.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Emily, do you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=689.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=691.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I echo Emily, 1 of the things that I stand firm with, and I understand that the city has, you know, you take away park and even with transit oriented development, then you'll still see a spillover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=701.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the same time, it's like the whole idea of it being compliant and dealing with the transit oriented is that we're trying to prioritize people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=709.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: over cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=710.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I am all for the more housing units that we can get on a property, whether they're built or not, but removing that barrier and offering that incentive for a developer to take up if they so choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=724.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's where my stance is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=725.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know if there's any other questions that's leading up to us and what we need to do for recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=732.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as far as maximum parking, I would say we definitely want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=738.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm all for bringing it down under the 1.5 maximum if needed, but I don't know how the board feels about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=746.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is just picking up on what we were talking about at the previous meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=749.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if anyone had any comments on the maximum parking or if there's any other comments on the parking overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=832.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also still definitely keeping in mind equity for people that actually really need to utilize those spaces, whether it's a disability or they're caring for someone or whatever the reason is, we're still allowing it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=845.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not going into zero, but so we're making notice that, yeah, parking is needed, but again, minimal parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=864.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so, Danielle, I know that you wanted us to sort of give some feedback on developer incentives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=872.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did anyone have any further discussion on how you thought the incentives played out in the amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=884.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or any additional thoughts from what was captured at the last meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=904.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or if you wanted to add anything to Daniel's suggested or not suggested, but they're captured development incentive bonuses, or are you fine with how they are as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=924.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the board ready to vote on a recommendation for the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=930.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it, it's the approval of the amendment for the zoning overlay to send to City Council or to recommend to City Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1005.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1006.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's my oversight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1007.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually, this is a continuation of a public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1010.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I absolutely do, before we go on with the vote, I want to open up to the public, whether there's members representing the public or not, just to give them the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1022.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I will open up the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1026.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1031.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1035.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Individuals may have up to three minutes to provide comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1038.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1043.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1050.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and C-staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1059.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1062.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And once that's done, if you, Alicia or Danielle, if you have anything that you want to read, emails or letters, or even if you want to, I know that we had one at the previous meeting, if you want to read that out again, I'm not sure if it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1199.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, with that said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1207.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: close the public comment period and come back to the board and sort of try to piece this all together and decide which scenario we are going to recommend to city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1217.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're going to all recommend to city council, are we going to do 0.5 and drop a story, which is four stories or keep 0.85 stories for minimum parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1231.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we will have to decide on one of those scenarios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1234.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What was presented was the original<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1237.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 0.5 with four stories, or are we going to 0.8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1244.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Originally, it was 0.8 with five stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1246.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to go to 0.5 and drop a story, four stories?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1252.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1281.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because the zoning amendment has been presented for us, this is where we can actually change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1288.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we would be voting collectively at the end for whatever we decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1293.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: care for whatever we rectify here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1296.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct, Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1298.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't have to do a motion for which we're choosing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1301.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We just have to actually do a motion for whatever the recommendation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1329.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or we can recommend to keep it active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1421.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Number seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1512.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The actual recommendation of city council is not just to approve, but also to adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1517.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's two different motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1523.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the motion I would be looking for from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1596.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1600.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to clarify, Robin's rules are she would have had to have watched it previous to tonight's meeting and had signed off saying that she watched it and then she can continue tonight and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1614.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1694.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1695.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, we would need a motion to recommend to City Council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1707.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As amended, for the parking spaces, are we doing 0.8 or 0.5?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1712.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would be more of a discussion for the board to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1718.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, what was your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1732.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess it's not really a roll call, but if I, if I, I guess, call out, then you can tell me what your voice is for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1738.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Park and minimums and maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1751.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1752.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1762.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you voting to amend it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1763.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We discussed at the last meet, and it was originally 0.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1768.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was originally 0.8 with five stories, and are we amending it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1773.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we keeping that for minimums, or are we going to 0.5, four stories?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1815.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, Sally, also for your maximum, are you at 1.5 or 1.2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1824.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1839.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're not going to vote to recommend that at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1848.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1855.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Marianski?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1868.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and then myself for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1870.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1872.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=1873.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry, Ari.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2039.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's where we got into the development incentives and how that played into the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2044.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm almost positive, but Sharad can share more of his side of that's where he was a little apprehensive about with the density and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2126.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe the city responded, please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the area outside of that is already planned for, the city has planning goals for like commercial and lab space, not residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2140.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's pretty much why moving to another part of the city is not really feasible with compliance for one or with the city's planning goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2147.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so as highlighted by Danielle with the previous meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2452.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2511.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that being said, I want to make sure that we're all, I guess, even for myself, I inadvertently assumed that the 0.55 stories was given us more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2523.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure how we got that backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2680.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then remind me of the affordable units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2683.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's affordable units, it has to be set at 0.5, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2835.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm assuming that that's pretty much where the rest of the board was coming from too, 0.8, because it's not written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2841.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just a barrier removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2842.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They can do what they can, but then it's more so the maximum that we were really looking to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2849.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we wanted to bring it down to 0.8 to give them the option, even if it's not something that they pick up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2854.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So 0.8 for minimum, and then perhaps 1.2 for maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2855.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that's where I landed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2868.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it looks like Ari landed there, as did Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2877.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's three of us, but we have Sally with 1.5 maximum, and Pam with 1.5 maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2888.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Sherrod, Emily abstaining, and Sherrod, a no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2906.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, so now we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2907.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I guess, so let me just let me try this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2928.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So are we prepared to vote on a recommendation with the motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington station multifamily overlay district as amended to 0.8, which is five stories for minimum parking and 1.2 for maximum parking and making sure to add the Y<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2954.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for non-commercial greenhouse, tool shed, or similar assessment structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2961.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did I get that right, Alicia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=2975.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was originally 0.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3048.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for myself, I'm not a transportation planner, but dealing in economic development and some of the things that I know that goes into the traffic engineering and everything that comes with developers and their incentives, I'm willing to keep it at 1.8 to keep it attractive, even though, I mean, I don't know how the board feels about going to 0.5 at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3119.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we don't want the city to lose an economic development planner before they get them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3132.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess am I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3134.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to reiterate here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3557.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's what I'm just trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3559.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm trying to stay out as much as the conversation as possible, because as you know, just what would be in my previous agency, well, now that we're separated, the whole idea of it being an MBTA rule is to eliminate parking minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3574.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm trying not to be too heavy handed on my,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3579.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: my share and why I think it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3583.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I prefer for the boards to deliberate and for us to get to an agreement of what the minimum parking is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3600.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3601.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I like I said, I just I allow you to go I it this is great for other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3606.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's even you know, great for the members of the audience, the public and even myself just to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3611.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I already know that I am sort of biased in where I sit, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3683.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm looking more at the maximums than I am at the minimums, but it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3690.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we would be amending to so we were at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3693.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We were asking for a vote to recommend just to get a little bit more of the boys temperature again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3700.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Peter, you're now saying 0.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3702.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to be clear, can the city clarify what the actual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3713.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: parking minimums around other transit areas in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3774.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I can go with either the 0.8 or 0.5 for minimums, but I'm definitely, my vote is for the 1.2 for maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3782.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess we just have to come back to agreement because as of right now, we only have Ari and Peter that are saying 0.5 for minimums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3791.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have to get that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3825.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, based on what he's already shared with us, I deduce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3832.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, Ari for minimum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3899.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sam?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3925.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So yeah, I'm the same for me for the minimums, either 0.8 to 0.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3929.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I definitely hear that, especially myself taking MBTA from where I sit, we're not at a point where Medford can just start dropping parking spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3941.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the same time, even though I think I'm less than, I'm a little bit over half a mile, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3948.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: even I can get to Wellington station easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3951.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the fact that this is like right there in the Wellington station area, that's not one of my biggest concerns, and I will stand by my 1.2 for maximum, but I can be swayed for 0.8, 0.5 for minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3967.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So looking at that overall, if I was to change to 0.5 to keep it, it would be Peter, myself and Ari,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3978.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have the same numbers as does PAM, so that's four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3984.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's voting for 0.5 minimum, 1.2 maximum to get it passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=3995.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in that case, we would be amending because it came in at 0.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4000.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're looking for a motion to recommend to city council that they approve the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4007.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the amendments for 0.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4009.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's 0.5 minimum parking and 1.2 maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4020.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then add the Y to the use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4034.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4040.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll do a roll call with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4045.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have Peter Cowles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4048.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4050.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4051.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Marionski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4053.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4054.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4057.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4058.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes, and we have one no, which is Sharad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4063.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't get your no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4064.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we've heard your no, Sharad, but I should have called you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4070.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4072.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have five yeses for the recommendation to city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4093.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have a motion to recommend to city council that they approved the Wellington station multifamily overlay district with the amendments to from 0.8 spaces from 0.5 spaces per dwelling to 0.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4107.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, there's 0.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4117.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From 0.8 to 0.5, Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4119.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4121.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you go from 0.5 to 0.8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4123.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not keeping it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4124.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're changing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4124.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4128.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're amending it from 0.8 to 0.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4131.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4135.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4136.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we're also amending the maximum from 1.5 to 1.2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4143.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we're adding a yes to the use table where it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4146.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do I have to spell that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4148.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's based on my table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4151.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's number 7 for non-commercial greenhouse to shed or similar accessory structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4175.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that a sufficient motion or recommendation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4180.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, we have five yeses and one abstention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4193.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tomorrow, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4196.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have the next item on the agenda is approval of minutes, but we have none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4204.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll go to the next item, which is miscellaneous and other updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4516.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you're looking to get like members of the community as well for the steering committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4594.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the role in zoning with the comprehensive plan, I'm trying to see how will this, because zoning is the land use like laws that inform the comprehensive plan that we just did with the steering committee, which I love being on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4609.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So how will that change the comprehensive plan going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4612.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will it, it's going to have a huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4623.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4627.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you need the zoning changes to actually implement the comprehensive plan as visioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4813.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't realize we had so many regulatory changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4816.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I was so romanticized by the idea of having a collaborative vision of the community that I didn't realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4822.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now we have to work backwards to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4825.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I knew we had to, because obviously, being part of it, there were some things that just doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4832.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't realize now we got to actually change the rules to match the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4985.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4995.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is one of the longest shortest meetings ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=4997.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5025.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as long as we don't talk about anything on the agenda that's coming up or has passed, we're good, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5032.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know who would initiate that, like, just send you an email and say, hey, this will be awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BXgn2s6XE&t=5055.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, wait a minute, let's back up for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=229.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so for, um, the city staff that's present, um, um, Danielle, you want to take the lead on the proposed ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1357.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll stop sharing my screen for the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1361.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Daniel, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1363.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the questions I wanted before you went through is, can you explain to the board and to the public exactly why this district was chosen and how it relates to, like for instance, why not West Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1380.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why not Medford Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1382.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why is it at Wellington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1476.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Alicia, one of the things that I was hoping that can be illustrated here is myself as a planner and knowing more about the law, the MBTA law and how it is, I know, and just speaking with the city that moving it, moving it to another part of it, the city is not feasible with compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1492.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if you can paint out what that looks like for the audience, for the public and for the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1912.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because this is one of the questions that I have, and I think one of the only other questions that I have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1922.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I'll open it up for the board for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1926.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's the parking minimums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1927.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since we're doing this in a transit oriented development and we have 0.5 at this point, and we can actually really go big and create more density.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1941.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No parking minimums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1942.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Get rid of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1944.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that feasible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1945.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1948.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I'm not mistaken, Danielle, you've ran the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1953.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you share with the board what that would mean if we were to get rid of the parking limit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2129.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I guess I'm not sure if I'm alone in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2132.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand your reservation on it, but we, our car dependency is the reason why we're in trouble with the house insurance now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2140.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just saw it as an opportunity just to not to be so car dependent, but I can also understand on the other side, because I happen to live in one of those apartment buildings near Homel that you just referenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2263.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any other board input on parking minimums or anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2267.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there thoughts on the actual development incentive bonuses that Danielle wanted input on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2421.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, actually, that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2423.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2426.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: against car dependency that one of the things that made it a little bit more humbling was I attended a conference where there was someone with a disability who had kept saying, you know, you keep talking about no parking, no parking, but what about my caretakers that come to take care of me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2453.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so it's currently at 0.5, Danielle, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2624.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where I live, if you have, you can have two spaces per unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2630.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's like, I don't know, there's different levels because we have a garage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2636.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not part, it becomes part of my rent if I take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2641.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I don't want any, if I want no parking, then it's not part of my rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2645.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm guessing that that's what the idea is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2940.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, thank you, Danielle, because one of the things, and it does seem, and we understand where the city's, I understand where the city's situation is, but it's also very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2952.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: important and pertinent to let the board know that you're expecting to vote by 12-6-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2958.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if that's the case, then we're going to have to hold another special meeting because who's going to do Thanksgiving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4012.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While you have that up, Alicia, I think I'm going to open it up for public comment in case the public has any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4020.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the board doesn't have any questions at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4080.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was one, and the resident is present this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4350.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle or Alicia, do you want to address either of those questions by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4479.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mr. Matarazzo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4600.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Matarazzo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4912.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one thing I think I should mention, and only because it's a public hearing and Mr. Matarazzo brought it up as far as leveraging private development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4920.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make a public disclaimer that myself being a senior program manager for the MassWorks Infrastructure Program, I am in no way consulting with the city on leveraging state grants administered by the Executive Office of Economic Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4933.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just wanted to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4935.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, Mr. Matarazzo, congratulations to you and the town of Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4939.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4949.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have any other public comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4961.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4962.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to close the public comment section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4966.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm going to come back to the board and see if you want to deliberate or just further discuss the drive zoning ordinance amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4974.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that we're prepared to vote or if even the city is asking for a vote this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4979.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there is a couple of things that they want to get ironed out with Emily Enns, which is Emily Keyes Enns, who is the consultant for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4987.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if there's any other questions that we want to give the city now, or we can email,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4993.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess we should get this date certain on the board if that's on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5014.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5387.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The city of Somerville has parking caps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5388.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They have parking maximums on their line, on the orange line for Assembly Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5393.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wonder how, but I guess that's more car dependent over there because it's a huge commercial area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5401.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5404.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Destination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5405.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5406.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But even that, with that, they have parking caps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5414.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5417.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not so much concerned with the maximum, the parking maximum, but if we can decrease it a little bit somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5423.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then I guess I would be interested in knowing what the benefits are if there are any, but if there's not a significant incremental change, then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5441.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess just so that the board is able to vote with confidence to supply that information, Danielle, so that board members can just look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5453.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so what... And I guess we can decide on the next date, and then between now and...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5473.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now and then we can send you other questions via email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5534.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, any questions or suggested edits, as I agree with Peter, any questions or suggested edits should be able to be ironed out prior to, without another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5566.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we need a motion to for a day starting to 12, to continue to 12, 6, 2023?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5938.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The long-term blasting over there at Windsor Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6037.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Felicia, I feel like I know that you use mass planners here and there, but I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6042.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I feel loyal to the state that I'm not supposed to be, like, doing all this advertising for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6048.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I feel like if you use that, there's tons of people that will see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6053.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that you don't get enough chance, but they're always talking about it amongst themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6057.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The planners are talking about it across the state when you use that platform, the mass planners platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6098.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I definitely can, I say it verbally, but I feel like, I don't know if I put it on my LinkedIn, like my friends hire and I don't know, I just, I don't think there's a conflict of interest there, but it's just, it just feels weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6158.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, that would be huge, only because as an alum, I get those updates all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6162.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can tell you that if I do know of anyone, that's one of the first places I look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6167.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because UEP is really good about doing a blast for alums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6173.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6174.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For current and especially alums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6192.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just being with the city, that's your end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6207.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it just wouldn't be great only because I keep seeing different communities go by me every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6211.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So every time like, I wonder if Medford's using that because I'm like, Oh, Lexington is looking for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6215.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, Burlington's looking for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6216.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's like, where's Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6218.196s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's like Medford's not saying anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6249.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is Ari's favorite part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6250.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6253.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ari, not to put you out there like that, because I guess it's probably at this point, especially with the long meet, and it's probably everyone, so I don't mean to throw you out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6263.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, I'll present the motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=6268.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=135.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's continued from 10-4-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=653.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can either adopt, amend, disagree, or totally change them as you wish to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=661.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure if you've all had a chance to look at them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=665.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I will open it up for deliberation now from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=848.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while we do that, I'm going to close the public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1168.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what would be the proper way to condition it so that it doesn't provide undue burden onto the proponent if it's something that we can't determine at this juncture now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1431.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the board okay with number five as written after hearing what has been presented by the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1653.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Mr. Powell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1657.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1658.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1662.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't have anything further, I'm going to ask comments from the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1758.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because it's straightforward, technically all we're doing is, as you said, it's a formality where we're certifying that it's an approval not required because in this case, the city can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1769.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it meets all the criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1770.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, for me, I don't know if there's any questions from the board, but I can just ask for a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1781.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since the city has affirmed that the criteria has been met, I'll ask for a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1787.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although there's no approval needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1794.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess we're just making sure that we're all in agreement just by doing a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1799.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that what it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1800.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A motion to affirm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1804.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A motion to certify that there's approval not needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1811.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so actually, I guess I need a motion first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1816.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make a motion to affirm that approval is not needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1819.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1821.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1932.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our next item is approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1939.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that everyone, so we have 9-6-23 and then 9-20-23 was added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1944.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did everyone get a chance to read the additions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1949.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know if I can do this collectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1951.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we do it in one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1953.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or just say, I'm asking for a motion to approve draft minutes from 9-6 and 9-20 meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1961.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As long as there's no discussion, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1964.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, as long as there's no discussion on either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1966.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I will ask for a motion to approve the draft minutes from 9-6-23 and 9-20-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW4F81PsmNk&t=1976.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My motion for approval is 9-6-2-10-18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=132.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=133.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So our first item on the agenda for today is a special permit drive-through use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=138.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bank of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=141.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was continued from 9-20-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=144.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is applying for a special permit for a bank with drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the Wagons Plaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=152.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The special permit grant authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the city board for the board's recommendation on the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=158.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The matter has been continued several times in order to redesign the site plan to satisfy planning staff and for sign off from other tenants of the shopping plaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=170.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: An overall project summary is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Leonard Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=182.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The proposed project will construct an approximate 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-through lane and one drive-through bypass lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=191.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to now invite the applicant to present any updates to the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=196.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please introduce all members of the applicant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=271.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think it's a motion to table it to the end of the meet or later in the meet and just to another date certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=296.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=297.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to go to the next item on our agenda, which is 590 Boston Ave site plan review amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=302.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is applying for an amendment to the previously approved site plan, special permit, and variances for the construction of a mixed use building that will contain 45 residential units and approximately 1,464 square feet of retail space with parking at grade located at the property 590 Boston Ave, Medford Mass, 02155.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=323.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The original project was approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals in July 2021, but the design has been slightly revised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=329.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is invited to present to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=333.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you please introduce the applicant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1450.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1452.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that I need, I guess, clarity from, I'm not sure if it's from the city or from the applicant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1458.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can just synthesize the information, you've gone over in detail, but we're trying to see where we're at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1465.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know, we understand that we no longer need a parking variance and we, and there was, we, I could see the differences in the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1473.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm trying to better understand where we stand right now in reference to compliance with the department heads comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1480.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, um, I guess in the variances, if the city can pretty much point that out, I know that this was approved previously in 2020 with lots of conditions, but I'm having a hard time synthesizing all the information as you're presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1496.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if someone can just give us a high level, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1499.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: overview of exactly what variances that we're looking at right now and how far they are from compliance with the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1507.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1515.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you had a chance to look at the department head comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1764.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ask the city if you have any comments or if you want to add anything to better help the public and the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1777.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From your point of view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1782.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, no, the city at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1784.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1964.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the questions I have for clarification, previously when this was approved, there were conditions that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1972.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we would recommend with at least six units being affordable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=1977.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that still on the table or has it been taken on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2002.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2227.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2228.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2228.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to go to the board now and I just want to remind the public at this point or actually inform the public at this point to please remain refrain from using the chat at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2239.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to do a public comment period soon as we hear from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2282.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2283.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's pretty much what I was trying to get a high level bullet point of is what we hit and what we haven't just to get it synthesized so that we can know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2290.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so I guess as a board, we will decide if we have enough information to continue, or if this is something that we can approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2299.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, I, I'm not sure that I'm comfortable at this point myself recommending with conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2304.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause I'm not sure what those conditions would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2307.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and what they would not be, unless the city can help us with some language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2312.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But even then, we have to satisfy the affordable housing piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=2396.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to inject my two cents into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4086.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Ari.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4087.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4087.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4173.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's a, see where the board is at now for deliberations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4178.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you all comfortable with moving forward with the recommendation to the ZBA or are we looking to table this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4187.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think some of the, a lot of the questions that I had was the previous conditions for myself and where they stood, but we've already heard from the applicant that they're willing to comply as necessary with all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4203.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: department had comments and then the process of affordability I can be handled with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4207.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm confident in handling that with the city, but I want to know what other board members are feeling at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4217.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4221.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. Quinn, I think, are you sharing your screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4225.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could stop sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4230.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4311.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so because we're making advisory recommendations, I guess at this point, I wanna be clear, Danielle, we are going with the previous conditions as well as a couple of new conditions, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4326.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the city wants to help us get this language proper so that someone can even<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4330.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, are you able to capture conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4424.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then that the proponent at this point, number three may be mute because the proponents should work with the city engineer to provide the additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4432.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, it's working with the city engineer as well as the fire chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4436.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I thought that was all encompassing with number four, which is compliance with recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4441.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to the satisfaction of each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4443.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to make sure that we're fleshing out everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4446.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because if we're going to discuss each department head, it should be all inclusive, unless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4637.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4637.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, and that, and so instead of piecing, parsing that out to be its own item, it should be, um, all inclusive and number four for all department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4776.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so as far as Gordon, that just, that also covers inclusionary housing at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4781.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, that was called out separately originally, but it should just be compliant with the city as necessary because it's mandatory and not necessarily a condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4816.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So yeah, so we're looking for a motion to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves the special permit for the site plan review for 590 Boston Ave with the following conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4830.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4900.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the city does not have anything to add on that language, we can go ahead and who wants to do the first motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4919.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that's the one key word I left out was amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4923.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I originally said to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4926.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're recommending that the Board of Appeals approves the amended special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=4934.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that what it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5304.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He will assist the board in making any revisions to the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5307.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Board members should feel free to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5310.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We now ask the applicant for Walkman Court to introduce themselves and present their proposal, mainly highlighting and pointing out the differences of what that will include of what's allowed there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5323.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: um, what's there now and what will be allowed there for the PDD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5328.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, do you want to introduce, um, the applicant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5368.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, if you have a presentation, you can introduce yourself as you go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5372.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=5698.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to just remind, as you go through, and I apologize for the interjection, is when you get to acronyms, if you can please just help the public and spell out any acronyms that may be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7330.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, when I conclude your presentation, I'm going to open it up to the city staff to add anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7338.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any questions from the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7365.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7365.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In that case, are there any questions clarifying questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7389.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7395.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7659.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, actually, um, uh, Shirab for that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7663.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and that, and that second part, I think that that would be more related in site plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7667.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, and one of the things I want to remind the board of tonight is that the discussion is limited to amendment questions surrounding language in recommending, um, the zoning ordinance back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7678.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, um, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7680.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to defer to Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7684.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think I saw your hand up if you want to add something there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7729.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much attorney, so staying again, just to recap approval of the zoning doesn't necessarily approve the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7735.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We still have to do our due diligence with the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7739.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we will save that for then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7743.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7745.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do you have any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7749.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7749.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7755.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7756.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7759.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I am going to open it up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7765.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7770.196s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7775.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Individuals may have up to two minutes to provide comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7778.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7782.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please do not use the staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7785.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record and just so that the public understands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7789.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why the chat feature has been disabled so that we can capture all of your comments for public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7796.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first hand that I saw, well, Danielle is going to manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails and letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7804.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do know that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7805.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roberta Cameron was the very first person to put her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=7809.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll let Danielle take it from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10207.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cal, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10209.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, can you unmute Cal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10384.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually was going to just refer to the actual application as read last as was noted last previous meeting on where the findings were and what is being done for environmental site assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10397.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this time, if you can also just I'm going to refrain from the parking and anything else that does not deal directly with the amendment and outside of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10408.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The actual zoning itself, but if you can just tell us a little bit more at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10417.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to reiterate what has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10421.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As far as environmental, not so much mediation as of yet, but what has been done as far as environmental impacts on the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10434.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Assuming that it's not in the actual that no one has can grab it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10953.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10955.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm actually going to, at this time, if there's no other comments that need to be read or there's no other hands up, I'm going to close the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10963.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this time I will defer back to the city and just, if the city can highlight for us in a high level vote point and give us some information, give the board and the public some information about how these goals align with the city's goals, how this project aligns with the city's goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=10982.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or I can actually, Danielle, did you want me to read those out or did you wanna touch base on them to give the public a better idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11191.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11192.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that I wanted to flesh out without going into full detail is the 40B statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11197.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that the public is fully aware of what 40B and how it affects SHI, which is the state subsidized housing inventory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11205.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a certain percentage that every community within the state of Massachusetts has to hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11210.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there's not a low to moderate income housing that's met within a community, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11218.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that community is subjected to a 40B, which is MGL chapter 40B, which is a comprehensive permit law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11224.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what Danielle was referring to, where a developer can come in and take your prime space and it doesn't have to follow regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11233.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is a better way of controlling your housing when you have a housing production goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11239.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the city can actually speak more on that, but I did want to flesh out some of the acronyms that we were using to discuss the housing goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11248.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from the board at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11280.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree, Vice Chair Hedeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11282.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I said, it's not that we were neglecting your comments, but they're more specific to the site itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11289.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is, we're trying to get the zoning done so that we can get the project to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11293.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the project moves forward, once the zoning is approved, then we can do our due diligence and making sure that it conforms to all city ordinances within.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11303.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in saying that, if there's no other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11306.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: questions from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11307.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I feel very confident that Attorney Silverstein as well as M. H. A. And the city staff has already done their, uh, their iterative processes of going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11318.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will ask for a motion to recommend, uh, the motion to recommend to City Council of the approval of the draft PDV three walk on court plan development district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11331.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11332.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11393.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, I guess, recused in the same as abstention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L5KoM4khxVw&t=11398.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have, what, five to... It's five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=406.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any members of the board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=410.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that were not participating previously that would have questions for the proponent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=422.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at this point, if you were absent on the first hearing, you are now able to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=577.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, I think if you can give us a high-level overview of what the actual amendments are, since there's no changes from, but at the same time, because one of our board members was not present, I'm guessing he may want to see a little bit more of the proposal that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=597.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so that he can, at that point, know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=606.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do you just want to do a high level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=638.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then in that case, Attorney Wiseman, because it's being immediately referred back from the city council and to me, um, standing alone and saying this, I think it's just more of an administrative process of it coming back to the board to be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=650.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could just give us the high level, um, details, I think that would suffice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1434.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we move to approve the minutes, I do have one quick thing and that's just the consistency of, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1442.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess my title within some places it says chair, some places it says vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1447.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But other than that, I don't see a problem with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1453.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And these are the minutes from August 2nd, 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1483.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1484.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's, and that's literally what I was, um, I didn't know if anyone else had any changes or anything like that, but if, if no further changes or concerns, uh, I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1497.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A motion to approve the minutes from August 2nd, 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1500.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1506.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1508.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1511.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1520.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1522.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sharad Bharacharya?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1527.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1530.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our next item would be, sorry, it's just miscellaneous items if the city has anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1540.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or any other updates or anything for us at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1553.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was one that I wanted to just call myself, if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1557.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's just recognizing the Roberts Rules of Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1562.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's that all of us have anyone can put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1568.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have the ability to discuss within a meeting, obviously, and present a motion, but they must be recognized through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1574.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So going forward, I just want to make sure that as we proceed with these meetings, that any discussions or motions put on a table are actually through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1583.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just stating that for public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1593.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there's anything else from the city or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1599.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our next meeting is October 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1602.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's correct, Daniel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1644.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if the board can vote on that, but I am highly interested in that debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1652.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That night, and I know that it's recorded, but I've been anticipating it for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1657.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1659.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know that others would participate that night if we would have full participation of items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1686.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely be available for me and don't get me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1689.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just I was going back to if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1693.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whoever's presenting materials for the meeting that night, if they're interested in continuing, I'd be OK with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1771.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, because I wanted to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1774.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1775.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I think about it, I don't, I personally, and this is for the board's review, wouldn't want to see all of those items pushed on to the next meeting, and then we're there all night either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1786.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I don't know, whatever you decide, whatever is decided, if you can let us know, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1807.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I do have a question on that since we have a full quorum and that's not so much discussing the item itself, but I'm just, I'm curious as to how the city's rectifying their situation with, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1820.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or if the city is even involved with the tenant versus landlord parking issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1827.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1828.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that going to continuously be a thing or are you asking for some proof to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1932.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, they're not agreeing, but there's a possibility that they can agree on something that's still not in compliance with city zone for the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1960.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=1961.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not so much zoning, but for the parking lot itself and how many parking spaces are supposed to be there and so forth, is what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2514.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just smiling, because when it comes to MBTA communities, and I'm sure this is not a conflict, but I always literally I have Chris Clutchman at my disposal, like, can you can you explain this to me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2524.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so now that it's met for it, it's like, I don't have that to explain it to me, because I can't reach out for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2543.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: she's my old boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2546.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She just got she's like moving on up over and what is the executive office of communities and livable cities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2554.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: H?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2555.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The old DHT?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2556.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2558.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, she's now she took over for her former boss, which I don't really know what that title is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2563.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But she's like heading up that department now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2565.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So which is cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2567.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyways, alright, so I don't want to drone on about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2571.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2578.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2629.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, as a board, we will review it for the highest and best use for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2634.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure we will, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2635.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2636.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll see what's what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2639.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what we're here for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2654.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I wasn't trying to shut it down myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2656.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2659.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Me as it wasn't board member, I wouldn't want to not have the meet and just because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2664.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can, I can always view the debate later, which would be a bummer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2669.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2671.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: especially if there's pressing items on the agenda or so many items that they would spill over to the following meeting and we would be there all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2702.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Walkland Court, that will be their third time coming before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2707.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2729.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, that's a, well, I know that's not at your level, but I was talking to Danielle about that the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2734.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's one of those, I just, I don't get the second meat and it just feels like it should be, it's an administrative process that feels like it should just be handled with the city solicitor or the city clerk and not coming back to city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2746.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But who am I to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2858.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a public hearing, but I'm still, and this is not to hash out here, I'm just so confused on the legal process of it coming before us for the initial recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2870.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They refer it back to city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2871.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because city council can't do it for, like, whatever, a certain amount of days, it comes back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2878.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I feel like that is where it can be clinked up at or coordinated, but I could be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2886.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe I'll read Lynn's handbook to try to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2890.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not a lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2891.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just sounds like there's something disconnected in the process that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2897.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: wouldn't matter legally as long as we're following the proper administrative process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2901.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I don't, I'm not strong in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2904.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm still trying to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2934.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2935.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So since we are the ones, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2936.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2937.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2961.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2963.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2963.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I won't belabor that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2965.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, thank you so much for letting us know about things to come going forward and not to hold us up anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6eVZD_7YLY&t=2973.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if there's any other updates that anyone wants to provide, but I will ask for a motion for adjournment, if not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=97.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, can you please introduce any city staff on the call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=123.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=125.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first item on our agenda tonight is a special permit for the drive-thru use at 3850 Misty Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=132.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which is Bank of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=133.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been, it's been continued from August 16th, uh, 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=139.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to give an overview, the applicant is applying for a special permit for a drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is in the Wiggins Plaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=147.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The special permit grant in authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the seating board for the board's recommendations on the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=154.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is advised to present to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=157.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: An overall summary actually is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Linden Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=170.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The proposed project will construct an approximately 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-thru lane and one drive-thru bypass lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=181.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, can you introduce all members in representation of Bank of America?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=187.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=541.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Lucas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=542.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=545.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before I get into questions and open up the questions, I want to see if the city wanted to address, I know that there was some comments from the department heads that you had referenced, and I didn't know if there were anyone from the fire department or from the DPW engineering for the city that would be on, or if the PDS staff is willing to give us a background on some of the concerns that were highlighted before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=579.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle or Alicia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=636.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for me, anyways, there were some significant changes to the actual proposal, but at the same time, there were substantive concerns and comments from the fire chief, as well as DPW engineering and PDS staff that I think for my own standing on the board, I would need to further hash out before I could even provide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=663.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a recommendation to move forward, or even a ruling at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=668.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know how the city would want me to handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=671.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know how the other board members feel about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=674.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, without, in the absence of knowing if things have been satisfied with the department heads, I wouldn't know how to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=685.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not even with conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1019.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do have that, but I don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1022.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1065.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't mind, I'm going to open it up to the board if there's any clarifying questions from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1071.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's not just my voice on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1078.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do any board members have any clarifying questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1083.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Concerns or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1223.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yes, please go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1225.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Miss Benefield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1313.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for adding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1315.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was 1 of the questions that I was actually going to raise to the PDF staff is because within the response to the PDFs, there was questions about parking and I saw there the response from the model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1331.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: landlord stating that it must meet the parking requirements for various lease on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1337.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only that, lease restrictions and parking changes will have to be the approval of all tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1342.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was kind of trying to figure out how that was addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1347.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Danielle, if you can please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1351.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see you have your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1506.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The clerk can call the vote, which is Peter, but I can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1516.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I would still, I believe you'd have to do the whole call attendance because you probably don't have that readily available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1523.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have that in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1525.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=1528.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3237.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Attorney Kilson, for your detailed coverage of the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3244.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3249.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My, the one question I have before I open it up to the board is I do have the final amendment myself, but I'm not sure if it was, I'm not sure how, what the actual differences was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3261.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess this is my question to attorney Silverstein, that everything that was addressed within the questions that you originally had in previous drafts, if they were rectified and made whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3277.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for us in the final part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3453.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3455.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3456.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to remind the board and the public before we move forward, again, that as Attorney Silverstein has already noticed, we were given a high-level conceptual presentation by Medford Housing Authority and their team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3472.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although we're focusing only on zoning, like the uses and the dimensions for this first meeting, although the vision informs the zoning, we're going to save all the rest for the site plan review at a later date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3485.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because it's dimensional and zoning and all bound in law, for my purposes, I do not have any more questions that attorney Silverstein has not already answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3499.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this time, I'm going to open it up to the board for any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3530.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3578.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry to interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3581.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, that was definitely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3582.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3585.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any further comments from the board or questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3597.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any questions or comments from the city staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3612.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to open it up for hearing none from the board or from the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=3618.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to open it up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4012.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the most efficient way is in case an actual member of the public has to jump the meeting before we get to the end, maybe we can address individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4022.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And especially in case the same question comes up again, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4033.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4034.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I think you should probably I think we should probably address them individually in case the person that the member of the public that asked the question has to jump before the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4243.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4245.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I'm going to come back to this and I just realized to make sure that we are staying on task and we're answering and that the proponent feels comfortable answering the questions that's related to zoning and the questions that you actually feel are relevant to the case, not that all of the public comments are not relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4262.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, how about we do take a tally of the questions as we go through and then decide which ones are relevant to tonight's public hearing and have the proponent answer the ones that they're able to at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4275.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to keep it more efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4413.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for clarification, not that we're answering this question now, I just want the city to take note in response to environmental metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4422.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This site is not an environmental justice site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4425.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=4455.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mm-hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6432.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, I'm going to ask if the board has any other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6438.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to actually first before the board, I'll close the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6445.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then ask the board if there's any other questions that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6463.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6464.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We originally said that we were gonna answer them case by case, but Amanda has helped me to collect them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6469.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Amanda, have you collected the ones that were relevant to tonight's public hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6763.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6763.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Moran, for clarification, when you said it would trigger something higher, can you be more specific for the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6768.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Were you speaking about the MEPA office or anything dealing with the EEA in Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6774.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted the public to understand how detailed of an environmental assessment you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6779.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: done and what that entails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6847.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6848.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate that question, that clarification, especially where I wanted the public going back to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6853.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane McKinney's reference to environmental justice area that MEPA actually has dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6860.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They have dedicated resources for projects that are near environmental justice populations, which I have clarified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6869.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In my error earlier, not realizing that this area was an environmental justice area, it's Block Group 1, Census Tract 3394, as you stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6878.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's one of the criterias that the state uses for being environmental justice is that it's hugely minority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=6884.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to put that on the record for the public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7753.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, I will open it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7757.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will close the public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7759.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will open it up for board members, and now I see Ari's hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=7992.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Morissette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8012.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8143.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because tonight's discussion is limited to many questions about language, et cetera, I'm going to just trust that attorney's own team with his extensive background in land use litigation and so forth in getting this amendment out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8167.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to get you started, I'm going to ask the board for a motion to recommend the drafted PDD rezoning ordinance for one and in three to 20 walk-in court to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=8249.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will read the public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10316.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Attorney Desmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10318.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10320.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The right of way, if I'm not mistaken, on the presentation said it was 10 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10325.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, if you're going to reduce it to one way, the requirements for the city is 12 feet for one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10370.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have a few other questions in regards to day use and what your relief was, but I think probably this is where I'll just leave it for the comments from city staff, especially, specifically Danielle Evans, if she can speak more directly on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10386.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She'll probably be able to clarify for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10868.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My biggest question was on vehicle conflict, and I think it's pretty much been hashed out, but I'm still not sure that the city is satisfied with the response as far as.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=10884.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as it's been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11435.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from the city staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11445.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How about clarifying questions from the board?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11511.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Danielle, did you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11694.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to, Amanda, are you capturing the conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11701.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering how these conditions will align with the traffic comments that have already been submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11709.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we looking to add or just focusing on a few of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11717.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's more of a question for the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11727.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Dr. Hunt, is that your way of actually mitigating for the vehicle conflict and you'll be okay with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11829.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, my only clarifying question moving forward is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11834.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I think the site plan, I would myself recommend the site plan for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11841.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For approval, considering everything has been adhered to as part of the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11849.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Comment and anything that the city staff has added this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11860.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's no additional questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11867.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you agree, then I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11871.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: elicit a motion that says such, but with Amanda reading out the additional conditions for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=11953.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think they're already being addressed, but just to cover it, I wanted to just condition that I didn't want to let it go without making note to the comments and without the actual representative, the department heads here themselves, just to make sure that they're touching base and compliant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12351.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a heavy TOD area, correct, as presented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12367.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, my, I know it's not a thing much with the advent of Uber and other personal, and other taxi services, but like, I know when, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12380.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tenants say that they're not going to have parking, then they'll get like a rental or a zip car or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12384.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then you still create an on-street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12387.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm good with keeping 18 in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12411.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so going back to that, will there be a sign parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12532.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is only relevant if there was an incentive to not have parking as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12564.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, so to recap, we are striking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12653.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we even have to, do we have to explicitly name out the comments that were taken out, striking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12843.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Even though you weren't here for the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12872.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hey, there's miscellaneous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12874.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have another update before we go to miscellaneous another update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12878.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very happy birthday to Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=12917.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did the city have any other updates or miscellaneous that you wanted to give us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13094.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have a quick one and I promise this is really quick and it helps us with the organization of the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13100.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted the board to, for us to start thinking about rules and regulations for how we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13106.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on how the board actually operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13108.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And something I spoke to Danielle about is, like, I don't know if there's a way that we can legally impose, like, deadlines for proponents to send things in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13117.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If they send it in on a Friday after certain hours and then the city doesn't have a chance to get to it or it gets to us later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13123.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just something legally that we're able to do to help us with, to help the city with their lift and then to help us to have a little bit more time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13157.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I don't know the legalities behind if we can even talk about it because it's not really an item on agenda, but it's an item for ourselves as administrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13165.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we can talk about it in email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13167.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13169.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, because it's going to be part of the board's actions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13173.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13175.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, just not for tonight, but just to put it in your head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13178.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What can we do to help ourselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13240.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13243.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Even the close of Business Friday, is that pushing it for you guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13329.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13339.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I was about to ask for a motion to close, so you go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13344.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13347.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A motion to close the meeting for tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8msxsKW1z_4&t=13355.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking, I can't actually give the motion, so I need one motion and then a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=768.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But before we deliberate with the board, I'm going to actually open it up to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=774.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=778.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to well, actually, I will ask the city staff if there's any questions there, if there's any comments from the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=875.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as far as.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=877.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You had mentioned that you were going to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=881.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Native plants, such as shrubs, can you go into detail a little bit more outside of the new shade trees that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=889.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that you planned on adding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=890.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't I didn't catch anything outside of shrubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=925.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, prior to the final selection, you would need to coordinate it with the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=932.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, Danielle, did you want to highlight anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=969.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=971.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then there was parking demand to reduce the cruising for parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=976.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you able to mandate that the employees park in the rear as suggested previously?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=995.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so they're popular, you'll still leave it open of like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=999.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wayfinding signs for the actual customers to realize that there's parking back there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1030.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, thank you very much for answering that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1033.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a question whether or not that there was an existing connection to the state's MWRA connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1042.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you anticipate there being any problem with that process if it's not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1055.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1056.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1059.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions from city staff or from the board at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1064.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll open it up to the board if none from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1333.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually have a final question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1335.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't sure if there was going to be a food court of some sort that was proposed inside of the store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1355.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So can you just reiterate your trash and litter mitigation for the site, especially for this having a food court?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1405.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for answering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1503.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there are no other comments from the board, I will now open it up to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1507.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I skipped ahead a little bit earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1510.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll open up the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1513.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: by stating that those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1545.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1600.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1602.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to close the public comment period and we're going to go back to board deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1608.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1610.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is where we decide whether or not we are going to approve, deny, or approve with conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1618.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to test the board and just see where you wanted to start off with any conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1626.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can name a few that I know that we will need to go over, but does anyone have anything to add or any questions that they want to cover at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1635.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So any clarifying questions that they want from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1649.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, let's let's discuss some conditions and see if we can actually get this going so that we can possibly get to an approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1657.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If that's okay with the board to see if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1661.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: pretty much deliberate on that for one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1663.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, there was some new, uh, in addition to the shade trees that the proponent has showed us, there was a discussion of some native plantings to make sure that, um, the parking lot would be, um, that the heat island effect would be reduced off the parking lot, um, within previous materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1681.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the proponent has already said that they will be working with, um, city staff, uh, to determine final selection of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1688.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be a condition I would impose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1700.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1701.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1704.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Usually Amanda acting in the realm of clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1708.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As of right now, Amanda, I just want to clarify that you are going along with our are you recording our conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1741.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes and so to clarify on my end, I'm reading what the PDS staff has provided us with and I want to see how the board feels about these conditions and if you want to adopt them to go forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1754.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the first one would be in addition to the new shade trees, we're talking about native planning such as the flowering shrubs that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1766.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Weatherby has already discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1770.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the board is OK with that approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1772.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but with that conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1824.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll just go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1827.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as discussed, in order to meet customer parking demand and reduce cruising for the parking behavior, which creates congestion and reduces pedestrian safety, employees and staff will be required to park in the rear parking lot, as well as wayfinding signs be provided to make customers aware of the availability of the rear parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1873.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, of course, the proposal will comply with the requirements of the fire chief's memo dated 6 to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1879.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: During the original 6 to 2023 from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1887.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and we also confirmed that the drive aisles all meet the requirements too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1893.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in accordance with the city engineering comments and their memo dated 6-2-2023, the heaved and cracked panels of the sidewalk along Meadow Avenue must be replaced in conformance with city standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1928.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is for public purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1934.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll read out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1935.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In accordance with the city engineering comments in their memo dated 6-2-2023, driveway apron must be reconstructed to ensure conformance with MAAB regulations, particularly in regard to cross slopes, widths, and accessible paths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1947.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The accessible walkway, which is a sidewalk, should cross the apron via Portland cement concrete panels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1958.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the final one that we had was just to ensure that trash and litigation for the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1965.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Especially with there being a full court, and you said you would work with the board of health on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2008.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you'll just work with the board of health on appropriate trash and mitigation for those items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2016.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the support have any other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2019.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For 1, do we accept all these conditions as is, or does the board have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2025.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or subtract if none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2056.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and that would be part of one of the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2061.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or actually two, so that's all encompassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2065.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the site I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2067.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, a roll call for acceptance of the site plan site plan approval with conditions as stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2115.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I actually said that at the beginning, and I'm so used to doing roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2118.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2118.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2128.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we are going to go back and start over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2190.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so the next item on the list tonight is special permit for 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is Bank of America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2202.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was continued from 7-19-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2204.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The applicant is in the processes of revising the plan documents for the board's review and has requested a continuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2211.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to entertain a motion to continue this item to the next board meeting, which is a date certain on 9-6-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2220.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A 2nd 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2224.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call vice chair and we had a man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2226.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I Peter cows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2230.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I. Are you fishermen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2233.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I. Pam Mary asking I. Sally, a key key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2239.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I sure I watched her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2244.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie mcpherson's I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2247.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's been moved to 9623.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2249.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And our next item on the list is petition referred from city council for zoning ordinance amendments, which has continued from 8 to 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2256.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to invite Danielle Evans, which is senior planner for the city to present any changes to the amendment to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2657.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this the one related to keeping certain uses off of places like Mystic Avenue, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2679.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to me, just quickly, it does make sense that the planning board, as Daniel has already outlined, and yourself has already outlined, Lucia, that we see things more holistically with the city's vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2692.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess it comes to one of those things where I feel like it should be an elected board that is special from a granting agency, but I mean, authority, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2707.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're saying that you want, I can definitely see what you mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2712.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I had some hesitations before because it almost looked like we were trying to keep certain uses out on purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2719.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if it's because you want it to be looked at more holistically, I just wanted to clarify that with the board that it just, as you said, it makes sense that we're actually looking at it at the city's vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2845.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And who's obligated to get the city's highest and best use for a site, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2892.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=2894.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3662.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Daniel, I don't want to cut you off, but if you had referred to 3 a, and I don't know if you wanted to just just for public purposes at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3674.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sort of explain that 3 is related to the multi house and actor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3678.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's only that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3740.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Having inclusionary housing previously by special meant, which is didn't pretty much make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3745.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is meant should be mandatory for the that's just that would be in conflict with the rule, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=3751.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4720.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm still getting into E-H-O-L-C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4749.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mike a clarifying question for number 5 are so the board's not able to vote on that one side because you still have to parse it out with the legal counsel to make sure that it's being presented properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4760.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Even if you take out some of the information that you have there, it needs to be reviewed by legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4928.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My only question, and that's for the board for deliberation, is that we understand that this is an interim step to hold over to zone revisions, and you want to get these administrative changes done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4941.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to me as one board member, I can definitely vote on the other ones, but number five, I thought that there was like a process legally that before we change anything, we just had to make sure we were okay with what we're changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4952.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know that I've wrapped my full head around exactly what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=4958.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know if the board has, but I would also be inclined to say that I could recommend approval once you figure it out, once the city staff figured it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5103.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll open it up to the board now for clarifying questions and just to see exactly the temperature of where we're going with this and to see if there's any other questions that the board may have of Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5114.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Daniel, if you're finished with your presentation, that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5379.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's no more questions from the board, because this is still a public hearing, I'm going to open it up for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5386.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that there's public on, but I will read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5389.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hands feature or message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5393.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5432.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to close the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5437.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and go back to board deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5440.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will just start by just, I will leave the floor open for the board members to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5450.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at this point, I appreciate the city's, all of the work that Daniel and other city staff has done in trying to identify these potential misaligned uses slash rules and rectify for ease for the city and ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5464.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5466.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before I ask for a motion, I will ask if there is anything that the board wants to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5497.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to ask for potential motion to recommend approval of the proposed proposed ordinance amendments to the city council with the condition of Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5507.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you help me capture that language for a number 5?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5510.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5593.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any objections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5595.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have one clarifying question on the marijuana and signed definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5598.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe I didn't capture that one in my conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5600.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What was that one that we discussed for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5861.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to try this again potential motion to recommend approval of the zoning ordinance amendments to City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5875.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to read the motions just for public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5880.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition to the definitions with the following conditions, in addition to the definitions included in the paper, to also include the marijuana and signed definitions from the former zoning ordinances in section 12.0, recommend that SBGA for the adjusted C2 uses be the CDB,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=5900.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For item number five, delegate to the PDS to update the language reflecting what was discussed, included in the recommendation to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=150.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property 243 Mystic Avenue as depicted on the plan entitled site layout plan, dated June 15th, 2023,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=161.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: from commercial to C2 zoning district to a planned development district, which is a PDD and have, which would have new development standards for Metro zoning ordinance chapter 94, 9.23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=174.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=179.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, Amanda has already shared that link with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=182.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, do you actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=188.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: do you want to introduce this next, do you want to introduce who's here for this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=427.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Attorney Osmond, for being here with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=430.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the other things that I wanted to note for our board members is that this is the proponent will most likely present a high-level conceptual presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=440.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our task is to focus on zoning, the uses and dimension at this step for the proposed parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=447.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not yet at the site review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=449.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, um, as far as the vision and visuals and things like that, so we're, the onus is zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=454.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I just wanted to, um, iterate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1499.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: your detailed of the uses and you're going back and forth with, you know, just giving us, filling us the new board members in from previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1517.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before I open it up, Amanda, I'm not sure if we should have Attorney Orzman step in here and pretty much set the stage before we get to the public comment, or should we go straight to the public comment first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1602.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1603.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's where we're trying to get to, um, um, without the public and the board having a reference to those iterations, uh, that you and the proponent have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1613.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I'm just not, I'm not sure at this point, um, if how to guide the, the meeting going forward, I want to make sure that we're doing right by the city as well as a proponent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1625.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so I guess at this time I will request, um, if there are any comments from the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1823.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1823.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's pretty much where I know it's a public hearing, but that's what I was trying to guide to stay at a conversation for the public and what we were opening it up for prior to opening it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1832.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for referencing that, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1837.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at this time, I will, I'll ask for clarifying questions to solicit from the board first before opening it up from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=1848.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anyone from the board have any clarifying questions before we open it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2154.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Attorney Osmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2156.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my actual questions is the intricacies of the multi-uses and all the different special permits that are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2164.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wasn't exactly sure, again, especially how you detailed the uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2170.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the applicant has already tried to explain them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2173.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's just, in layman's terms, it's kind of hard to capture here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2176.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is going to be played out later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2178.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, what the board is trying to do is just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2183.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to recommend it to the city council to continue this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2186.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2187.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that it can be vetted out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2190.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2279.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2279.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize if I've taken up the time from other board members that have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2291.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hearing none, I'm going to open up the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2294.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2299.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2304.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2309.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2360.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2362.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I will close the public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2366.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2367.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: bring it back to board deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2402.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, well, at this point, um, hearing, uh, no further, um, responses from the board, I will ask for a motion to recommend the, um, the language as is, uh, going to the city council as opposed to continue it or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2417.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause that's, uh, attorney Orzman has said, this has had many iterations with the city, with, uh, the applicants attorney, as well as, um, attorney Orzman as the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2428.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we'll let it go to its next step with the city council and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2432.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will ask for a motion to recommend to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=2780.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Members should feel free to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3243.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any comments from the city staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3306.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3307.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the clarifying questions that I actually have Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3310.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure if you're or turning Silverstein is in the board's position on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3323.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: further department review or, um, or comments from the attorney or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3329.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure what it is outside of, if you've said this has been in, um, you know, an iterative process where, um, the board has come to agreement with the attorneys as well as the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3342.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3343.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What would the board be pulling out of this at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3346.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there was any kind of, um, any kind of concerns, because again, this is not site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3352.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3354.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What will we if is it out of whack with the zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3359.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is it that we're looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3545.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Daniel, for explaining that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3547.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it just brings me back to the kind of things that I want to kind of look at here are not part of zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3556.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's why I have to keep asking clarifying questions to make sure that I'm keeping myself on tap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3562.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at this point, it's like, it looks like it's well prepared with legal as well as with the city is to move forward recommended, but I'm just one board member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3572.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so at this point, it's like, it's just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3576.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the things that I want to talk about are not, they're not, we're not there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3581.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the right items going before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3587.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And saying that, I will ask if there's any other clarifying questions from the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=3860.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4045.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So yes and no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4047.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this stage, we're doing the actual zoning and that's what we're focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4052.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But should this get recommended and moved on, then the community development board has the onus of making sure that the site, we would review that at the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4093.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Attorney Silverstein, are you able to help us out with the language here as far as how 17 on the dimensional standards and requirements would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4106.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: play out later?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4129.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, you're absolutely within rights and you have every right to have this question clarified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4134.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what I was trying to get the attorney available to us to do is to better explain what it meant as captured here versus what we would be doing in the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4150.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4194.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4216.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4261.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4262.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to close the public comment period at this time and ask the board for any final clarification questions prior to deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4278.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the board want to delve into anything else regarding adjustments to the proposed use table, dimensional table outside of what has already been raised with parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4300.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: hearing no further comments or questions from the board, and based on the information that I have from the city as well as from both attorneys, I'm going to ask for a potential motion to recommend approval of the drafted PDD rezoning ordinance for 100 Winchester Street PDD to city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4322.111s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anyone want to give a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4331.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4364.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so the next item on the agenda is a petition from PDS the city council proposing zoning ordinance amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4381.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: public hearing announcement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4393.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought I did hear two people second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4396.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard, I think I heard two people at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4400.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4403.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Sally made the motion and I believe Ari seconded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4428.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The method community development board shall conduct a public hearing on August 2 2023 after 630pm via zoom relative to a petition by city council, Vice President Isaac B.

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4490.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=4491.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A link to the public hearing is to be posted on the city's website and it was posted related in July 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5058.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, just kind of, and which one is that Danielle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5063.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry that you're looking at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5226.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Alicia, and for the newer board members, I remember you laid this out for us in a meeting on June 7 and pretty much one of the uses and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5235.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: being a special permit granting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5237.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that the city feels as though it's probably easier for it to go to the community development board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5244.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know the position of the rest of the board at this point, but if we can just, I guess for my own purposes, I was able to talk to Danielle and Amanda earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5257.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can just give a little bit more context<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5261.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of why you probably want to keep it with community development board as a special permit granting agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5462.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for reading that I do know that there was a clarifying question that was asked because the way it was presented originally just for myself anyways and it sounds like maybe another board member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5471.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the question was that it sounded like someone was trying to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5474.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the way that you explained that, it's not that it was like, it sounded more like a political kind of thing where it's like, now you have these appointed members that are, um, are sort of, um, responsible for these, uh, permits case by case basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5490.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's not what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5491.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What you're saying is that you want to make it that's well-formed so that we're able to get the highest and best uses for the space on Mystic Ave as opposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5500.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: just having like a lot of parking lots and in automobiles and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5505.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want I just wanted to clarify that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5610.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, so this is like an interim step to hold over to the zoning revisions that you also mentioned it was the city was going to hire a consultant to do a redraft so that we can be better guided going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5625.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, and you said there was going to be maybe a chunk of these administrative kind of changes coming through and we should probably move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5632.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: fast as possible, but what is the best way for them to be presented as Danielle's doing tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5638.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're not voting on them, are we just going over them and then we'll, I mean, I guess I should let Danielle finish talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5790.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sorry I asked a lot of questions based on prior knowledge I don't know, Daniel if you were finished with your presentation or if you wanted to open it up to the board to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5980.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you want us to do this as an exercise along with you or separate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=5985.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to figure out the best way to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6406.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we respect to the timing of this as Alicia has already pointed out and making sure that it's not convoluted to get it pushed through city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6416.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Assuming that all board members, including myself would have to be read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6422.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would have to like just read the comprehensive plan again for the use table just to see what the vision is and what we want to put there for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6430.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you're well versed in what's what the city has for a vision Danielle so if you can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6438.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: maybe point out some high level things you mentioned earlier, something about a convenience store, it's a shame that they have to have a special permit, but something else didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6446.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you can give us some high level things that we can actually deliberate on, and not so much telling us exactly what we should be changing, but just give us a little bit more to like, just zoom in for the sake of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6659.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6660.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6661.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it is a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6663.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanna make sure that we got all of the board's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6668.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still do have, I believe a couple of questions, but I guess I'll table them for when you said you're gonna sort of clean this up and, cause we can't really vote on it tonight, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6729.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it definitely does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6732.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I actually like that we have the lawyer's comments that can set us straight here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6737.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it keeps us straight, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6743.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And had I known that you wanted us to do that exercise, I could have looked at the use, we could have all looked at the use table to get it done a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6773.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My interest is how to sort of see what the board is feeling about being the special grant authority for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6785.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as presented for these changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6790.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that we don't have all members in attendance, but I guess that's one of my main questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6817.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's definitely this is a public hearing now, just, uh, reiterate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6871.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6872.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually, um, I have no objections overall, but at the same time, I would definitely like to have a full board, um, and to be able to weigh in on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6882.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, but at the same time, I do know that they have the option to view, um, the recordings, but in order to provide, um, feedback to the planning staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6899.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6936.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Definitely it's uh, thank you so much for reminding me of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6939.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So based on the mullins statute, um any board member that's absent still gets its voting authority, but um, but at the same time they must attest to the fact that They have watched all statutory, um recordings or proceedings in order to participate so the absent members still get to participate but um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=6962.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess, who would, would the city actually give them that option to participate with tonight, or would they just know to do that, Amanda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7020.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have we, we've definitely confirmed that based on the Mullen statute, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7024.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because there was some nuances around the word absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7026.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says when a member is absent, they can still catch up and, you know, attest to the fact that they've read the statutorial proceedings, but absent meaning they would have had to have been an established board member at the time of, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7042.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7043.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7047.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It couldn't be read wrong, but even another Metro resident, my husband, he read it and said, no, no, no, that's not how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7055.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyways, I was just trying to make sure that we got clarity on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7062.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, but because it is, we can continue to deliberate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7066.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does any board members have any other questions before I open it up to the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7076.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to open public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7080.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7083.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If anyone's on or looking, message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7088.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that anyone's on for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7090.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But Amanda, if you can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7101.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in saying that, again, I don't believe we have any members of the public on, but Amanda, if you can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7107.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, see if there's any emails or letters that were sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7112.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Regarding this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7135.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7136.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So procedurally, I will close the public comment period and board will go back to deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7141.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is, uh, uh, another chance for us to discuss, um, the proposal, which, um, or hash out any questions since it's not really anything to vote on at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7152.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, if there's any adjustments or any concerns that the board may have, um, the proposed use of the use table or anything that you see that has been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7163.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, again, my, my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7166.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my only, cause I, I'm not, I'm a minimal to many things, but one of my questions is, um, have any other board members weigh in, but I guess they have to do their due diligence and catching up with tonight's public meeting to be able to participate in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7202.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay so this has to get out and because it's a public meeting it has to um I am going to say we should probably obviously continue this and it has to be a date certain correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7215.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7215.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So August 16th will be the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7218.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I can have a motion to continue this topic actually not this topic but the petition from PDS and City Hall proposing zoning ordinance amendments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7232.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to August 16th, 2023 Community Development Meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7264.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7265.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought I changed it and I did it backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7268.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7270.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No worries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7271.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My most sincere apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7274.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7277.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7278.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Marionski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7281.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7283.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7284.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7286.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7289.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we will continue with our next item, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7293.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Board elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7296.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, in the absence of two members, I'm not sure that we are prepared for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7300.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, Amanda, if you've received any interest for the clerk or the community preservation committee representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7307.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know that Ari, you are concurrently holding over in CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7314.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know if we were restructuring or looking at that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7329.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, hold the post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7333.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an empty clerk seat as it stands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7338.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7339.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7343.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so next item, approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7348.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if I can actually have a motion to approve the minutes from 6-7-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7354.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, this is a question I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7356.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure, Pam and Sally, if you were in attendance or if you were even part of the board on 6-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7363.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, are they able to vote on the minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7399.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're like, you're just you have them in your which they're voted into record, which is weird, because you can't vote statutorily on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7408.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: something that you can watch and pretty much be a part of by watching it, but you can vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7414.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7435.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7454.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, that was the question that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7456.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not so much there, again, the nuance of the word absence, not so much that they were absent from the meeting, but that they were not even<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7465.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a part of the board at the time of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7468.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's for public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7471.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I mean, I was just meaning, can they still vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7519.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, if you're absolutely sure that we can, we don't have to hold it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7522.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm okay with vote, and I just thought maybe it's after we accepted it, and maybe Emily and Peter came back and said, oh, wait, that's not what it said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7531.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we rectify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7533.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we go back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7536.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could amend them, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7538.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, you could amend them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7539.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7539.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, then if there's a way forward, then I don't see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7543.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what these are June minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7587.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this time, I'll ask for a motion to accept the minute means from 6-7-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7592.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I so move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7598.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7600.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7601.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll call Ari Fishman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7606.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7607.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Marianski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7609.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7610.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7613.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7618.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So miscellaneous and other updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7619.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the city have anything, Amanda or Daniel, do you have anything that you want to announce at this time or share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7718.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank all of you for being patient with me on these PDDs because they're pretty much new to the city, and I can't get my head wrapped around the fact that we're still in the zone amendment, especially with all the legalese that's going behind it and with the absence of like a city solicitor that you can just reach out and be like, okay, what's going on and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7737.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you guys have done an amazing job at the city staff on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7743.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: just getting it to where it's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7745.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's like, I'm just, I'm at that point myself as one board member, I'm ready to dive into the site plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7752.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is, it's a little difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7753.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's even more difficult to like lead the board and what we're supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7757.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7760.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate all of your help on that again, because I felt like a fish out of water really with the PDDs again, being new at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7773.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I know I will work with all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7776.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7779.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one other thing I wanted to ask, I wanted to make sure that I'm pronouncing names properly outside of getting Irie's last name proper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7789.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Marianski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7791.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I saying it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7797.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maryanski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7798.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maryanski?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7799.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7799.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's how I say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7801.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then Sally, am I saying it proper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7804.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7805.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7806.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7806.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7807.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just I don't know the last meeting I kept saying to myself like I should have asked but and so I asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7815.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't have anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7819.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7822.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't tell my husband that, even though he's close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7824.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still answer to Furtado.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7826.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's who I've been for nearly 50 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7828.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I forget that I'm embarrassing myself at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7839.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aCJcADLEqaY&t=7844.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so if there's nothing else, does someone want to make a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2208.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, before we do board elections, Amanda, would it be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2212.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should we vote on the meeting minutes from 517 1st?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2214.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I can just get it out of the way the approval of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2222.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, have you rejoined us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2225.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm having technical difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2228.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2228.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2229.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2229.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to see if anyone wants to make a motion to approve the meet and minutes from 5-17-23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2246.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2246.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I do have a clarifying question before we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2249.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, are we...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2254.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2254.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have board members that were not present at the time of will they will their vote carry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2278.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2278.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're gonna do a roll<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2287.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you Fishman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2288.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2289.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pam Mariansky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2290.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2291.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2292.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2293.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Jackie McPherson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2295.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2297.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now to our final topic or close to final topic, board elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2303.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2306.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As we know, our former chair has turned out and he has left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2312.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so now we have to elect a new chair, as well as me sitting in the vice chair position, that position has to be reelected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2322.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we also need a community preservation committee representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2328.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, that's just to start off the conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2332.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have decided to put my head in for the chair position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2336.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and I didn't know if anyone else was also vying to be chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2349.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, thank you so much for the vote of confidence, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2352.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With my technical difficulties and everything over here, I'm like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2358.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess carrying no other names, I'll do a roll call vote for Jackie McPherson for chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2368.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2370.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, yes, that sounds right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2371.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, I just wanted to make sure before I pompously move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2377.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Emily Hederman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2380.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Enthusiastic, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2395.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2396.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sally Akiki?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2397.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2399.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And myself, of course, I'm Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2401.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2404.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if anyone, because now there's no vice chair to back me up, or as per our ordinance, would anyone like to put their hat in for the vice chair position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2467.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2468.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2468.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you've captured well, and it's literally a backup to the chair where if David has recused the former chair, Bloomberg had to recuse himself for anything, which is maybe only once or twice that I've known that him being chair, I've had to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2485.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had the opportunity or honor to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2488.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then obviously now with him having turned out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2491.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was able to step in and provide the chair role now, but there was no difference than being a regular board member, but just knowing in the back of your mind that, you know, he would reach out in enough time to give you that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2504.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it wasn't like it was a surprise or anything like that, but just being a backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2558.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that that helps facilitate these meetings, and some of the things, just just for full transparency the city has been awesome and helping to guide conversations not so much to just just given another perspective of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2576.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what we should be looking at, not so much in how we're to determine anything, but so we've been getting a lot of administrative assistance from the city in that respect, which I have definitely appreciated from Danielle with the PDS going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2589.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're never out on a limb, kind of just to give that background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2602.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2613.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily, for stepping up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2615.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we are going to do a roll call for Emily, if there's no other people that want to vie for the position of vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2628.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So roll call, Emily Hedeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2631.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2633.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2633.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2634.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2648.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Emily, and welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2659.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So now we're just going to come back to Amanda and sort of say, okay, so now we have the clerk position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2664.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that I've learned about the clerk position is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2668.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was asking Amanda about taking conditions as we're going through the meeting and things like that, if I'm supposed to write them, if Amanda's supposed to write them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2674.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's something more that the city wants to lean kind of on the clerk for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2679.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just keeping that in mind, not to scare anyone away, but Amanda, you can go into more detail about that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2686.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=2830.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Emily, for articulating exactly what I was trying to articulate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3194.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, so I was kicked out of the meeting for a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3197.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize if I missed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3200.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If anyone, at your presentation, Amanda, of the, what it entails to be a CPA representative, I wasn't sure if anyone wanted to, if anyone had put their hat in, their name in the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3222.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm not even sure if any of you can hear me, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3238.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: part of my technical difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3239.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm working on three different computers now, not just one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3243.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3245.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3247.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3353.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, we're going to table for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3356.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, are you okay staying as CPA rep in the interim or are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3361.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3362.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you'll stay and then we'll revisit clerk and CPA going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3367.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3368.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, do you have any miscellaneous updates or announcements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3663.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was one miscellaneous item that I want to discuss openly, speaking of assistance from the city and that's, and having discussions with Amanda, we were talking about the ability to have site visits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3675.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that sometimes when we get the materials, we have just enough time to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3679.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, just enough time to go over them and not really enough time to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3682.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Amanda has offered a solution that can pretty much help the board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3690.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: implement or make a site visit happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3693.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, do you want to speak on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3865.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3866.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Clarifying question, Alicia, as well as Amanda, following up with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3870.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I had more in mind is like, for instance, I will get for myself, for my own interests, sometimes I will get the material and I'll say, well, I wish I had time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3878.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, you know, I just did my walk on that or I just I was at the grocery store on that side and I wish I had a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3883.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a chance to kind of see this because it'd be like some tiny nuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3887.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's just for my own personal preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3890.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I thought maybe it could be open up to the entire board, not so much as mandatory or even a requirement, but more if you had the time and you wanted to be able to see a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3904.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If they thought that there was a problem, someone that could not be pretty much understood on paper, if we can get enough time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3911.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to decide if we wanted to go out individually and see the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3986.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mine is more so like if it's a PDD and it's coming to a certain area, like we're very new at the PDD process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3993.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me see where this, I wanna see it visually, off paper kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=3999.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's more of what I was talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4001.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not gonna be every single project, but just if the board wanted to see something that they had an interest in seeing on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4009.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all, not everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4010.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think a lot of the things that we can pretty much tackle<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4016.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: virtually, but just if there was like an extra, not to burden the board more, just giving them extra help in trying to figure it out, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4405.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for even entertaining it Amanda, I didn't want to add any extra arduous tasks onto it at the same time, just like with land use, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4412.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You want to make sure that you're using the board's highest and best use of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4416.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just know that there's just been a couple of instances that I wish I had a little bit more time to myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4422.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I was just opening it up for the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4424.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I didn't mean to make that a huge thing, but... No, I think it's a great suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4432.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, thank you for the discussion, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4435.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, if there is nothing else on the agenda, if no one else has anything to add, I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4448.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second it, Pam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pNq06c2r0cA&t=4480.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1237.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1797.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1837.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=1841.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see them twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2112.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alicia, do you know what the paper trigger was for the lie?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2151.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm almost positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2153.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't say that I can't say that I'm positive about knowing but I'm just wondering if it's transportation which we discussed in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2161.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2162.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=2162.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3217.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was on mute, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3220.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I live right across the street behind 61 Locust, and one of the things, as the point has said, it can be underutilized, but then there's times it's like, when it's bursting, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3231.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now that there's the Ford Tavern there, the Ford Tavern, I thought had some kind of a, I'm not sure, the city would know this more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3239.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a partnership with that least parking that's right directly across the street from it and then when they're still over during the holidays from the metal glen mall that parking lot is used and if i'm not mistaken there's also a dog park there that is sometimes brings more cars so i'm just trying to figure out um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3257.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm glad that the commissioner brought up the parking issue because I'm trying to figure out where all of those cars would go, even though it's not pretty much utilized for, I don't know, 70% of the year, 30% is still a lot when you don't have parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3269.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just trying to, in the absence of department head information from the traffic engineer, I guess I'm just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3311.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3372.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you didn't ask me, but thanks to that development that's on close to 61 Locust, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=3380.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That actually came with a previous development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4177.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4184.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4255.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And before we do a motion, we may not have a quorum, but we can just continue it in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4260.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's no quorum and it's just continuous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4262.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I'm concerned with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4263.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause I know we're losing members and I myself will not be here July 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4307.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4309.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second Emily's and Emily you second Peter's for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4314.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4402.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll vote to approve the minutes from 520 523 5323 5323.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4405.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4405.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4406.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a second for Jackie's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4723.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I will tell you offline, I'll pick up the conversation offline but I want to thank you for meeting us, Mr. Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4730.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's for sure, because I know even in preparation within my seat, it's it's a heavy lift and I can only imagine all that you had to do to keep up so I appreciate all done I think I can't speak for the board, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4743.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It gives me angst to know that we're going to lose you in leading that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4749.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I'm sure that, like myself, all of us want to see the city pull forward with these planning projects and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4755.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's kind of hard, the capacity of it, the bandwidth of it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4760.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we are very appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4762.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very appreciative of all you've done to keep us straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4770.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you didn't mention mistakes, I wouldn't know that they existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K9V4Q_QDZAA&t=4791.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll give a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=808.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=810.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As Attorney Dash has mentioned, the nonconformity increased by 2% of the lot coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=817.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That really isn't a thing, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=818.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because it's an academic quad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=820.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just, I want to make sure that we're clear here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=826.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't I don't see any issues and as far as parking, because again it's academic why it does, I don't think that will increase parking is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=887.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=887.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=888.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=888.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one other question that's kind of related, but not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=892.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When is sociology moving to Eaton Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=894.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a Tufts alum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=896.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the only other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=911.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=911.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2039.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: David, this is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2043.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2045.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, it is exciting to have this new means coming in, and I can definitely see a large customer base and maybe market demand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2052.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And speaking of that, one of the things that I noticed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2056.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just for the area over there in Middlesex Ave, is there, one of my first questions is, I wasn't aware that this was a grocery store previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2065.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it was always a fitness center even before crunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2069.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I didn't realize that it was already set up to be a grocery center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2072.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out how emergency vehicles and if trucks are tight and they're loading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2079.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How would emergency vehicles go in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2081.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then my second piece to that is traffic generation trips are going to be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2086.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to know if it was standard uses or if it was actually determined at certain peak hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2092.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then secondly, the pedestrian set up over there is lacking on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2098.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have a couple of questions surrounding safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2103.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it wants to just speak a little bit more on so basically my overall questions are safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2112.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Access for proper access for emergency vehicles and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2119.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: traffic generation, which you say, for instance, this is as we just heard from one of our residents, Miss Kim stated that it would be a demand, even I was shocked, you know, it sounds like it's a great place going to bring all kinds of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2133.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we prepared for this and with the proper traffic generation resource?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2375.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, one of my biggest concerns is that the walkability issue over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2378.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My dentist is actually located right next door to Crunch Fitness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2382.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I walk over there, and so what you bring it in the college, tuck, tuck, and just having other options, not all will use Ubers a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2391.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: will implement the blue bikes that the city is installing around Medford now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2396.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, and I've seen that a lot, even increasing with going to BJ's across the street from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2401.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm just a little concerned about, I literally, if I'm walking over, if I decide to leave my car at home and I'm walking over there, I'm making a run for my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2410.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's like, it's a little bit more than hoping that the cars will drive, you know, safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2414.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not putting it on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2415.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just that it is bringing in more traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2418.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's where my concern comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2616.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just having a hard time envisioning it only because I know just from being in Medford itself and living across from Wegmans with that, that's a larger and it brings a lot of traffic to the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2628.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And with H Mart being specialized, we just don't know the market base and what that traffic would bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2636.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just not convinced that it won't be a huge significant increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2642.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'll leave that to the traffic engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2662.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2662.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And my thoughts are anecdotal from being a neighbor, and from pretty much using all these spaces that we're referencing, and just me being over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2673.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'll just, I'll defer to the experts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=2675.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just as a neighbor myself, or as a resident of Medford, it's just a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3138.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: especially accessing the site from Middlesex Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3141.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's one of my biggest, because again, as Christy has already mentioned, as a board, we're looking to make sure that as you're building, we're making sure that we're getting, we're making sure that there's a community benefit and you being a community neighbor, this is our opportunity to make sure that it's done well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3160.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And not to put the stress or burden or economic burden on you, but at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=3166.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: pedestrian safety should be at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=4204.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to clarify, this is for one change or a few changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5163.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5348.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to speak on a July 5th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5351.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that I will not be in attendance because I won't be in the states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XmUZLMvFw8s&t=5357.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know where that leaves us with quorum or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=85.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2293.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, before you do the roll call this is vice chair McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2297.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I have a clarifying question in order to do that I thought that originally, Attorney Desmond had said that the project had to be complete first are we able to give that condition now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2334.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't adding extra layers for the proponent to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2339.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=2353.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3163.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, David.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3167.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this point, since David has already prepared us for what to be going before us, I will ask the proponent, Mr. Mavini, if you can, if you wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=3180.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: take over and Amanda, if you can please give him the control so that he can share his screen with us and he can do his presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4465.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Mr. I appreciate you going over those very extensively with the full details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4473.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, what I'll stop in and I'll open it up to the city staff to provide any kind of input that they may have at this at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4493.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4495.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4496.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Hunt or Amanda, if you have anything that you want to add to this before we open it up to our board and to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4576.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4577.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4578.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4580.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4581.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4582.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I was, I've actually, I quickly cross-referenced myself as Mr. Vinnie was going through everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4589.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seems we do have obviously a couple of new comments that came in from the city, but it seems as though the city staff, the department heads don't have much more to add either, but we'll get to that part after I open it up to the rest of the board to see if they have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4608.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does any board members want to speak or provide input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4873.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have any other questions or comments from board before we open it up for the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4887.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, hearing none, I am actually going to go ahead and open up to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4893.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4898.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4903.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4907.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Remind all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4911.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4914.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4920.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to share and all the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4924.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, I can't see the entire screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4960.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, Amanda, I'm gonna, so I will close the public comments since you don't have, since we don't have any that are coming in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4969.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things I wanted to just make sure is that before I proceed to the board to get us to deliberate, I want to make sure that we are in compliance with making sure that we're considering the special permit as the grant and authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4981.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've already looked at if there's a special, if you can guide me on if there's a special consideration besides what the department has already entered into, or have already provided to the proponent to be considered, whether it's for traffic or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=4998.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Other than that, then the board would deliberate without, the board would deliberate outside of whatever you suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5073.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for public purposes, do you want me to read those out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5078.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5078.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, actually, it could be good just to... Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5082.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As per 94-11.62 for a special permit criteria, what we are now determining is the consideration of the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5091.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, that social, economic, or community needs which are served by the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5096.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5099.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, adequacy of utilities and other public services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5103.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Four, compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5108.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Five, impacts on the natural environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5111.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And six, the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan, which we have heard from the city's director, Hunt, that it goes well with the community's needs there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5141.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Based on an update from the traffic information from Todd Blake, his overall sentiment in regards to traffic, there's this one tiny mitigation that the proponent can consider and that's just additional blue bikes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5157.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I want to bring attention to the fact that two of our conditions previously from the previous board ruling, number one and two may be outdated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5166.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something to look at going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5185.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And overall, his assessment of the project hasn't changed, then his recommendations have not changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5193.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's in regards to traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5200.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5280.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then in addition, one of the newest is from the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion that was not included previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5289.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you looked at those requirements, those recommendations for ADA compliance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5320.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Without my influence, I want to say that based on what I've seen and what has been prepared here in the length of our conditions previously, if we looked at our conditions, I think it pretty much covers one through six, but I would need, I don't stand alone, and I would need the board to pretty much weigh in on what you think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5347.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is our first one, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5360.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess before we actually vote on it, Amanda, are we, the onus is on us to make sure that we have all these conditions again, because we can't just rely on the previous conditions because a couple of them are outdated, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5374.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would we need to relist those 16 conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5378.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe it was 16 conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5419.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess this is more of a two-part kind of thing, because we're also doing site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5423.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So should we do that separately, or should we review the actual standards for approval for that going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5500.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, determining that we're hitting on every, um, one of the, uh, the listed points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5514.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So basically what I'm asking the board is, do we find that one social economic community needs, which are served by the proposal and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5524.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, do we find that the traffic flow and safety include in parking and loading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5529.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, do we find adequacy of utilities and other public services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5533.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Four, compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5539.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Five, do we find impacts on the natural environment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5542.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And six, do we find the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan before we make recommendations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5551.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is what I am asking the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5582.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5588.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5589.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, the social economic community needs definitely served, obviously, because as Peter has pointed out, before it was just the parking garage that was serving cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5599.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now it's going to be serving people, communities, economic benefit for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5604.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I cannot stand alone on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5608.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading, has been determined by Todd Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5614.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm going on the expert of the department head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5617.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, adequacy of utilities and public utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5620.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am going by, again, the determination of the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5626.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As far as the compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5631.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As far as scale, that's something that we can further discuss if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5636.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had board member Clay's agency has already Asked a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5642.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't have any myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5644.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know if any of the other board members wanted to do a great on that particular point As far as impacts on a natural environment Direct director hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5657.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if you have a specific thing for climate or resiliency there for us to do a rate on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5664.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5719.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we can probably clean up the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5721.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, um, how does the board feel about the existing conditions with eliminate and one and two, um, as being obsolete, um, as per Todd Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5732.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then if we wanted to add any Peter, um, I know I'm, I'm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5752.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: General sense before we do a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5753.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to get the conditions under control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5756.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so that's Amanda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5760.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5760.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so Amanda, that would be striking one and two from the, uh, previous conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5768.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5770.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then adding, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5772.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we feel about adding the blue bike reference from public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5782.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the one thing is in number 15, I guess we would just update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5787.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to perform a compliance with recommendations and we would update all of the letters at this point because there are up to include updated letters as well as the brand new office of diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5801.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was originally included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5802.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So based on those conditions, if we can have a motion to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5808.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: grants a special permit to, uh, for the approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5813.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What conditions as do we have, would we have to state them again, Amanda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5859.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize I mentioned that and we would do the list but neglected to add it as a condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5865.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5883.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that, we'll be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5885.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seeing no other conditions from the board or no other input, do we have a motion to grant a special permit to 200 Boston Ave for approval with conditions as stated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5899.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is Christy, I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5903.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, I'm going to do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5904.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll start with Claes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5912.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5926.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5926.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw you say, I saw you mouthing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5929.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5930.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, and myself, I am a yes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5941.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Amanda, I don't know if you want to put the SPR standards for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5946.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can read them out for the public purpose and the board can go through them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5953.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for one, the provisions of vehicular loading and unloading, what we are looking at now for the actual site plan review, as we all know, we're looking at the provisions for vehicular loading and unloading and parking and for vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the site and into adjacent public streets and ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5974.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It will not create hazards to safety or impose a significant burden upon public facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5980.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, the bulk location or height of proposed buildings and structures and paved areas and the proposed uses thereof will not be detrimental to other private development in the neighborhood and will not impose undue burdens on the sewers, sanitary and storm drains, water distribution system or similar public facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=5998.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm going to pause for really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6000.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, we've done site plan review and I think we all know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6004.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just rereading this because of our previous activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6007.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do I continue to read this or since the board is well aware of this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6039.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6047.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one difference that I see with this is a question I was in, I'm not sure if it was covered earlier and how you were going to handle the trash removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6062.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's to Mr. Avini.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6088.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6091.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we discussed exterior lighting earlier with one of the provisions that Police Anderson has already laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6100.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does any board members have anything else that they want to add as far as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6106.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the site plan overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6126.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's almost like a repeat of everything that we've already gone over, and especially with all of the conditions that we've already had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6132.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend the site plan for approval for 200 Boston now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6151.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6157.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6158.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6162.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6164.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6165.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6241.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, Director Hunt, do you have any input on, is there something in the ordinance that says how long a special permit is valid for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6627.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6627.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6640.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just but I feel that saying places last name, and properly, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6647.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Andreessen Andreessen I know how to say your last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6684.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll give a motion to move it along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6688.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6701.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=6713.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=7228.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=7235.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/39QZXkKLDII&t=7240.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=4422.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I actually had circulation question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=4425.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=4431.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have any because the presentation actually went over everything, so I didn't want to reiterate something that was already presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=4441.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it was thoroughly covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=5272.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10357.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, David, it has a lot with the fact that you're also an attorney and if anyone was going to understand what was going on tonight you'd be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10376.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10376.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10921.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I apologize, Kyle, I don't mean to interrupt you but there's something I should, I want to make sure there's not a conflict and I want to make sure that there's nothing precluding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10930.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the approval from the board for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10932.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Julie Cowan is my quasi-partner over at Mass Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10936.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I work for the Secretary of Economic Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10939.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: SSBCI funding comes through my channels, and I just wanted to make sure that there's no conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10944.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if, David, if you're able to answer that question, but I just want to make sure that I'm not the reason that the proponent won't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10963.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just don't want to make sure that Kyle and Brian does not come after me if there's anything that concludes this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=10974.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NSwzzTDsSZ4&t=16645.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, sorry I'm accused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=93.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Welcome, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=396.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I may, David, this is Jackie, vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=400.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before the proponent moves forward, Amanda or Alicia, if you can provide some background, I know on A&R generally, we must have enough frontage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=410.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=411.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause it doesn't really necessarily require a formal review process by the planning board, but we have to make sure that there's proper frontage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=419.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=420.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm unable to do that as presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=424.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to be a little bit more clear before the proponent continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=808.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we move to the final vote, David, I just want to make sure, going back to what Alicia says, although the wetland will not preclude the approval for the ANR, if the lot is not buildable, will that have any kind of bearing going forward or are we able to just approve it as is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=854.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which it meets the minimum requirements of square footage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=857.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will vote, I'll second the approval of the ANR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=959.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have any questions other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=961.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean I don't have any input, other than, are we able to approve them tonight and we have a quorum for the minutes because of fools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=970.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Andre LaRose not in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=972.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to make sure that we had enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1264.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1265.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1380.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To be clear, Dover Amendment covers the use of educational, educational uses, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1385.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just like I know there's one for specifically for religious uses, like we need a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1390.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So yes, it's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1463.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, I'm usually not available on Wednesdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1465.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a little bit difficult for me going into, based on what my other commitments are, but I can probably try to move things around for that date, because it'll be easier for me to have October 12th to look at, as opposed to everything else, because this is the Baker-Polito administration's last year, and they are going, we're about to do the one-stop announcements soon, and they're trying to pack it all in in October, November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=1489.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: December, so I don't know when I'll be available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=2049.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll give a motion to adjourn, David.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l9sbFKsBmFs&t=2054.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Christie, I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3117.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19657.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19659.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe Ryan Hayward should be on the Zoom call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19664.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Eastie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=205.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Andre, this is Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=206.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I present the motion to approve the minutes from December 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=2595.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Andre, this is Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=2596.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=2619.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3422.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to echo your thanks to David for all the work that he put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3430.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did look over and I don't really have any objections because it just looks, I mean, all the work that was put into it, he just made it that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3438.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's very clear, the clarity of it, so much so that a couple of things stood out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3442.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering if we were to implement this, when do we start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3446.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like for instance, it was just brought to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3448.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, Andre, we'll be losing you as chair at the end of your term soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3454.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do know that it says going forward, there'll be one year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3459.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: term for chairs, but it doesn't say what the term is for vice chairs and so forth, so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3464.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just trying to figure that out in between.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3467.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been an honor to be a vice chair alongside you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3470.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I also want to make sure that we're conforming and giving other people that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3476.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are the only questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3478.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was so good, David, that it got me thinking along those lines of just how we're going to implement it and follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3504.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I thought that's what I saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3506.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe you struck the language, but I'm almost positive I saw that within the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3512.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but it could have been something you struck out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3566.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3568.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And even with saying that, I mean, again, with getting a new chair, I'm just wondering, are we going to have like an election, a re-election for vice chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3577.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're going along with what is suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3599.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3816.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3821.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second it, it's Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3838.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3842.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=3845.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4187.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's everything on my end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4191.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, Andre, this is Jackie, I just wanted to clarify on that going back to the zoning map change, Amanda, are you able to give a little bit of specifics about what that zoning change would be for 200 blocks and I'm just a little, I thought that was like a shared space already, like with toughs being there and just like office space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4209.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just wondering what that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4212.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: change would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4213.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Amanda, do you want me to speak to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4316.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WpieqDvHvyY&t=4319.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=262.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've never been here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=425.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you, I'm not here to receive a plaque tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=428.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, what I'm here is to commend my fellow elected officials who are leaving their posts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=436.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very shortly, Michael Marks and John Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=439.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had the opportunity over the years to work with many fine individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=444.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you know, sometimes we agreed and sometimes we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=447.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we always had found some place to have common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=451.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's so important in today's world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=454.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to thank you, Michael, for the years that I served with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=457.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You were such a kid then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=460.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=461.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And john, it was such a pleasure to serve with you for the years to watch you both go on to the city council, and we're going to miss you very very much so thank you so much, and my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=473.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing that I think every elected official, whether we agree or disagree, there is a common bond between us, because of the years we've learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=483.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to go out to campaign every two years and to put your families through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=489.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you both have such wonderful, wonderful families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=492.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was really pleasure of mine to watch, to know when they were born and to watch them grow, to graduate from high school, to go on to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=502.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really been a pleasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=504.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=505.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And George, thank you for your kind words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=508.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=509.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=510.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I appreciate my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=701.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, give a hoot was so popular, he tried to take it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=731.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=732.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=734.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the problems with masks is nobody can see me smile, and I just want you to know I'm printing ear to ear, so thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5987.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, okay, we're back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4771.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to bring to the attention just in case somebody wants to let somebody know who's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4778.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a problem with the audio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4780.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Comcast is having a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4782.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we're working with that through Medford Community Media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4784.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4784.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John's on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4785.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it says that if people want to go, if anybody wants to text friends, they can go to the Medford's YouTube channel to be able to watch the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5101.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7091.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just in response to my colleague, I will tell you that I know that over the years that there's been any number of times where parents have chosen to withdraw their child before an expulsion because they didn't want an expulsion on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7107.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so it's a very interesting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7109.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: area, but that could account for some of the differences that have happened in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7116.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did want to thank the students who spoke out clearly tonight, and to all of the students who've been articulate during this period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7126.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that as the events unfolded, I did go and have conversations with key people just to make sure I felt comfortable that I knew that our staff was handling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7141.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I even drove by from a distance when there was a walkout on Friday, observing then the superintendent, Dr. Cushing, and many of our other administrators talking to the groups of students engaged in conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7156.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and getting the sort of feedback which will only be more helpful to us as we go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7161.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate your work, and I appreciate the students coming forth and being active, because that's what it's ultimately going to take for us to improve the current climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7173.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been a difficult time for everybody and we are not unique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7180.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the sort of issues that we're facing in Medford right now are being faced across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7185.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while that in no means makes it okay, I think it's an interesting thing to understand the dynamics of society right now and how they're affecting our kids and why it's so important that we listen to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7306.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7309.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just prior to my leaving for the meeting, I checked and the only letter I had was from our student, Catherine, which you've all heard now and I sent to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9673.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9674.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just real quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9675.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So are students being assessed for the family report four times a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9682.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9685.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the idea that it might, for those students who haven't achieved fluency, would it ultimately go up to maybe through the third grade or is it, you know, will it grow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9758.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9761.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10965.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just because I think it's appropriate to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10968.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's take the $50,000 figure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10972.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Given our expenditures to date, is it realistic to that we will be able to cover that expense given our budget expenses so far this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10986.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess I'm asking Mr. Murphy that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11052.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11053.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess my question is, are our expenses running as expected, or are they widely more than we expected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11062.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And should we be concerned about spending a significant amount of money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11066.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, again, part of the problem is it may not be significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11155.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11156.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's exactly what I was hoping you'd say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4576.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4577.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this sounds like very interesting and challenging work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4582.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4584.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, where were the engagement specialists housed in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4588.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we found offices for them all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4591.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I can't believe that wasn't a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4636.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was actually my second question was, you know, part of this is, is that they have to find their place within the schools, right, and to a point that Mr. Murphy made earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4647.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes they've had to be utilized as coverage, but frankly, that sometimes is the time when you really get to see a broad view of students, and this can be very very valuable to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4659.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whoever works in the school so I actually think, especially at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4663.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's an asset, even, you know, I understand it's time consuming, but it does allow someone to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4671.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, my other question is so let's suppose said person, one of your reengagement specialist is something that we as adults understand the terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4681.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What will the kids call these individuals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4684.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where do they fit in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4753.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess, you know, I'm just thinking for the youngest kids, something like a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4757.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: helping hand or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4759.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, you know something, something that something, even a helper I'm a helper that someplace I can just see them being in the school and trying to say, how do they define their place with the title, which is child friendly helper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4777.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5573.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to clarify, so the students were moved, or was this an event where the teacher came in and found the water in the?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5583.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After the evening or weekend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5591.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the students were moved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5599.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then are the ceiling tile has been replaced at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5606.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are the kids back in that original classroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5608.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, they're definitely back in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this was one classroom at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5627.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5630.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three kindergarten classrooms were affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5636.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5637.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the things which I'm just going to comment on is that I feel almost like our rules and regulations about how we address something, I think we're unfortunate in this case because we had a member of the public come up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5658.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and show some photos, and it says we're not supposed to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5664.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And yet it was very clear to me that the superintendent had been down, that she knew a lot about this, that you knew a lot about this, but because it says we're not supposed to respond, that family who was sitting here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5681.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: walked away without any answers, just, and we did what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5685.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We said we referred it and asked you for information today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5689.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there's a process thing, which is difficult for me, only because if we're following our rules, then we're not responding to a person with an immediate concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5700.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think it doesn't speak to the strength of the administrative team who knew everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5708.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could have answered the questions last week with a follow-up today or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5716.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I find that to be, as someone who's been on the committee for a long time, a very difficult place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5720.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand we're following procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5723.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To the end, the only thing I could think of, frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5728.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to the superintendent is to say, please be more proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5733.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a situation you knew about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5735.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It probably should have been in your report, so we could have spoken about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5739.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if something like that's the thing, the only thing my sort of plea to you is to be, I think you guys did everything right, that you were on top of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5750.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But unfortunately, when it was presented, because we were following our rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5756.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it didn't look like you were as on top of the situation as you actually were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5804.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't, and it never will, because when things happen like that, it's going to be a problem for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5810.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But on the other hand, since we did know it was going to be on the agenda, if it had been included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5817.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the superintendent's remarks, we could have said, we're going to hold that until later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5823.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, frankly, I'm trying to do a workaround around our rule, which makes sense for other reasons, but is sometimes challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5833.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not going to be here to do it, but I am saying to my committee members, this is an interesting dilemma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5861.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I guarantee you that when there's something like this particular problem, it's going to get to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5866.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it's going to get, you know, it's not a surprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5869.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5871.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, and it also leads us to just ask the question right now, is there, are we experiencing, there's always leaks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5879.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we experiencing anything else that you've got your eye on, that you're concerned about in another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5909.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of, this seems like possibly this is a roofing issue, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5916.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Say it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5921.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this a roofing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5972.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, this isn't something which is going to be solved by putting on a new roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5976.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this saying we need a new roof?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6309.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just want to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6311.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, as I recall, as my brain fog lifts, Mia's absolutely right, my colleague, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6317.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mastones, because I do, in fact, remember that we fixed this problem before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6325.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that, you know, that's part of the problem is that we fix problems, and they happen again, and they happen again and with all good intentions that people thought that they got to the root of it the last time we had put together, if we, if we go back at least two, four years when we were doing the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6366.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that document is one that should surface again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6482.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's asking the administration that if something like this occurs again, where children are moved out of the classroom because of a major issue like this, that you included in the report of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6498.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I think that's the easiest way to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6732.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to ask the administration as to whether a timetable like this is doable, realistic, and what, if not, what would be realistic given the obvious desire of the committee to move the budget discussions up earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6530.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6535.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We voted to apply for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6554.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we all certainly appreciated that we were going to get an opportunity to only promise it as I read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6561.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are one or two things that, you know, I read one, the district is putting out tons of communication, too dense, not too way, need to find balance and simplicity, coordinating communication, different methods, platforms can be difficult for administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6576.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is anybody remember that we were in the middle of a pandemic and that we were sending out tons of information because there needed to be tons of information sent out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6584.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so there's a couple of these comments that I would, I would step back from and say, let's think about the timing and what are our expectations, and what was the need at the time that need at the time was to get a lot of information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6597.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was very dense, it was difficult it was so if you think about the number of meetings that we all went to in March alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6604.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with, which was just overwhelming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6608.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As one member could say, I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6611.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, the, we, you know, I think that there was very many positive things about this, I actually think that member grams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6622.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: request to send it to the subcommittee so that the two now become working together makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6627.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But most importantly, Member McLaughlin, if you were willing to check out the date and let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=5035.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like a motion for adjournment, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2421.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, I have two letters from the public that need to be included at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2429.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2430.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is from a citizen Justine Deutsch Myers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2437.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2438.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that she lives at 197 Playstead Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2442.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What, if anything can be done, this is just what we were talking about, within the schools to increase the COVID vaccination rates in the 12 to 15 year old student group and then 16 to 19 year old students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2453.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: According to the map published by CBS Boston last week, Medford's vaccination rate of 12 to 15 year olds is just 57%, and the rate for 16 to 19 year olds is 60%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2467.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have there been vaccination clinics in the middle schools and MHS for students and or other initiatives to improve on these rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2475.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you been collaborating or discussing strategies with other cities and towns nearby that have higher rates of vaccination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2484.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our numbers are lower than neighboring cities and towns in our local region for, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2490.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 12 to 15 year olds Arlington has 90% Somerville is 83% Malden has 60% Melrose 76% and Medford is down at 57% 1619 year olds again similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2504.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where Medford trails significantly behind the other towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2508.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, if you could specifically ask, have we done vaccination clinics and are there any more scheduled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2516.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are they effective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2518.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would be my question to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2520.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you reached out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2521.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there anything else we can learn from other cities who are doing better than we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2527.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would add just is, do incentives help at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2531.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2534.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you do the, you know, win a gift card or whatever, just that help at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2666.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, the next letter comes also from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2695.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2697.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think for parents it's convenient if it's right at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2699.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, so the second letter is from citizen Christina McCordy, and she's a 24 North Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2708.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's multiple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2717.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, air quality checks in the school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2719.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said that we were told that air filters would be replaced often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2726.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we have an update on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2727.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the filters are not replaced often, she says the air quality cannot be guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2755.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's specifically asking about air filters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2841.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would they just, I'm asking you, would they be changed around, say, December 1st again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2850.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Quarterly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2851.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe you could just give us an update when that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2884.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2886.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: School staff have ongoing concerns regarding the room temperature in classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2891.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Warm classrooms, she says, lead to more improper mask wearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2895.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, when you cannot feel the AC, it is hard to know if the air is blowing, which leads to worries about airflow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2902.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Work requests have been repeatedly ignored, she says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2905.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So please detail what staff need to do to get these concerns addressed, and please make sure it is communicated to all staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3028.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, number three, many teachers or staff at our school are interested in additional your air purification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3035.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The PTO at our school would like to purchase box fans with more 13 filters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3041.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are under $100 each but most of our classroom teachers are interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3045.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we request the use of code would bend to put toward this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3050.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For equity sake, we would like this offer to all school buildings, our PTO will also put some funds toward this is their formal process to request coded funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3161.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With the air testing that we're having done now, if there was such an area, would it automatically be put in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3172.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3177.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Fourth and lastly, can we have an update on staffing issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3180.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we close to returning to testing twice per week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3236.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I received one more letter, just just as it came in as you were speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3241.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, this is from Ingrid Mercado 131 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3247.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, I'd like to comment about the idea presented by Mr. Murphy of not having a standing COVID update in the agenda every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3255.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern about taking it out of the agenda is that the public wouldn't be able to have public participation during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3261.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think COVID topics are important and the public needs to be able to ask questions and get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3266.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In my experience, school committee meetings are the only way to get these answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3269.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, I've sent multiple questions to administration and I haven't received answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3275.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She notes nurses at the school level are fantastic and give us great information during our PTO meeting, but sometimes we want answers at the district level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3795.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't see it at all, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4166.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4167.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just clarify?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4168.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the test has already been given to students K to 12?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4693.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you still have a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4695.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4697.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's given at the beginning of the year in October, February and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4703.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6918.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a dress code is in the student handbooks, is at least mentioned in the student handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6928.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6952.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee is supposed to approve the handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6955.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's just a point of that it's generally been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6960.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there's been discussions over the dress code for many years at many different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6967.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly support looking at it and updating it, but it's not like it's never been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6985.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, the refinement is that there's always been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6988.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the understanding that the policy that we approved that the the handbooks and that becomes what you're saying is we don't have a separate one in our policy handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=7000.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well we're quibbling over it but I'm just mentioning that it's in the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=791.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=792.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I should probably read them at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=796.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=797.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=798.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=811.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina McCourty 24 North Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=813.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes dear members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=817.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm the parent of two elementary school students and I'm writing with a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=822.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, at this point, is there any evidence that points to possible interschool spread of COVID-19?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=829.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Watching the COVID tracker there was an increase in positive cases in a couple of buildings, and many of us are wondering if there were multiple cases in the same classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=839.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to take this one by one or if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=998.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This parent goes on to say, is there any update on when buildings can transition back to testing twice per week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1005.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She mentions that she knows the kindergarten students are being tested daily and says if that's happening, she would think we could handle testing all students twice per week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1015.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1114.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The third part of the email is, some first grade students have begun unmasking in class for phonics lessons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1121.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Though this was briefly mentioned in an email communication, no details have been given on what this looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1127.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a right to know what risks our students are taking and which health professionals weighed in on this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1133.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Going forward, can someone from the district please give a detailed description of unmasked situations that have been deemed to be necessary for instruction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1141.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before they happen for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1143.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any unmasking brings risks, and I think families have the right to know of any increased risks they are facing at school so we can reflect on it, ask questions, and determine whether we decide if the risk is acceptable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1156.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many students are also anxious about being unmasked indoors, and knowing in advance would give us caretakers the ability to prepare them and discuss it in a safe place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1237.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'll turn to the next person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1242.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This one is Ingrid Moncada 131 virgin have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1249.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a few questions regarding COVID protocols at MPS, and she writes in parentheses, a comprehensive document with MPS current policies would be ideal, so we'd have to keep asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1260.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, what's the data that supports the decision of testing kindergarten in such a different way than the rest of the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1268.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1269.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there evidence of in-school transmissions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1322.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, this one touches on what you've just talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1326.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the criteria for quarantining a whole class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1329.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it because the whole class is considered close contact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1332.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How can that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1334.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How often does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1335.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it only in kindergarten classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1395.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Part three, what are the guidelines for students returning to school after being sick at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1399.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard reports of people having to provide proof of coven negative and pay for a private PCR test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1406.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before being accepted back in school, and others that are not told anything, and just bring the kids back as soon as they feel better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1556.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The parent goes on to say, has the district or city considered providing free COVID testing for NPS families at schools after hours City Hall or other Medford location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1567.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If families are indeed required to provide proof of negative test before returning to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1571.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This would be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all the letters that I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1706.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on the school committee mailbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple questions just sort of in understanding the scope of your work in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4843.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you've outlined three different areas, which I assume are for all K to 12 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4857.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All K to 12 staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4858.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So like, we don't have that much time for professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4864.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When are you coming in and how many people are coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4867.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you could just give us an understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4987.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess if I could go back, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as you're training the in-district, what is the scope of that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4995.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are you training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4997.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are you meeting with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5065.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5066.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5070.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You say taught in our book, social emotional learning in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5075.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are those resources that are used, is that something that the school committee can take a look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5102.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can go find it in your office, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5105.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5128.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it available online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5278.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5279.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5595.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I find it a little confusing, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5599.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of it is the wording is presentations of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5602.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And does the presentation mean a statement or, for instance, a letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5646.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, I have another letter that has been submitted to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5660.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't have to do with anything particular on our agenda so it wasn't a pub.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5665.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we did earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5667.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have a public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5668.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, Mayor Sorry, remember Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5674.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So but we've always had an opportunity for people if this person was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5680.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier in the meeting where it used to be, they would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5693.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's my fear is that you're cutting out the ability of a person to ask a question, which I understand isn't necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5704.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like if I read this letter, I'm not expecting that there's going to be a dialogue, but the person wrote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5710.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that we did this whole thing about having letters submitted so that people who aren't here, we could read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5750.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in one hand, you're saying that the goal is to be inclusive and welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5755.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And on the other hand, we're saying, but here's someone who's written a letter, but I can't read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5762.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't really understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5787.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5813.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this was submitted to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5816.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My job has been to read the letters that were submitted to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5822.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This person chose that way rather than writing us individually, which I actually think that there's a benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5830.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that there would be no discussion about this, but to not read it, and again, I happen to know what the letter contains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just making a general observation that it seems to me that we've become, with this policy, the well-intended to correct another problem is in fact causing another concern that I am articulating right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5855.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this person, Monica Rushford, who submitted this letter, is not going to have her letter read tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5863.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to read the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5876.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5877.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a Medford resident and a parent of Missy Tuck Elementary students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5880.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious whether there will be any kind of acknowledgement or dedication of the new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5885.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did see the banner on the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5887.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd love to know if other signage or explanation of the significance of the name is under consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5892.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard, for example, about a mural on the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5895.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would that be the school committee's decision or the school's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5899.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5901.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Monica Rushford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8042.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very well member of and include needs to present to the school nurse, a physical copy of the PCR test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8279.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8498.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8500.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one on the next page, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8501.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3213.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanna add, this is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3219.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3219.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3220.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4391.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it would make sense to me and yeah, appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4524.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this letter is from Cheryl Rodriguez of 281 Park Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4530.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, hello, I'm writing concerned about the lack of a permanent crossing guard at the intersection of Riverside Ave and Freedom Way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4538.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are three schools that utilize that crosswalk, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and the Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4545.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am grateful that the Medford police cross children there when they can, but understandably, they need to leave it if there is a call leaving no one to cross our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4554.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is even more urgent as bus 11 formally dropped off at spring street and central lab was canceled for the middle school, and those children now have to walk without benefit of a crossing guard on that very busy street bus 11 was created because there were so many children on bus to that they could accommodate them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4573.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am unsure of how many children lost bus service with this move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4576.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: likely inspired by the driver shortages, but the families received no notice and have added to the number of children likely unaccompanied that are crossing at the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4587.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please prioritize getting a crossing guard to this location immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4592.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Cheryl Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2601.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are we doing to support that students academics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2606.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I understand we have our limits, but it seems like now you know they're out for five days they're out for seven days, what if it's a second grader, what do we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2789.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, obviously, you would understand my concern for a student who's come back to school and then all of a sudden is out and might be out again a few weeks later and a few weeks later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2800.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I think that, you know, I know we've brought in some support people, I think we sometimes may need more, maybe as tutors for students who are out and so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2811.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is something that I think we need to very closely monitor, and I'm most concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2903.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have other questions but I'll yield to my colleagues, they can get an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3393.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to say I'm really glad that the high school testing is being revamped because that was one of my concerns after our visitation so that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3403.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question I was just curious about is whether it may be too soon, but I'd like to know if what percentage of our, and I'll ask it as high school students but of our high school students are vaccinated do we know at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3741.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just to follow up on member credits question, we had received a letter from a parent expressing concern that there were at least three kids in the bathroom when her daughter walked in periodically so you know I know I know it's tough to monitor at all but you know, I just wanted to your attention yeah the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3773.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I think we might have all gotten it, but I'll make sure I forward it on to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3919.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3926.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, I read the document that member Ruseau provided to us in detail, and as a former representative to with shore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3934.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am very familiar with shore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3938.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, remember, Hank Owen, the director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3943.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of many years, very rightly, is a wonderful wonderful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3949.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question that came to me is that this is basically calling for a fund to be put aside for capital improvements for sure, which makes a great deal of sense, but I didn't see anything addressing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3964.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the potential for, if by any chance, something should happen to the shore such that it would cease to exist, what would happen of the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3976.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there was no, I didn't see any line item which suggested that it would be split back between the districts or anything else like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3984.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while it is perhaps far-fetched to believe something will happen after the successful run of shore, it seemed to me that some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3993.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some notation should be made about what would happen to that account in the future if it was not used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4064.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, my suggestion is that simply that should be added to this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4070.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'm happy to refer it to your attorney as to whether that needs to be or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4078.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that was my one concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4080.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Otherwise, I would make a motion to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4101.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should it be a roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4103.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it should be a roll call as regards to finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4121.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4297.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4298.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4299.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was asked to inquire about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4301.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the original date that employees were supposed to give you documentation was September 8th, and then it was put off to the 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4311.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you explain why that happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4379.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that perhaps the interpretation might have been by some people that it was, oh, people aren't getting their stuff in, so we're giving them extra time, and they're dragging their feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4388.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make it clear that, in fact, we are having great cooperation with our labor units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4434.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, well I think we're all very thankful to our labor units and I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the agreements that were set forth around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4447.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would you say around the mandatory coven 19 testing and proof of vaccination requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=5357.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, member McLaughlin is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6055.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6057.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we're under the topic of transportation, it would seem we received a letter from a member of the public, which would be appropriate to read at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6066.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6068.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So community member Eleanor Klein wrote us to the school committee account regarding bicycle racks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6078.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she wrote that she wants to draw our attention to the bike racks at the middle and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6086.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She included some photos of the bike racks, which she says the racks are outdated models<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6093.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and unusable and difficult to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6095.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition, they represent a very small percentage of available space dedicated to students alternative non-fossil fuel dependent transportation options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6105.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She says she knows that the ones at the high school are frequently filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6110.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure the bike commission CC here can be valuable resource for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6114.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With the partnership connector she writes the opportunities for middle schoolers to bike to school safely will be expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6121.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition, we as a city need to work on ways to encourage more cycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6125.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would love it if we could start by making sure an ample quantity of usable racks are installed at our middle and high schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6132.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a plan or discussion around bike racks currently in our budget transportation planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6137.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If not, please make sure that this is added to the mix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6140.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks very much, Ellery Klein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6143.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do want to note that Dr. Cushing did respond and is willing to further the conversation and work with whomever he can to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6855.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're allowed one delegate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6857.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6858.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6861.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, we need to nominate our voting delegate in an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6866.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And every school committee member is welcome to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6871.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is just the particular voting portion of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6879.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6914.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll still go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6915.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't want to be the delegate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7208.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I certainly would support this but I do want to let you know that it isn't the first time that it's been discussed that when we in fact built the new schools there were discussions about accommodating left handed students at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7223.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It came up again over a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7226.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's one of those things that it's just always good, though, to check on whether they're in the right place at the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7233.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And do we need more just because of the particular population?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7237.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, some of the deaths have bit the dust, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7240.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might be replacing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7243.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have, I don't know, with right-handed deaths rather than left-handed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7248.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7253.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that it's appropriate for us so since there is an expenditure potentially for us to get a report back so that we understand what we're asking for in terms of if we have an additional purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=380.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So looking at the, I don't know whether<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=384.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau who tabulated the responses wants to say anything at this point, but looking it over, I see that my colleagues hold you in the same high esteem that I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=396.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because as I look over the different scores, all of which are often 3.5 or above with four being the highest, you can see that's truly a remarkable standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=411.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=413.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we all value so much what you set out this year, your achievement in getting kids back to school, holding the safety of our students to the highest level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=429.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think you should be really proud of yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3233.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3234.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I did want to thank the team, those who presented yesterday to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3240.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for representing us so well and answering all the questions that were brought to you last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3250.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to go back to Suzanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3252.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you were talking about the camp, sort of reintroducing kids back to school and whatever, what are the numbers that you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3260.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anticipate, how many kids can you accommodate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3263.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would hope that everybody who wants to go gets to go, but I wanted to understand how you're facing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3384.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=920.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hey, Tony, you wrote this article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1118.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 2021 Robert Leo Sean garbled a Christine Barber and Paul Donato Tony, I just want to take a second to say in addition to these words, you have just been invaluable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1128.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is so wonderful to see your entire team here too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1139.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Tony, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1140.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so, so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1144.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then thank you for getting us through the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1146.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony worked tirelessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1149.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She worked on weekends around the clock to make sure that our students and teachers were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1158.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1981.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We took a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2027.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we do that, after that, as we're taking things out of order, I would ask that we move on to the presentation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2035.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2065.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I am happy to stay here to get to the entire agenda, no matter how late we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2072.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in the meantime, we have an audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2074.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we know why they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2075.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2077.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know why that we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2078.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've already asked them graciously, not really asked, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2081.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They graciously sat here for our wonderful presentation to Toni Wray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2086.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We wanna take up our seventh graders and that I think it's only appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2090.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guarantee you to my colleague, we will get to everything on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2096.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No one's gonna rush out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2665.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2666.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing is, I wondered whether we should specify one, because if there's one or more, or because sometimes if you're putting in one, putting in a second one might not be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2677.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't want to limit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2702.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3189.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is our rubric, and it was used by our committee to evaluate the names of the submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3197.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The rubric outlined three different criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3201.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the potential for the name to bring the community together, two, the potential for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and three, the potential for the name to represent Medford community's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3216.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each one of the criteria had a scoring range from one to four, four being the highest a name could receive in any category, and one being the lowest score that a name should have received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3229.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thus, the top score of any one suggestion that they could receive is a 12, and any name with a 12 would be significant to multiple historically marginalized groups and not polarizing, known for exceptional deeds, community involvement, or contribution to society with a historical notable legacy that would last decades, or if it wasn't a person, it would still have historical significance that would last decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3255.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And lastly, if it was a person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3258.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They would have lived in Medford with a Medford specific reputation, or if it was not a person, it would have a long standing ties to Medford with a positive history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3272.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our public participation process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3275.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After all of the names were scored, the top scoring 15 names were to move on with the public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3282.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, due to a tie, we ended up with a top 17 names to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3287.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then after looking at the list, we realized we had accidentally removed a name that should have been considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3292.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we therefore added that name on to continue with the process, leaving us with 18 names to present to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3301.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On May 11th, the committee adopted and formalized a process of how we should receive public input on those 18 names as outlined in a resolution brought forward by Heinrich Ginnies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3312.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a subcommittee was established to create the public input form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3316.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the survey was open for one week to collect written responses for or against any of the 18 names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3323.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The survey itself was translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Portuguese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3329.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were hard copies also made available at Medford City Hall and the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3334.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And overall, the committee received over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3346.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The top 18 names were also independently researched and rescored by each of the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3352.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: via the process previously described by the rubric, all 23 members of the advisory committee did this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3360.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The scores were then collected, averaged, and ranked as one point for the committee members to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3366.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The committee then moved forward to reduce the finalists down to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3374.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using an adopted process as outlined and brought forth by Patrick McCabe, the committee started with a list of names in alphabetical order, and if a committee member had stated that that name was their top three, that name would remain in consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3389.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If no one on the committee said they would include that name in their top three, that name was stricken from the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3395.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This reduced the official list down from 18 to 13 names,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3400.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And next, every committee member was given up to three minutes to advocate for which nominee or nominees they thought should be sent forward to the school committee based on their own research, the rubric and public input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3413.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each committee member voted for one of the nominees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3419.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And after the first round of votes were recorded, only three of the candidates had received a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3424.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a motion put forth by Paul Donato Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3427.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: was made that we should just accept those three and send them forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3431.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was adopted and the three names that received votes were on the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3441.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so our first few names that, these three names were Missituk, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3450.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first of the three names here for you tonight is Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3454.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The land that the city of Medford sits on was inhabited by the Massachusetts tribe and other Native Americans for thousands of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3463.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The indigenous people that lived on the land called the river Missituk, which means Great Tidal River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3469.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As English colonists came to the area, the name of the river was altered in a more familiar English word, Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3478.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The river has been very important throughout the history of Medford, and it was used for fishing and for water by the indigenous tribe, and then by the colonists, and it also became essential for trade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3491.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It became a subject of poems, such as, Over the River and Through the Wood, and Paul Revere's Ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3497.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This river has been a source of community pride for centuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3505.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Missituk River,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3506.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as previously mentioned, has been bringing people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3510.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a source of the food and water for indigenous tribes and the first colonists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3514.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It then became a place that allowed Medford to take part in trade industry, being a port and preparing goods to ship out and even building ships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3524.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The city of Medford grew because of the Mistook River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3528.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And today, the river is used for walking, hiking, boating, fishing, and other various community events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3536.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a widespread effort underway to continue to work to restore the river and the land surrounding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3541.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by using the Native American name, Misutuk, we are taking time to honor those who had originally inhabited these lands and taking a step to acknowledge the past and as we do this, stepping into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3558.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are just three responses that we received from the community input survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3564.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were so many wonderful responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3567.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And even though that this was not a vote, all of these responses were used and considered and provided the committee wonderful information into getting us to these final three names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3582.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These three quotes here really exemplified why Missittook is a positive influence, not only for the city and for the students of the school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3593.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but also for the rest of the children in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3597.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of the feedback expressed that it was a reflection of the river and how the river has been a focal point for our community for centuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3606.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: People also shared that it acknowledged the native people for who originally inhabited this land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3613.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it also provided a physical connection between our past and our present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3618.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was also shared that people liked it because it wasn't a single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3623.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but rather it celebrated a shared space and an aspect of a physical environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3631.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And lastly, Missittook represents Medford's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3636.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As previously mentioned, the Missittook has been here long before Medford has even existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3644.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Missittook watershed was home to the indigenous people of Massachusetts prior to colonization of the area by the Europeans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3652.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The name may have morphed into Mystic, but it does not diminish the role or the value of the Missitook River and what it has played in building Medford by providing resources of not only food, but also trade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3666.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The river powered tide mills that allowed for the process of corn, tobacco, textiles, and wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3673.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was the home of the first bridge over the river, allowing the city to play a key part in the founding of this nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3681.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The river is also the subject of well-known poems and stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3686.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while the river may now be known as Mystic, the name Mistituk gives nod to those who came before us, honoring them and acknowledging their language and homelands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3697.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a reminder that Medford's history didn't start when the Europeans came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3701.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It began long before the first boats arrived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4557.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so at the present the 27 letters have ballooned over 40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4563.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to I'm going to condense them where appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4568.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: first from, and I'm starting from the ones that, the first one that came in was from Carrie Parker of 6 Hurlcross Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4576.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She said, I am writing to you because I want to support the renaming of the Columbus Elementary School at tonight's school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4583.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee set up a transparent process carefully naming the committee, and the committee did extensive work to identify three possible names that reflect Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4592.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4594.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am proud that Medford is taking a step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4596.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and look forward to seeing the committee's work completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4598.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's Carrie Parker, 6 Earlcroft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4681.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: because I can't think of a better way to both honor Medford's often unrecognized history and celebrate the diversity of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4901.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, should I do one more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5282.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Next letter I received was from Ellery Klein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5286.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please know that I am supporting you tonight as you face a contentious meeting regarding the school name change for the Columbus Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5292.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to just offer one thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5293.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A friend of color told me she felt that naming the school after an enslaved person, Belinda Sutton, was not inspiring for the kids of color in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5301.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While I initially liked the story as Mrs. Sutton used her obviously strong powers of persuasive writing and the US justice system of the time to earn her freedom and a recompense for her<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5312.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: experience of one of the worst injustices a human being can face and hopefully went on to a better life and freedom, I was willing to hear and absorb this perspective from my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5322.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While I do think it shows agency and power on the part of Miss Sutton, and one could argue that Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman were also enslaved, yet nevertheless,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5330.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: inspiring fears, I do want to make sure that we have heard from enough voices of color to feel comfortable choosing Belinda Sutton as the name should we choose to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5339.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the voices in support of the beloved Medford-educated Jean Barry Sutherland are still unanimous and no hidden secrets have emerged, I also think this is a fine choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5347.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I would urge the mayor to set firm guidelines, which we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5352.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I fully remain in support of the name change of the Columbus to one that is more in line with justice, freedom, hope, and kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5384.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have begun each performance with a land acknowledgement, recognizing the often forgotten people who lived here before European colonization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5429.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5434.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, I liked the name Lydia Maria Childs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5437.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, now I think the name should not be a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5439.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish South Medford Elementary School had been a suggestion, as there is no room for dispute over that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5445.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the choices, I think Missituk would be a good name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5447.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard Missituk won the student vote, which should count for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5451.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It honors our Native American history and our location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5899.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is my background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7026.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7027.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So these are emails that have been received into the school committee account that I am reading for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7033.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am shortening them because of the pure numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7056.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one is by Matt Weyant, W-E-Y-A-N-T of 134 Auburn Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7065.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I strongly support the proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7088.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Michael Denton, One Bellevue Terrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7093.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All three choices are fine, Missittook, Sutton, Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7097.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would, however, offer the following for your consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7102.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the three choices, Missittook would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the indigenous people for whom this land was stolen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7109.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in the grand scheme of thing that represents a small step, but a step nonetheless toward healing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7115.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Another of the choices has been Linda Sutton would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the black people who were kidnapped from their homes in Africa and forcibly brought to the country and made to work as slaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7126.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your third choice, Jean Barry Sutherland would honor the first principal of the school and a person who had a big impact on a number of lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7133.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the surface, it seems like a fine choice,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7135.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, given the larger historical, cultural, and societal context in which we are living, it would also be a choice that serves to reinforce the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7143.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I imagine some might be thinking that choosing the name after Jean Barry Sutherland would be a good compromise name because she was a great educator who impacted a lot of our lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7153.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But please remember this, it's never been more clear than it has over the past five years that this country needs healing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7161.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Shall I go on to a different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7596.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We should have a name that all of the community is comfortable with, not just some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7601.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maggie Petillo of 32 Irving Street says, just wanted to thank school committee and show my support for renaming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7633.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am able to write you because I was a recipient of special education services when I was a child in the 1980s and 1990s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7640.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When the Columbus Elementary School was first named, I would not have been able to attend it, and neither would many of my friends and loved ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7646.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am glad that progress meant I would be included in schools, even though when kids with disabilities first went to public schools, people didn't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7654.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Today, disabled people are included because people fought for change and fought for equality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7659.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: People change, times change, and we see positive progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7688.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Columbus Day and all of the family emphasis on Columbus Day that followed is related to my family history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7694.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My dad's family immigrated from Sicily and faced discrimination here in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7699.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My understanding is that Columbus Day was created in part as a way to uplift Italian heritage in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7705.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and to ease tensions between the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7706.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7710.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus was one of the many people who changed the world through colonialism and capitalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7722.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but I do not want my children to have to extend a school named after someone who represents the beginning of an era of mass exploitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7731.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the holdup?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7735.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I love the idea of naming our school after a local courageous and creative person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7751.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, as we become more aware of how we have neglected to meet the needs of everyone in our community, I truly believe it is time to change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7788.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we think of the horrendous acts of genocide, renaming the school to honor either the indigenous name, this area, or to honor a black woman enslaved at the royal house, who was the first African to ask for reparations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8982.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many adults have made this issue so divisive over the last year and they see the names as choosing sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8990.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also think Mr. Tuck best addresses the request of many of the teachers at the Columbus Elementary School to have a name that wasn't in honor of an individual and to not make anyone feel left out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9039.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the letter, they point out that renaming the school with the name of a place rather than a person is a more neutral option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10427.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was from Michelle Chiccolo and she had sent the school committee actually a letter earlier about reaching out to the Mass Center for Native American Awareness just to get a clarification about the using of indigenous names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10445.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As we heard clarified before, that has to do with using names for sports teams and they would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10460.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we had Jeremy Raeland from Brewster Road and a parent of a second grader at a Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10465.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10466.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's show how the democratic process works and go with the name they chose, Misita.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11308.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to address several things as I speak tonight, things that really need to be talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11314.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to tell you that I really haven't felt this nervous coming to a school committee meeting, and that makes me incredibly sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11322.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This whole divisiveness in our community makes me incredibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11327.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11329.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's been really, really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11331.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I looked out here and I felt better when I came in because I said, oh, wait, why was I nervous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11336.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are, I know these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11337.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11338.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are my neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11339.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These are the person who walks down my street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11341.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11343.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet sometimes during the course of this evening, I've not been feeling very happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11348.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you mean to support each other by the calls and cat calls and whatever, but that's not what we're about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11355.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What we are about is that we've got three great names before us and we're making a very difficult change for some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11363.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that for me is extremely important because I have to be true to myself and people, there will be, no matter what I do, there will be people who are going to be unhappy with my decision or my colleagues' decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11376.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I ask you, by the way, don't, after I speak,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11379.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't clap or catcall and don't do the same for them either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11382.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let us have an intelligent discussion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11385.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You may disagree with us, but I have to tell you, everyone is coming here after giving so much thought and so much pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11397.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I listened to, after when we brought out this discussion, one of the biggest things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11404.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that is motivating me for my discussion is hearing some of the portion of our community who felt disenfranchised by our removing the name Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11417.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I voted to remove the name Columbus because I thought it was the right thing to do, but I heard pain in people speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11426.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I very much recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11428.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11429.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, before I go on, I do want to call out to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11433.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thank you and appreciate the work that you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11436.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: did we know how incredibly difficult we were going to put you into a particular circumstance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11442.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't agree with all of you of what you said when I got to watch pieces of it, but I certainly understood and appreciated the commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11449.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, I felt kind of sorry for you at times when you got to the wordsmithing part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11455.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the other part that was very amusing was when you were talking about the school committee, it was this bunch of overs, what were we going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11460.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11463.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11467.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My long-term here on the school committee means that there were names who were on the list who didn't make it in to even that list of whatever it was, 17 or 18 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11478.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony Lucci, my God, what a guy he was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11482.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He owned the sports store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11484.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He loved kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11485.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He gave every kid, if they needed some free shoes or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11489.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we have recognized Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11491.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We put his name up on the corner, but he's a guy who was terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11496.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Miriam Morrissey, another fabulous educator, a person in our community, sister of Amelia Earhart, but someone who really stayed and worked in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11507.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't get to meet Alphonse Fresa, but he was the editor of the Medford Mercury, and they used to call him Mr. Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11516.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were doing this years ago, his name would have been at the top of the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11521.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ray Murano was superintendent of schools, and there were others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11526.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, part of the interesting thing about this is what we remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11530.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are we calling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11531.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I have an advantage over some of my committee members because I knew Jean Barry Sutherland personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11539.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11541.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I have that advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11544.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I think about the others and people have said, do the right thing, but of course, do the right thing means something different to each one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11550.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's like, do the right thing, do the right thing, but we're interpreting that in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11555.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, I'm being true to what I've said and true to myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11560.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Belinda Sutton's story is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11563.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to celebrate her in Medford, not at the Royal House, but someplace else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11569.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have authority to name other things in the city, but maybe when we look, the Belinda Sutton community room at the new library, the Belinda Sutton something, I think that we can, what we have learned about her in this process is extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11585.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's appreciation from everybody of saying, yeah, wow, I didn't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11589.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, our kids do get to go to the royal house in fifth grade, and they do learn about Belinda Sutton at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11596.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just wanted you to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11597.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They do, it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11599.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe they don't remember it, but it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11603.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Missituk, I also totally appreciate the name and the origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11608.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I walk next to the Mystic River every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11612.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I look at that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11614.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The biggest concern for me is in fact, the students who had the poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11619.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tuck got 107 votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11621.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry got 84.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11623.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Belinda Sutton got 86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11625.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I look at 84 and 86, that's 170.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11627.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So then there is, you know, it was a three-way vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11630.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't a two-way vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11632.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, of course, democratically, if it's, you know, whoever gets the highest vote, I am stuck with that because I wonder if Jean Barry would be saying, go with the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11639.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's my only problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11641.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I knew Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11643.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her when she was selected to represent Medford in Nobioka, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11649.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was an incredible honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11651.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two educators were going off to represent Medford in our sister city of Japan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11656.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for years, we also had students who were selected, the highest students who got to go and visit Nobioka, our sister city, and in return, they came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11667.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean was the first one who got to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11669.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11671.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew Jean when she was a teacher at the Dane, and I knew Jean when she welcomed me into the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11678.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, as she looked around her classroom, her school, as she toured me, and she said, look at this, isn't this great?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11688.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Look how many students we have from all different countries and all different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11695.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry always had a smile across her face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11699.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She was inclusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11701.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11704.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can't really say a bad thing about Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11706.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11709.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11710.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11712.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish everybody knew her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11715.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She has been at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11717.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a tribute to Jean Barry at the school and has been since her death with the sign saying Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11728.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That happened because she was so valued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11731.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when she died, man, it was awfully hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11734.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember how many people were crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11736.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was such a loss in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11739.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm gonna support, that would be my first choice, would be Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11744.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want you to clap or anything else like that because you agree with me, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11749.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, sometimes in here, there's a feeling that it's been divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11756.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry was an educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11757.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I pick an educator as a member of the school committee, I am upholding every educator that we have had in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11764.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Every teacher, every principal, every superintendent, everybody who has committed themselves to education, to me, we can look and we can say to the kids, education is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11776.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that this community recognizes an educator on the name of one of our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11781.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the perspective that I come from and that I bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11786.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the other names are fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11788.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope we utilize them in our community in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11794.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11796.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I take exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11798.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to the person and the commentary that has happened that has said this school committee didn't function about our education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11805.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We only worried about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11808.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to say this to you as someone who has been on the school committee for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11813.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee worked hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11816.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee, yes, we had this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11819.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was at the right time and we could debate that till we were blue in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11823.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't need to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11824.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what we do need to let you know is in the month of March, this school committee had 23 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11831.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier, when we started out, we took Toni Wray, our nurse, and we held her up because she's been such an incredible force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11839.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee, our administrative people, our school committee members, we're not looking for your praise, but to sit here and hear you say you didn't care about our kids is simply wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11852.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I don't say it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11853.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: okay, I cannot live with the feeling of just sort of sitting here and nodding my head and saying, oh, yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11859.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11860.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11861.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We worked damn hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12314.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'm just, I wasn't sure of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12317.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're all making a statement, is that a straw poll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12320.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't want to make a statement, we can do a roll call, but you just need a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12324.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, probably just saying a name probably doesn't give people an understanding of where I was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12329.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So like everyone else, this has been a challenging year, and I'm glad we're here tonight to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12338.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are three great names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12341.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: saw Lewin Topper at our son's baseball game the other day and we had a conversation about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12347.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You might remember that a few months back the school was originally or the school was originally in the mystic a few months back I made a motion to just let's return to the name of the original school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12357.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that did not move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12359.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still think Mystic made the most sense, but now we're at this point and I do think the Mississippi Tech makes the most sense that it is something that is all-encompassing because it is more about geography and that the students are all very supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12380.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do want to say I did not know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12386.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, I did not know Miss Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12389.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't have the opportunity and hearing her sister speak made me wish I had the opportunity to meet her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12396.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I appreciate her husband being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12399.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, my heart goes out to them for someone who's, you've lost someone so young, but I do want to say that I think for the community moving forward, I think the river is something that is, that is connected to all of us here and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12418.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't going to share this story because you never know how people take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12424.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My father<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12427.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He grew up in Ireland, but always driving up Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12429.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I grew up at 350 Fulton Street, and my father always going up the hill, he would say, you know, Mia, long before us, there were Native Americans who walked up Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12438.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't called Fulton Street, obviously, but to Wright's Pond, and that's where they got their water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12442.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as a kid, it never really registered with me that there were people here before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12447.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now it kind of came full circle for me that this is an opportunity to recognize the Native Americans and the tribes that were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12455.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before us, long before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12457.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate all the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12459.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had a lot of great conversations, a lot of great email exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12463.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, I feel like I do have a piece about us that we are moving forward in that we can all work together to make Medford inclusive and welcoming for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12475.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12621.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The appropriate way to do it, Mayor, would be to have us each state, I mean, like, that's the name probably that we would go for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12631.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did receive another, I was distracted only because I saw another letter came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12636.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we closed...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12637.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12638.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12700.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12777.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12957.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a friendly amendment if...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14186.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, who are working and then all of a sudden now there's another I mean, you know, so part of me is saying, it seems like would also be incumbent on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14195.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we might have to speak to Megan fiddler carry about this to also be able to provide some sort of daycare options on those unusual holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14205.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not a majority of the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14207.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, like let's Christmas, people are going to be off, but all of a sudden I'm concerned about these, especially when they're floating holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14216.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so I, I think that has to be now foremost on our mind if we adopt this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14223.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so anyway, just my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14308.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, but you see, one of the other things I have a concern about is if we're and you know, I absolutely understand why we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14318.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if we're elongating the school year, then all of a sudden we're elongating because we're also going to observe Juneteenth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14327.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there's the potential then that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14330.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, because we've elongated now, like this year, it doesn't matter because school is over before Juneteenth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14337.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, it's just, I can't help but be concerned because I know in the years when all of a sudden, and Kathy mentioned school finished, you know, the 28th or 29th, it's awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14349.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's my biggest concern with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14354.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I didn't look, you say that you've worked it out for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14361.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 21, 22, 22, 23, which?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14362.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This won't start until 22, 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14366.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it worked out that year okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14983.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we used to call community participation and say, I just want to bring to your notice that there's a movie night at the Columbus and we'd like you to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15022.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's, you know, I think that's actually newer because we used to do community participation and someone could get up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15030.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, they were always supposed to, the old rule was you were always supposed to inform the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15038.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: superintendent's office on the Wednesday before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15041.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But frankly, that often is difficult for people who just want to get up and say, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15048.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: know so so here um every any presentation that someone wants to do will go through the superintendent's office right is what you're saying for which is a current policy we don't follow people can speak on a community item but they can't get up in community participation and just say anything um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15070.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, sometimes what we always used to just sort of, but the person would say to a committee member, um, uh, I want to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15078.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And usually, um, then we would ask the chair, whether we could, whether it was permissible mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you don't want to do that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15139.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess what I'm trying to do, Paul, is I appreciate what you're trying to say is it's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15146.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also trying to, and part of this is conjecture, trying to say, hey, how are we being realistic because somebody like the PAC would like to come forward and say, hey, we've got a PAC meeting on next Wednesday and we'd really like you to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15172.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In her report, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15175.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I may be trying to, it's late and I may be trying to come up with too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15277.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15279.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you, when passed our attorney, the section on appealing and authority determination,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15295.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent may seek advice from the district council about whether to proceed with the following appeals process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15301.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should the council determine that a presentation cannot proceed, the presenter will be informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15306.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The appeal will be placed in the next scheduled regular meeting of the school committee under the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15310.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to know, usually I would have run something like that by Howard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15323.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to amend the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15325.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion for approval on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16327.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16329.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16331.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't understand the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16334.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where, how the flexibility of the meeting and the superintendent can start the meeting at different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16339.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I truly just think that makes it more complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16342.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that, um, I think we were trying to come up with a standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16348.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We start at 6 30 when it's a regular school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16351.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16354.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm a little mystified how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16358.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also mystified because the report of the superintendent, that's the funny part, because for me, that's always like, to me, that's been, okay, that's the most important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16367.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the meat of the, that's, you know, so it's funny to me, the presentations of public, the resolutions, you know, I'm a little mystified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16381.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It might work and I'm just not seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16386.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, the other thing is at the consent agenda, I think, but I'm not sure, but I'm gonna ask Mr. Murphy this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16394.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that if it had to do with finances, like the approval of payrolls or the approval of bills, those two things have to be roll call votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16405.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16415.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16416.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you'll roll call vote it all as a group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16423.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it'll include all of those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16428.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16430.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16433.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I just don't know, because we've always done those things separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16492.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if someone gives us a donation and it's financial, we have to do a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16505.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've just always done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16506.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was told we had to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16508.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16527.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so you would say this paragraph, consent agenda, and including the approval of payrolls and the approval of bills, that's all okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16543.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we have anything that says no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16557.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can this and our start time of 6.30 work together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16566.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16568.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16584.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I'm saying that we have, that we start the roll call for attendance of members at 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16589.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16591.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the consent agenda, and that's done all before, and the report of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16596.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, to me, that those things can all proceed at 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16603.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and the only thing that you want to make sure that we don't start before seven is the presentations of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16614.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16645.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All I want to understand is what time is the meeting going to start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17022.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17027.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17029.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She stepped out for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17036.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17038.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was six in the affirmative and one stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17044.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, now it's time for your report, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17065.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17069.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17078.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A community participation portion of the agenda will be established which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee to be heard on any item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17088.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17117.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, number eight, number one, superintendent's updates and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18314.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion that we do it on Thursday, June 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18320.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18321.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18572.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18577.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does this include then both breakfast and lunch?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18581.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what is the approximate cost that we should anticipate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18641.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But is it so so Paul, obviously, this is a good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18646.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: good thing that we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18648.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's incumbent on us to understand what the cost and impact will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18674.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have a, look, nobody wants to vote against this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18681.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18682.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly think it's in with my purview to ask a question about what is the financial impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18688.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18690.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18694.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the question is if we're going to move on this, because we've done some other things in our budget, all things that we want to keep,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18702.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, obviously, if there's ESSER funding for next year, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18708.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether, you know, would this come under ESSER funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18713.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask Mr. Murphy if he would know the answer to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18721.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19078.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, did anybody say motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19082.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19208.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, if we vote for this, it just says we're going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19217.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm asking, but what's the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19225.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I don't want to vote against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19228.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19229.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, we do have some families who can afford it, but I understand what you're saying, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19235.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's already three members listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19240.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, just call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19248.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not used to voting on something which I don't understand how we're going to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19259.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we have that meeting next week on the 24th, which is a budget meeting, can we have a report back on this so we know how we're going to fund it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19268.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because what I'm thinking is we've just shown that we're going to be $700,000 approximately, shorter of what we requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19280.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now this is potentially another, shall I say, $750,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19502.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19505.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that explanation, I think it's okay to pass this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=607.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=609.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Superintendent Marisa Edward-Vincent, I think that you continue to do an exceptional job under the most difficult of circumstances this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=619.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At every turn, I think that you've certainly displayed an incredible commitment to your role, to being available to us, to the community, to the kids at every turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=633.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As the four standards are outlined,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=636.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you have met them all and done an exemplary job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=643.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thank you and I look forward to your continued leadership in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=841.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=848.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the meeting that we're going to have to confirm the budget a committee of the whole, or are we going to add a regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=856.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What does it have to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=930.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member McLaughlin, could you repeat it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=931.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We were just trying to figure out the scheduling, so I missed what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=937.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=958.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So no more the week of June 27th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1057.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1058.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that what we're thinking, but if we could just look and determine when we think the special meeting would be, what is the latest that the city council can give us the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1075.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's usually, I know it has to be done by the 30th, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1079.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Their last Tuesday meeting is the 29th of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1083.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So does that mean that we are going to, our special meeting will be held on the 30th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1090.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just in case, I mean, if they have to, if they go all the way to the 29th to confirm the budget, then it would suggest that our special meeting would be on the 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1102.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1105.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really need to set the date so I know what, you know, if we do it the previous week, we might not yet have the budget from the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1115.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1118.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1119.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1120.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So therefore, I make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1122.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that the special meeting be held on Wednesday, June 30th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1125.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1126.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1127.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, is that a date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1139.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we think that the city council might be done sooner so we could do it on Monday the 28th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1241.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The truth of the matter is we never had a final approval meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1244.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What happened was we submitted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1247.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We always understood that the city council has never declined the amount that we submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1255.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is something new that we're doing this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1261.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's difficult because if they go all the way to the end, you know, we can't really, if they haven't voted the budget, how can we accept it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1275.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This really is a question I think Mr. Murphy might have to weigh into since he was the one who suggested, because otherwise I'd say let's do the meeting on Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1282.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1284.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which would be far, far preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1287.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you go to July 1st, it's the beginning of the 4th of July weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1310.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And yeah, so once we get that, I would actually suggest otherwise that we look at Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1316.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's put a hold on Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1376.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'd have to do a leader's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1440.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did want to read, I thought I saw him here earlier, so I thought he might chime in, but I do want to read a letter that we received for the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1451.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, I'm writing to express my utmost appreciation and support for Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1458.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The courage and grace that she has displayed over the past year is truly remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1463.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The city is blessed to have her leading our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1466.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure that the members of this committee feel the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1468.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I look forward to many more years with Dr. Edouard-Vincent at the helm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1472.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully, Sean M. Began, Esquire, Zero Governors Ave, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1478.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1479.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1484.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3216.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's red, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3218.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If it's red, then yep, you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3220.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I received three emails regarding the start time of our school committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3229.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were from Eunice Brown of 48 Greenleaf Ave., Rick Orlando from 13 Winford Way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3238.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and Ron and Janice Martinetti of 126 Lincoln Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3245.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each of the writers asked us to start to resume the original 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3249.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: start date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3251.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, is it allowable for me to just condense these or do I need to read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3258.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if they all are the same subject matter, you can give us a general outline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3262.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the request on all of them is to resume the original 7 PM start date for all our school committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3269.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of this is that now that we're back to chambers for people who want to come up in person, it's easier for people to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3280.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Eunice Brown also asked that any subcommittee meetings also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3285.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: start at this time when a regular meeting does not occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3289.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if one was before a meeting, I think that it sounds like she understands that would be at a different time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3296.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, the people spoke to the fact that they want to be able to participate and that the earlier start times makes it difficult for them to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3310.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is a summation of those three letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3321.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I speak to this for a moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3329.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to explain for people why we also are trying to be deferential to the people who, for employees as well, many of them who start very early in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3349.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3350.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3352.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, actually, okay, she said that she did get an answer from administration, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3357.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Edwards-Vinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4760.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4761.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4763.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I too would like to just add my thanks and appreciation for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4767.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's so exciting each year to get to see what projects the kids are going to take on and it's just so fabulous for our district and just a sense that we're on the cutting edge with this and really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4782.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to ask the superintendent if you would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4785.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: make sure that a letter goes out from the school committee thanking the Cummings Foundation for their extremely generous gift to the CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4792.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5419.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6017.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mayor, I just also want to congratulate and thank our dynamic duo team, Tanya and Alex for their incredible energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6029.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really, when I get to attend the meetings, you're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6034.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6038.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8523.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van de Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8524.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to add my word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8526.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is clearly a very comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8529.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As we were, as you were presenting it, I was looking at all the different things that we've talked about this evening and in our other meetings and sort of thinking about which buckets they would go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8540.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not that some of those things haven't been already been doing, but the laying it out and saying this is our direction certainly makes it very clear to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10168.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10169.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was very, very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10172.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sure that you've, since you've worked in different districts and whatever, and you must be familiar with some of the software that's out there for what you're suggesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10185.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do, can you give us an idea of what, when you say, yes, it's expensive, are we talking 500,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10191.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we talking, you know, what ballpark?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10195.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because this clearly is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10197.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: not only the school side, but the city side as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10200.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know you don't want to be pegged to a number, but, you know, I'm not sure that I know what your big is or your expensive is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10208.716s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just trying to get an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10213.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10312.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: current practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10313.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you shared with perhaps Mr. Murphy what some of those biggest players are that you would suggest we look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12130.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could just give us some specifics, how many members of the team are you envisioning at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12141.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Megan, and then how many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12270.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight, are you asking us to approve the concept without a dollar amount attached?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12334.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I make a motion that we move forward with the family engagement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12342.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13047.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, we are expecting the advisory committee to present on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13053.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought we were then going to vote after their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13061.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If they don't come to completion of their, I mean, I think it depends what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13070.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: message we send back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13072.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're saying to them on Monday, we're going to, we'd like you to present whatever you've got, whatever, whatever, however, whatever slideshow they have, wherever they're at, you know, or, or, or we could be more direct and say, we don't need a 30 minute presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13094.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need, you know, I mean, we want to make sure that there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13099.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: one or two slides about each name, not necessarily eight slides about one and none about the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13107.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I do think that the direction back to the committee is yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13114.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're extending it to June 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13117.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We expect on the 14th that we will hear your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13123.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please at your meetings now go forward with the intent of having at least<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13129.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, a slide about each name, not eight slides about each name, but a slide, you know, something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13154.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that's more the only that, that given that there's limited time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13160.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we'd like a fair amount of slides per.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13162.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, to give us a concise presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13164.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that if, I mean, if they need to set up their meeting so that they're going to speak, you know, half an hour on this name, half an hour on this name, and, you know, provide structure to them so that they don't get bogged down on the slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13273.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I support this very much because as the person now who's charged with reading the letters or the commentary, the question always is, do I have to read word for word?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13284.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What if there's inappropriate language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13286.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What if there is, you know, three letters as there was tonight all on the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13292.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's difficult to understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13296.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate that we might develop some guidelines for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13384.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May, just to give a back story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13387.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we received a $30,000 recycling grant and as part of the grant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13391.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It has to be a school committee approved recycling policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13394.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is a standard policy for the Department of Environmental Protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13397.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I look forward to all supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2750.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Murphy, you and I spent considerable time today discussing the issue that my colleague brought up at the top of this meeting with the transportation for the high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2762.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And really what we come down to, if I'm clear on it, is that no final decision has been made except that you are working towards the fact that the school committee wants to provide transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2772.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One thing I thought about after our discussion was whether students would still be able to buy bus passes if they were so inclined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2821.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2822.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just to follow up, during the course of the discussion, I expressed great concern that the Eastern bus projection that we would be able to go down a bus was a terrific surprise to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2838.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, it is true that we have less students currently than we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2842.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is unclear exactly how many students will be returning to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2846.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that is, I just, I think that we need to keep what our budgeting generous in this area because I believe, I just know from the past that all of a sudden we have requests from the woodwork and it's very, very difficult to take back something that you've given before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2865.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2867.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the bright side, I do wanna mention that there were so many things in this budget which are positives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2872.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, I'll just pick a small one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2875.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the world languages, we are going to introduce French in the sixth grade level and textbooks for that have been provided for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2884.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's also textbooks in the science area, and I didn't go through all of them, but I don't want members of the public to think that there aren't, in fact, major upgrades in many, many areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2899.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, there are some areas which I am a little concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2903.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm gonna go back to my fine arts where earlier I had asked many questions about this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2908.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had been advocating strongly for a supervisor, a director position of fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2916.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After a discussion with the superintendent, it's clear that she's not yet ready to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2922.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I understand that in some ways, in other ways,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2926.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still feel that the area is so critical in that social emotional well-being of life area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2935.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we aren't doing that right now, but I've certainly made it clear that my concerns in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2942.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll be watching that very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2945.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, given that that isn't happening, I was a little surprised not to see some of the smaller requests increase inventory of instruments, including ukuleles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2956.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had asked about the number of violins, being that we're going to be starting both<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2961.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: potentially two grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2964.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And some of those things I don't see funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2967.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to ask about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2969.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also wanted to question, I assume that some of the other things that we talked about for science, I mean, excuse me, for summer enrichment programs are under the TBD sort because that's gonna come from ESSER funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2985.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, could you go back and talk about the smaller bylines and fine arts at them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3147.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see there is a line item restoration of supplies and transportation lines to provide for resumption of normal event participation post pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3155.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I assume that one perhaps is about transportation for the band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3163.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that one is in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3164.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess one of the things is when I talk about and you mentioned ukuleles, but there's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3170.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: part of my real concern was the violin and the orchestra program, that while they're small numbers, and I certainly understand you can say, yes, they'll be covered in the course, that there were some of these that are, you know, really germane to the enjoyment of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3189.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that enjoyment and going to school is, you know, a very important piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3194.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I mentioned them, kind of like the chocolate chips and the pancake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3253.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, one last, just building on a previous issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3258.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It does under, for example, in the mathematics department, it does set aside 35K in, it says, for a week-long, four-hour-a-day math academy, which we had spoken about, certainly, in the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3277.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says COVID mitigation priority, so I'm assuming, again, that means ESSER funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3283.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3395.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3396.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thanks for all the work you've done on the budget, as well as Michelle and the rest of the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5096.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the school committee received a letter this week from some of our CCSR students asking about our user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5105.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this has been something that over the years we've sought to reduce user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5111.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, it's a fairly substantial number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5114.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And perhaps, Mr. Murphy, do you know how much user fees bring in or approximately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5134.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, this is certainly another concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5137.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that we have taken great pains to make sure that students who could not afford user fees were in fact waived, yet the students are bringing it before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5150.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I realized that at this point now we've set our budget number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5155.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're also clearing that there's going to be some level of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5161.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: change yet in the budget as they normally are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5163.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it is something that we should take up again at a school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5168.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly know that for years and years and years, the ideal thought would be that we would waive all user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5176.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's always been a budget impact, just the way the transportation is and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5180.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we can look at it in the future, and again, the students spoke up, I would certainly like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5188.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: hear more from their concerns, because I guess in many ways, I was thinking that we were meeting the needs of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5197.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're not, we need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5205.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5206.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion that we accept the budget and put it forward to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For $68,221,865, Mia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5218.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5287.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tomorrow night, yay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=262.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And earlier, it'd be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=977.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=980.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, first I just want to say thank you for the great presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=984.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see all of the projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=986.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm particularly excited I have to say I think that that new house and you know the what you've talked about with the kids being able to learn how to do the kitchen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=995.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and how to, you know, cut into the drywall, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=999.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1001.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1002.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't wait to see it in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1004.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the outside of the house of the school looks, by the vocational interest, looks so much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1012.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for, thanks for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1481.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1484.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course my phone's ringing at this point, but my question is, I've just seen the phenomenal work that our students are doing at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1495.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm wondering whether there's a way for this project, designing a sign, whether it makes any sense to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1506.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to ask Chad, and I don't know if Chad's still on, you know, is there between our different shops, is this something that, you know, a sign, I know there might be a timeline, so if the desire is expediency, maybe it takes too long, but I just wondered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1545.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From the lighting perspective or from the installation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1551.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious what part of the project was the most challenging to you, Chad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1593.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1595.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you wanna, like, I guess one of the questions is kind of getting a sense from the committee what we think, you mentioned the mayor like number one and four, is it possible to put them up right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1671.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1760.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't like the white background in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1836.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then it says home of the Mustangs on it underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1879.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not lighted, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1881.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we could shine a light on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1904.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know on this one, the things that I think it's, you've got the horse in two different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1910.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I like the Mustang pride over the door, but maybe if, I mean, if we're gonna use this rendition of the horse, then maybe I would do the etching on the window, but have one of the plainer signs over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1926.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I don't understand why we would repeat the horse twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1978.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I'm not wild about this new logo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1982.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I do like, I like, depending, the home of the Mustang's right over the door is, you know, I prefer we stay with our old logo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2033.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I disagree with you, Paul, if I may, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2038.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kool, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2039.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if we were to reconsider naming the high school at some point, that would be when we did a very large project, if we were going to ever go that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2049.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think for this one, the idea was simply to get a sign on at the front signage as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2057.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We see, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2061.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Involving the whole community to make a decision about whether they like this sign or that sign to me is similar to sort of involving the whole community and whether we want this paint or that paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2074.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is in our purview that we can suggest, you know, we might want to involve all our colleagues or the mayor, whatever, or, you know, but to go further than that, I mean, I don't think this is a community issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2086.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is coming up with a good design and getting it up over the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2111.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, we're not renaming the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2114.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're putting a sign with the high school's name on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2127.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we could also say that's a can of worms too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2160.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question will be the cost of what we got as bids surprises me that it's so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2170.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's the issue is to say, hey, we like this kind of, this is kind of what we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2175.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we do it in a less expensive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2180.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can it be done in a less expensive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2183.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I look at the letter on the vocational school, and I think it looks pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2192.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2574.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which one's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2577.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2599.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you do one, two, and three again, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2618.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, wait a minute, where's three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2740.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On this one, we can only vote for one, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3042.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the thing about this then is that it's not showing the blue and white colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3046.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's showing the blue and the color of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3314.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the sign made out of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3405.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at the same time, I think it's worthwhile having a little bit more of a chat, maybe with construction, I mean with carpentry and electrical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3418.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, this is the kind of project we can, what letters were done on the vocational school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3425.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think both, I think, Peter, I think it's a great idea to involve the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3430.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that doing some pictures around the school saying, which one do you like, you know, and it would be fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3436.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know it's late in the year, but I think that would really be the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3441.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think if there is, you know, a way to see if there's any idea more about how to create the sign without spending that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3571.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a question about timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3574.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure we're clear about what the timing should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3581.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we want it in place so it's there for the opening of school in September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3586.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is it more important to cut costs, include the student body, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3599.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, so far what I'm hearing is we want to do a little more exploration and we're not ready to give an okay to a 20,000 plus sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3686.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and with the pricing, the pricing may be just the manufacturing of the sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3692.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if it included installation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3694.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the other question is if it included the electrical work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3699.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't think it did, but I'm not certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3712.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, this is where we really need a company to step up and make a donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3752.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, Kathy, I think it's 6.04 now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3827.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3838.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4515.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, that's a sweet idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4524.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to have us have a horticultural program, but that's a topic for another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5440.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, what do we need now to proceed on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5443.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's our next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5890.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6167.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6171.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6174.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6458.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=100.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=104.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody wanna skip the meeting and go out for a drink?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=111.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, there's Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=113.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Man, that got a smile from a lot of you, so I think I'm onto something here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=119.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's only Monday, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1059.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1061.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the meeting was on 510, present was myself, Paul Rousseau, attended in place of Mia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1071.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1073.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also present was Rachel Perry, Peter Cushing, Suzanne Galussi, Bernardette Riccadeli, Lisa Evangelistic, Joan Bowen, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Christina Lee, Medford Community Media, Bill Giglio,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1087.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and Maureen Lavin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1090.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel Puri discussed health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1094.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She gave us a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1096.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She mentioned that Medford is aligned to national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1100.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: DESE is editing the 1999 frameworks and will put it out for public opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1106.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because of that, that's why we're right now aligning to the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1111.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We use the Michigan model based K to 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1115.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We spoke about this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1117.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at some length later in the meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1121.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the elementary, social-emotional is taught by classroom teachers, which begins in kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1129.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In third grade, discussions about bullying education begins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1134.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fifth grade, we have introduction to puberty given by the nursing department using a Proctor and Gamble curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1149.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are pre and post tests provided to assess student learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1153.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In middle school, the students have half a year of health and half a year in guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1159.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then we talked about some detail about the curriculum in each of the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1167.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, that there are pre and post assignments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1170.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At high school health, it's taught by health teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1172.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, it's half a year of health, half a year of physical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1177.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Freshman year is introduction to health, sophomore year is healthy decision making, junior year is healthy lifestyles, and senior year is transition to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1192.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau asked whether gender identity was covered in grade six to eight, and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1198.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry answered that it was covered briefly in grade six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1202.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: National guidelines on sexuality and gender identity just changed and we're adapting to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1212.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau followed, said that he was concerned it wasn't presented until senior year, but Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1217.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry assured us that it's also presented during the freshman year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1221.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also talked about the right language for consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1224.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1225.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that the students are taught appropriate touch guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1235.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo said, do we ever talk about sex in a positive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that the age of consent is 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1242.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we talk about abstinence to adhere to that guideline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1250.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1251.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham questions about the Michigan model and spoke about her concern that a consumer product video is used to introduce puberty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1264.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there was quite a bit of discussion about this and seeing the hopos that we could see whether there is a better film or introduction that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1277.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's sort of on the table to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1282.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In physical education, in each of the grades, really introduction to basic skills and concepts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1290.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that we talked about the most is what's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1298.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to hire a middle school health teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1302.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need an adaptive PE teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1305.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to provide professional development for sex education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1311.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we need to provide professional development for adaptive physical education for the entire physical education staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1326.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did talk more about the adaptive PE and asked how we're meeting the needs of all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that some students say sub-separate, some go into full class, and we're looking into using something called the flash curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham followed and asked more questions about the Michigan model, and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1355.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry assured us that it's a skills-based model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1358.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remembered from our, when we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1364.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: used it when we approved it, there was a great deal of discussion about it at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1374.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent said the Michigan model is definitely one of the most respected skills-based models.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1381.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We do need to pay attention to the national standards until DESE updates theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1386.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Girls are hitting puberty at younger ages, especially children of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1390.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Research tells us that we need to emphasize healthy eating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1395.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, it was a good evening, and many of the things that we talked about in terms of needs, we've picked up in our budget discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1403.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1818.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1820.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2085.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so Mayor, we did receive a letter from Mr. Giglio in regards to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2093.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could take it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2096.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: later in the agenda when we speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2099.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do you want to hear it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2101.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whatever you think is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2112.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, if we perhaps did it at the forefront of that, it would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3425.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3597.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3598.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5972.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'd just like to thank both of our principals as well as those who presented last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5977.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so great to see some of the creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5980.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The desks that look like cars with the shields just absolutely just got it for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5989.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5990.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there were so many different ideas and creative thinking in those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5995.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, when we're talking sometimes about the issues, it's hard to, you know, understand exactly what's happening in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6003.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then you see that and it's just knocks your socks off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6005.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much to both of you and to all of our principals who've worked so hard this year and to our entire staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6552.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, are we ready to conclude?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6555.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I did get a letter regarding the whole Columbus issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6563.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't read it at the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6568.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is from Mr. Giglio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6570.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know he was on earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6572.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, he's still on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6575.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a kind of funny thing about the letters, which now we have this way that people can submit letters, but they're also on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6585.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, I think I need to read it because it was submitted through the proper channels, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6592.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, dear school committee, with the recent removal of one of the Columbus School renaming committee members due to his social media comments, many Medford residents strongly feel that the process is tainted and flawed due to not only his anti-bias views, but other committee members and their similar social media comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6609.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although this former member no longer sits on the committee, his suggestion that there was widespread cheating as well as his comments made about a particular race and nationality of people who took the time to fill out the response form is absolutely absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6621.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would also like to bring up the disturbing fact that the beginning of the last renaming meeting, a letter was read on behalf of the NAACP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6629.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe, and I could be wrong, that the public was told that there would be no public participation of any kind during these renaming committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6636.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only was the NAACP, who does not sit on the renaming committee letter, but it also mentioned other issues and ideas that were suggested to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6646.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: next on the agenda to be pushed through in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6649.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've obtained and read the letter that the NAACP wrote that was addressed to the mayor of Medford and dated March 12th, 2021, which was before the renaming committee was chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6662.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This leads many people to believe that someone within the school committee or school system had this push through to be read during the meeting on May 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6670.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam mayor and school committee chair, with so many issues that have arisen during this process, which included certain timeline dates,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6676.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: made but not kept by the school committee and with the removal of the renaming committee member along with the NAACP letter that suggests changing other rules and policies the Medford community kindly asks that the Columbus school renaming process please cease and be re-evaluated request this Columbus school renaming process be added to the ballot for the November 2021 election<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6699.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to afford a fair process for all residents to have a say in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6704.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please consider this request respectfully, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6710.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 18 year resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6715.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mayor, I have, no, if I may continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6720.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6721.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I would support if the advisory committee needs more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6727.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would think that we can accommodate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6732.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that I did eavesdrop on the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6736.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw the committee slugging through the weeds of process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6742.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: then I was very appreciative to all of them because that's the kind of hard work, the difficult conversations, the trying to figure out what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6755.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly saw, while I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with every comment that was made, I certainly saw people working with good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6765.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was very appreciative to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6768.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my personal belief is that if the committee has asked us for more time, then absolutely in the interest of them going forward, we should accommodate their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6799.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should hear from other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6851.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6852.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, wait, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6854.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6855.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is June 7th really giving them the time they need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6869.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, the other thing I would just wanted to mention before we do the roll call is we also received a letter from the Columbus Elementary staff, which I know is going to be shared with the committee, the advisory committee at their next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6884.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a letter really suggesting some other alternatives that perhaps weren't as loaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6892.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe I heard Mr. Lister mentioned in a letter back to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6900.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vicki Mello, who sent it on behalf of Columbus teachers, that he was going to read it at their next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6908.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would be very interested in also hearing their opinion on the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6963.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8326.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd actually like to defer to the to miss Cugno and Adam, who so if I could have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8509.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8510.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8511.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8525.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8526.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would support sending this to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8529.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's lots of issues involved, including whether we have the personnel, whether we have the systems in place, perhaps we're identifying an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8539.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I may be sounding kind of old school, but, you know, I have some concerns about parents talking to their kids all throughout the school day because, and I always saw that, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8554.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that certainly if there's a concern around transportation or who's going where, whatever, those are communications that do need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8565.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But also, I think there's a lot of questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8572.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I support it going to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8718.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Kathy, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8788.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so Mayor, I do think it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8792.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My only concern is that we've just sent the advisory committee to make their presentations on the 7th<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8801.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know whether it's more complicated or less complicated for them if all of a sudden we say, oh, well, yeah, we're going to be in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8810.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something I'm a little uncertain about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8814.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8817.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You think you're fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8818.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8819.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So then fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8821.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then I would say that we should return and it should be, you know, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8826.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Luckily, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8827.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank God it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8829.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8830.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9198.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to mention that I do think in the future, and I don't know exactly what the governor's advisory is going to be, but there also is, there is a plus side to sometimes having Zoom meetings, either weather related or whether you members are, you know, so I'm hoping that as we go forward into this next phase, and as we figure out meetings, that we're both returning to chambers, which will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9228.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a delight for many of us, but also that since we've now have this capability of doing meetings by Zoom, that sometimes we might opt to do a subcommittee meeting or something by Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9241.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it'll be interesting as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10102.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=157.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3069.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pick up right at the end about the busing for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3075.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dave, you've presented us with some interesting options, but with quite big differences in pricing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3087.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, as you're building this budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3090.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are you, are you making a recommendation to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3095.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we gonna, I mean, how are you going to factor in the cost into the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dave, let's go back to one of the things you said about the mile radius.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3234.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to tell you, I really don't recall taking any vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I would be, I think it was perfectly understandable that our ridership diminished a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3285.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know in Medford, there's been a history of some students receiving bus service because of concerns about the roads where they live, the safety of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3301.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to just say automatically it's a mile, well, it's never been just automatically a mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, well, part of it is, you know, perceived safety or it's been in place for such a long time, any move to take away will certainly cause an uproar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3354.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it seems like, I hear you on the optimistic level, we're gonna have some space and so we can utilize an existing bus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3364.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That does sound very optimistic to me, Dave, and I am optimistic in general, but- I'm not so ready to balance each other out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3373.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, and at the high end, it's 350, which is a huge chunk of change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3378.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there are some, I'm just trying to say as we, with such a big number, it's hard to understand exactly where you're gonna come down to in terms of what we're putting into the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the same time, and I appreciate the, uh, my colleagues having raised this issue because it is an issue and it is a, uh, a fairness issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3412.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, um, I think clearly we're going to have to have more conversations on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3416.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3417.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I yield to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5187.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5191.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6762.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Initially, right after the election and the concerns around the makeup of the committee, then the pandemic stepped in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6773.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is vital that we determine where we're going to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6777.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to pick a whole new committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6778.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were people who had expressed interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6782.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, we need to establish a committee because I understand Jenny's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6788.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also want to make sure that the building is livable for the kids who are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6793.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think there is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6794.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there is some place in the middle of between absolutely not and doing some of the necessary upgrades to keep the building in a satisfactory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6805.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: shape while students are currently using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6809.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But key to that more than anything is we have to determine what the vision committee is going to be, what we're asking them of, and what the timeline we envision is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6821.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's not the time to start it at the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6823.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6825.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we need to be ready to be focused at the beginning of September and not wait for another school year to go by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6842.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but I think we need to determine, Mayor, we don't need, we can't wait till September to have the discussion about what we're gonna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6850.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, June, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6862.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6865.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw the superintendent's hand waving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7294.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=142.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say, everybody looks so tired already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=150.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=150.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who looks tired?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=151.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=152.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=157.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, one, two, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=162.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's just, I'm tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=321.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're muted, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4122.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4123.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you to everybody for the nice, concise presentations that we had tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4128.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My question in terms of the mathematics department was, but this will probably go filter through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4134.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard us talk about transportation for afterschool programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4138.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we talk about the summer programs, are we envisioning transportation availability for those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4144.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And are we envisioning all in person or might there be a Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4153.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh portion to four kids who can't come into, uh, the program physically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7449.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=8089.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=277.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=279.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=282.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz is on her way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=285.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=288.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia Mustone is, I believe, on her way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=293.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So absent, Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=298.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=300.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1719.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll ask for the preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1722.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question for Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1725.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to do the whole presentation first, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1754.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm okay to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2810.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2811.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I could, if I would suggest that we do questions subject by subject, so that all members can ask questions about a particular subject and then we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2822.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to start since Dr. Chiesa was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2826.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: English language arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2828.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nicole, you referenced that in the future we're going to be looking at our reading program journeys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2834.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, it's been under fire from community members quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2838.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you just define when you say does in the future mean next year we're going to be looking at reading or could you just address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2984.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2986.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks for that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2987.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as part of that question, I just wanna know, the community member who spoke the other day at the school committee meeting also mentioned, and she's mentioned this before multiple times, the use of some teachers, and she didn't clarify whether this was an ongoing problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3005.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know she's suggested it in the past, but they were using picture clues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3010.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you've mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3012.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in our professional development, development on science-based evidence for reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3018.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this little issue about teachers using picture clues, has that kind of now been discussed with the science-based evidence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3080.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just one quick last one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3082.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When will we find out about the GLEAM grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3084.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, thank you all for applying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3102.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's my anticipation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3112.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so we'll keep our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3149.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4630.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a quick one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4631.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Seary, you mentioned Mozilla and Mozilla especially for science, but it sounded like we weren't moving with that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4640.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was unclear why, whether it's just another budget item, expense, how expensive is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4649.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If it seems like it's been so successful in other subject areas, why aren't we putting it forth right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4668.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4670.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't understand that from your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4686.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4687.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it will be included for science as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4690.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4697.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4697.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4698.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5218.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to move on, if we could, to music and oral language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5224.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I had several questions first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5225.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I'm going to take the music part up first, the fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5231.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5232.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my concern is, and we touched upon this in our subcommittee meeting on curriculum, but we've had a whole group of students miss their fourth grade string program and a whole group of students miss their fifth grade string program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5250.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as we all know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5252.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This becomes the feeder programs for the upper level high school band and orchestra, which I think are such vital opportunities for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5261.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm curious about, and I realize this strays slightly from the budget, but there may be budget implications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5267.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we going to, so let's take for the group of next year's fifth graders who missed fourth grade strings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5277.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will the violin become a possible alternative for them in the lineup of beginning instruments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5285.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And will we need more instruments for that reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5289.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm trying to figure out how we're going to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5295.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then that goes into, then we've also missed a whole group of students who missed their first year of instruments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5303.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's crucial for them to have that start if they're going to be in middle school music opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5311.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5448.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bernadette, you've really not answered my question, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5452.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you would, will fifth graders have the opportunity to play violin next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5497.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just wondering if we might need more violins next year, even if the school district is renting them because all of a sudden we have the kids who are moving from third to fourth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5508.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now I'm working on the assumption that next year we are going to at least be able to offer violin because it's not a woodwind, it's not a blowing instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5517.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I'm starting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5519.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm saying, you know, there may be fifth graders who didn't get the opportunity in fourth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5525.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have, we've traditionally provided those instruments for the students for a nominal, I think $25 a year fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5532.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5533.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of which is waived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5534.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: do we have the capacity in terms of number of instruments or do we need to think about what are we going to do in order to expand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5543.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because the goal has to be that in the long run that we're offering kids the opportunity so that we can get over this hump so that we continue our wonderful thriving orchestra which has boasted more than 100 members strong for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5660.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5664.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I can follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5668.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So obviously that's a big concern of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5671.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also how we look at the fifth grade band instrument program as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5680.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still don't know what we don't necessarily know whether we'll be able to be offering all those instruments as far as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5688.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is one area where I'm wondering whether a summer program makes any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5692.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, just to bolster if depending on what the, what the requirements are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5698.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5701.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess it also opens up a bigger question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5704.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, Bernadette, I'd wanna be clear that this is with no reflection on the job you've been doing, but you will know that from all my years on the committee, I've been a proponent of the fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5717.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I'm very mindful and understand that perhaps we're looking at how departmentalized we are, I am concerned that in the fine arts, it's really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5730.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for us to have the specialty of musicians and artists overseeing the department and the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5740.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so while Bernadette has stepped in and done the hard work this year, I've always said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5749.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: hey, I don't want fine arts to become a second fiddle to all the other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5755.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a joke in there, but you know, to all the other departments over time, we need to make sure that our fine arts department is as important as all the other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5767.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I worry about that and I want to know, you know, going forth right now, you're not suggesting a separate director, but the question will be, what will the plan be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5854.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that we budgetarily have plans as well and to make sure that we have enough resources to cover the needs whether it be an instrument or additional teaching staff or whatever to make up for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6467.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I had a question now, if we're ready to move on to world language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6474.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6476.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my question is, Bernadette, you mentioned that there's a $49,000 line item for the introduction of French in grade six, but it didn't look like, was that inclusive of also money for needed textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6551.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay and the second question is really has to do with something you didn't mention but that is we've now no longer have an Italian program at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6564.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really haven't talked too much about what's going to happen there but I'm going to direct the question of saying you know the one thing about the Italian program is it brought in kids horizons in understanding that there are countries that speak a totally different language and use different money and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6581.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, all of the different things that go along with learning about a different language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6589.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering how we are going to incorporate that type of learning into our curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6600.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, again, because we're doing without it, what are we losing and how are we going to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6608.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: make sure that our students have that, you know, without waiting until sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6615.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I've mentioned before, I have a grandson who goes to school in another state, and he's in an intensive French program from kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6622.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He speaks French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6623.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He's in first grade now, and he speaks French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6626.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's amazing, and we're not doing that, but his also understanding of things like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6631.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Time zones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6632.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He's in first grade of time zones and of, you know, money and games and all the other things that learn that take place about learning about another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6641.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm kind of curious, and I realized that maybe it hasn't been thought about too much at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6647.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because it's been a tough year, but I'm wondering about that type of learning and how are we going to incorporate it into our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6655.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the lives of our elementary kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6746.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6851.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Susan, who's going to be teaching the period you just spoke about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6863.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what are we going to call that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6866.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6938.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2519.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2520.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to ask a quick question about the Curtis Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2523.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you tell me what the current population of the school is right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2528.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, were there some students, did all students start coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2535.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do we have any fully remote students at the Curtis Tufts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2559.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So do the Curtis Tufts teachers, are they interacting with those students specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned the program, Boston Recovery Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2591.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In what ways would that differ from, say, a student going to the Curtis Tufts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2619.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it falls within, I mean, I think it's great that we're building something in because certainly one of the biggest problems in this realm is that we don't usually get to build stuff into our budget, it seems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2633.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then all of a sudden somebody moves into the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2636.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think that that's a very positive move, but I just wanted to make the distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2641.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4166.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4167.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First I wanted to mention that it happens to be National Nurses Day today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4172.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Tony I wanted to bring that and say particularly to our all of our nursing staff who's done such a tremendous job this year but to you in particular as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4182.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4185.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really haven't given you all the senior praises yet, but we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4190.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very sad to know that you are retiring, but boy, what a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4196.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony, you certainly pulled out all the stops this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4206.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4207.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to ask you a little bit more about the four additional people you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4213.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: recommend it in terms of tracking the COVID and for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4219.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What exactly, could you expand on the role, I mean that's a, you know, four more nurses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4227.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you speak to it a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4305.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so the difficult part with that is that, you know, please God, when this passes, you know, at which point we've now hired in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4315.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, a team of four people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4317.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we're just sort of saying, you know, I'm trying to figure out how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4345.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4346.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2413.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2414.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question regarding the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2416.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't quite sure whether the request was paraprofessionals at every grade level for every school, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2426.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 20-something paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2429.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you clarify, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2584.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have more questions, but I think we should rotate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I'm listening to this discussion, I can't help but feel the word that Suzanne just used was opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5581.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is here an incredible opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5585.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of it will depend on how we structure it and how creative we can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5592.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in terms of meeting the needs of our kids, but also providing that sort of what Paul suggests, extra outside time, extra time where social and emotional needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5605.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really very interesting just to think about as this conversation has taken a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5611.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, of course, that's gone a little bit far from the budget, but it's been worthwhile to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5616.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Listen into to think about going back to the budget, I just really many of my colleagues asked questions that I already had on my list, but I just wanted to be clear if before you were on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5629.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For example, it happened to be the Columbus School, but there were other things listed, like replacing outdated Chromebooks so that we could maintain the pandemic purchases, or replacement tiles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5642.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I assume that we'll be discussing things like that in the particular, under different parts of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5749.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so and also to follow up and I realized that Principal Kaye has been very detailed here, but she did mention in her pages replacement of walkie talkies for the TLP program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5774.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Chris, I would certainly be concerned that if there were broken equipment for that particular need, that it would not wait for next year, but it would, in fact, we would find a way to do it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5858.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I very much appreciate the coordinated presentation at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5864.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's just some of these details and it's actually quite good to hear that, yes, that's taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5868.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that's taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5869.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5874.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that Principal Kaye has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6837.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia has a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=0.111s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From my fellow school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=42.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Say that again, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=46.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with the three of us here, I'm gonna go ahead and start the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=53.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we could all rise to say the Pledge of Allegiance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=58.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=97.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Read the paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=99.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You would think at this point, we really should have taped it or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=102.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We should have thought about something more clever, but I don't think any of us ever perceived we'd be reading it this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=227.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a long title, Rachel, but Rachel Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=230.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Rachel, I know that you have a presentation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=235.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which area are we going to discuss first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2405.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, hold on a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2407.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2468.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so are there questions at this time on the health education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2473.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the preference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2475.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, what would you prefer to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2477.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you wanna move on or do you wanna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2485.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll watch the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2487.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's 5.41.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2488.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's do this like in 10 minutes or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2492.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so Paul, I see your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2973.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2981.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps you could share it with, with, with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2985.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we could see how they're handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2988.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that something you're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2991.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3011.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Susie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3015.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Susie, I see your hand up, Susanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3064.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3072.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, we have come a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3074.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3081.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3126.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3132.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3135.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3151.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3153.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3159.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3161.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we have time, we can come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3163.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you'd be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3166.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I promise this one will be quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3763.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, I'm going to start off the questioning this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3766.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3772.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3778.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for instance, autistic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3780.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3784.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3789.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3833.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that then an outside curriculum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3842.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's free?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Music to my ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3844.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3845.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3848.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3849.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you send us a link for that so we could see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3851.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3852.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3855.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3965.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3979.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there was much discussion about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3984.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: looking at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3998.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4006.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do want to say that this was something that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4010.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4011.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thoroughly talked about on the school committee level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4315.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4316.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4318.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4320.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, Paul, no, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4325.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4326.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4333.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2335.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Paul Russo is here sitting in her place for as long as he can stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2343.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2346.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2348.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paul, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2701.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually had a question, Maurice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2704.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2705.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can email you on some of the follow-ups, but I'm surprised that you said the demand for AP environmental is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2713.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you poll the kids periodically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2715.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you know it's low?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2741.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm just thinking that a student might even know, how would a student know that it's potential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2782.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so in the interest of time, I'll just say it was very clear that there's substantial textbook needs in a variety of not only the ninth grade biology, but which I was very happy to hear that there was a supplement that would be good for our special populations, but also across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2802.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess unless there's any other thing pressing from Paul or Jenny,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2807.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We should move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2808.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2821.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2822.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for attending, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2824.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2825.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Riccadeli, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2827.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Rocco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4428.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me start off with one Bernadette typically in the music program we start our fifth graders with violin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4436.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you tell us what What ability did we have to start kids on violin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4442.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I can't this year and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4446.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: beginning instruments in the sixth grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4448.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what impact is that going to have on our future band and orchestra programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4487.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So did fifth graders start violins at all or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4559.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in other words, we are hoping that we will be able to provide some opportunities for the kids who missed out, if you would, in the fourth and fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4595.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, because right now you're gonna have in essence two years of beginning strings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4599.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4601.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that we've always kept some instruments aside or some violins for students who can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4609.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think as the committee as a whole has been addressing some of the needs of transportation throughout the city, the rental program becomes a question too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4619.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think I don't expect you to have all the answers for this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4623.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly know that there was Mr. Zigny in the past had done everything he can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4628.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to provide instruments to students who wanted to continue but couldn't necessarily afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4635.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think, you know, I'd really like you to be looking at that question saying, you know, are we able to provide students with the instruments so that we're not losing students who might be talented musicians, but simply because they can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4652.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, next question, just one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4655.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Quaver Ed that you mentioned, is that a series of lessons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4659.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or I went online as you were speaking to take a look, but I just wanted to know what we were using it for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4693.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you think it's $7,000 for K-8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4694.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it is a K-8 program, however,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4736.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4748.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4749.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have some questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4820.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a supplement, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4824.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so a teacher would use it now and then, not every lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4882.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll have to look it up to learn more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5157.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My personal experience has been that it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5162.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: been something that if anybody knew of a student and it was brought to Mr. Zigney's attention, magically it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5172.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's been an informal rather than a formal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5175.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think kids were cut out, but it was never formalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5181.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, okay, it is 529.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5187.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any more questions that you can do in 30 seconds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5191.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that was my last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.509s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to make it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5194.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5196.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5198.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5199.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll let, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5201.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5202.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right under the wire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5204.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny and Superintendent, and if Susie is still on, just if you guys could stay on for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5211.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5212.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, just so we can talk about the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5220.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is Susie still here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5222.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, I'm right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5223.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5224.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Jenny, just while you're here, so at least there's two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=824.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd rather do it the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=830.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=867.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beth Fuller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=926.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In Superintendent, you didn't make my announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1278.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1280.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a comment, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1282.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank everybody who put their name in, and I want to tell you it was very, very difficult to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1289.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of what I was looking at in my, you know, just quickly, was also determining number of men and number of women, and was it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1297.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, did what sort of names to be seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1301.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it was very difficult to decide because there was people wrote passionately, people brought different skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1308.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to include them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1310.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really wanted just to thank the members of the public who took the step and put their names in for our consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1318.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1320.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just because you weren't selected, doesn't mean that you didn't have an awful lot of value to bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1325.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because there were a lot of people left on my list who I would have loved to have included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1474.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=170.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hmm, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=250.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=384.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=386.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=393.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=400.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it might be more engaging for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=405.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=413.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had something like 23 meetings in the in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=418.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=430.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=437.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=663.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=698.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=709.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=717.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=724.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=729.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we move on to the next order of business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=731.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=737.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I don't have it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=741.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=772.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: while you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=781.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=786.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=792.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=794.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Melanie is going to give her report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1074.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have one email submitted by William Giglio from Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1082.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is to your school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1084.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a short but two-part email request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1087.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, with all due respect and after talking with many other Medford families who tune in to watch Medford Public School Committee meetings, we kindly ask that any and all subjects that do not pertain directly to Medford Public Schools, please be refrained from being discussed during the time of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1102.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We as parents tune in each meeting to keep up and stay in touch with what is going on within our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1108.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we do not need updates on news stories that are going on within our nation that do not directly affect this school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1117.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Example, at the last meeting, the news of a 20-year-old man in Minneapolis who was shot by police when trying to flee while being arrested was discussed when this had nothing at all to do with the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1127.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are many other city community meetings and other outlets that have the time and place for these types of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1133.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, I also kindly request that at the beginning of each Medford school committee meeting, when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, that a flag be present behind or in view of at least one committee member during the time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1145.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that meetings are conducted on Zoom and not in city hall chambers where flag is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1150.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3361.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3362.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just this is kind of a housekeeping comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3366.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3374.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3379.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Additionally, and I particularly want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3384.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: highlight this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3392.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'd like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3401.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3413.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3423.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6672.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, let's see, member Rousseau, and then I'd like to get, we do have a hand raised by Leticia Rocha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6679.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6880.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, may I call on Leticia Roca, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6885.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Leticia, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6887.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you unmute yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6894.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7035.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7036.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see the mayor is back, so I'll hand the reins back to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7041.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You need to unmute yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7049.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We were discussing the transportation for high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7061.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Melanie would be next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7063.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7486.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had some questions about, first of all, there's a timeline September 1st for comprehensive lists and current job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7494.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to understand whether that was realistic given all the demands of going in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7504.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just curious about that from central administration, what their reaction to that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7510.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little concerned, I find this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7513.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in many ways pretty confusing and very prescriptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7523.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sort of wondering if there's a way we can simplify it to make it more accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7700.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, let me see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7701.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to say Kathy's had her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8042.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8044.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8046.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also just gonna throw out one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8049.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I just, the terminology, professional staff, what, the rest of our staff is unprofessional?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8058.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There may be no way around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8060.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It may just be the common thing, but I'm just going to mention it to say to me, it just sounds so funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8522.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8155.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, there are two letters that we received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8158.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One is regarding the mathematics curriculum, which makes sense to read just prior to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8165.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Khan's presentation this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8167.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other one is regards to the afterschool program, and it makes sense to read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8172.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The parents specifically asked to read that at the outset of the presentation, as they had questions incorporated in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8180.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could hold those two to them, that makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8190.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, I was doing an undersecretary's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8196.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was like, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8200.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry about that, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8203.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll just let you get over with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8224.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8225.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on March 10, 2021, we had a Curriculum Subcommittee meeting that was to be attended by myself, Member Graham, Member Mustone, the Superintendent, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Chiesa gave a PowerPoint presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8244.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if you recall, at our last school committee meeting, I asked for this to be held because the PowerPoint presentation was not incorporated into the minutes, and now it is incorporated into the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8256.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the meeting, the first thing we reviewed was state expectations, and then we looked at Medford Public Schools, the district curriculum, professional development, and resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8268.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: equity in English language arts and goals and next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8276.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about the early literacy screeners and, again, the district professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8284.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was quite a list that was given and provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8287.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Hill for Literacy, Crafting Minds, Dr. Nadine Gabb, Lexia training, Lexia Core 5 training, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8299.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also talked about the Medford Early Literacy Screener.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8303.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Alexia Rapid is given at the Brooks, McGlynn, and Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8307.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the NWEA Map Growth is given at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8313.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was, of course, some concern about evidence-based instruction and discussion about journeys not being evidence-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8324.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and the bringing in of ECRI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8326.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some parents had concerns that it is not complete enough and are not supportive and evidence-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8336.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also a question by member Graham<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8340.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who spoke to the fact that there had been a request for a handwriting curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8346.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That did not go forward last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8350.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure whether it was only because of COVID or also because of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8357.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something that's still on the docket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8364.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was discussion about the curriculum being more reflective of different cultivating additional programs to support the science of reading, including, but not limited to, ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, Lexia Learning, and NEWS-ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8396.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also, Dr. Chiesa provided for us a list of price points for various different supports and how much they cost the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8413.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one other thing I just wanted to mention, oh, was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8417.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Equity in ELA, there's been the addition of numerous novels and informational texts by diverse authors, creating an inclusive classroom, inclusion and pacing guides,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8429.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and also an edition of News ELA, Exploring Identity and Culture, Mirrors and Windows Collection, A Mile in Our Shoes Collection, and Black Students Matter Collection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8444.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is another curriculum meeting this Wednesday at four o'clock, and we hope that you can join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8492.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the problem is we're covering so much in the meeting as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8496.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that while we touched on, you know, resources being included, we haven't had specific, more in-depth conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8508.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have another meeting this Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8510.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's covering two subject areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8513.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, we're gonna have to go back and I know we had a follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8518.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't thinking it was in the curriculum, Melanie, about the special education resources, but we certainly could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8527.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we talk and we'll figure out how to go forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8710.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8711.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Dr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8715.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at this point, no curriculum has been chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8727.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8731.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we have to hold that question right now, and we'll do a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8737.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, there's Dr. Marisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9425.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9666.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this was a follow-up, a second night of discussion from the strategic plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9672.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we divided it up into elementary, middle, high school and special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9678.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately on this night, there were no special education parents and no high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9682.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we went down to the younger levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9686.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one, a couple of comments that I just, one member said they thought<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9691.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that it was passive rather than active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9694.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that was important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9696.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was some discussion of what's the difference between a mission and a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9700.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And since one of the parents suggested that perhaps as a part of this or the totality, we liked the idea of a short memorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9714.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one parent suggested preparing our students to change the world for the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9719.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that was kind of a neat vision statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9722.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a question of how would we have follow-up and how would that we know parents wanted to make sure that they were part of the follow-up as this was, as we spent more time on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9738.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10161.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Russo, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10168.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in truth, the night that I was there, I was also, I guess, confused because the truth of the matter is that it is the vice chair who's reading those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10177.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10179.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The big question is, so we have to take that piece out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10184.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is whether the secretary believes, and we can ask our current secretary, whether she wants to be put on in the position of every meeting being asked if there's a separate report from the secretary, or whether that is just something a holdover from a prior time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10200.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I do know earlier when member Kreatz held the position, she approached it in a very certain way, which was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10209.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the different folks have different feelings about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10214.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the reason, I just wondered what you thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10719.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, you said there's only- There's two, and one is in relation to the math curriculum, and the other is relation to the afterschool program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10729.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought I might read them at the beginning of each of those sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12311.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12314.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm so I do have a letter from the public regarding the math curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12318.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether I would actually ask Pfizer, whether I should read it at the beginning or at the end of her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12352.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think just because we've...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12355.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the person submitted it appropriately, we should read it very quickly, and then hopefully you'll hit the points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12362.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12363.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That'd be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12365.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12366.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, I have some questions for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12368.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn about the report on the math curriculum and would appreciate if this letter was read then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12373.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, have the programs that the elementary schools can possibly pilot been narrowed yet, or is that part of what the committee is going to decide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12381.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are the programs that are still in consideration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12383.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12384.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the plan for the current middle schoolers for the 21-22 school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12388.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will the seventh or eighth graders have an accelerated class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12391.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or are we planning on definitely choosing one of the high school acceleration options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12396.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins in ninth grade, figure four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12409.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A, how are the enhanced classes different from the regular classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12412.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How much from pre-calculus needs to be pushed into these enhanced classes for students to be ready for calculus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12418.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could these topics be covered in the regular classes for all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12422.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: B, what are the pathways for late bloomers in math to get into the advanced pathway and for students who decide to switch out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12429.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: C, could there be another option where all students take algebra, geometry, algebra two, and then senior year when students have a better idea of what they want to do after graduation, they split into an enhanced calculus or take one of the other math options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12443.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is very focused on the advanced students, but what are we going to do to close the achievement gap, especially from the events of the last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12451.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we close the gap without relying heavily on summer school, excessive afterschool tutoring, excessive homework, or keeping students back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12458.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14496.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We request that I be granted five minutes instead of three during the afterschool topic, agenda 9.4, and that the below questions be read aloud during the meeting prior to our five minutes for this agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14508.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford parents for better after and before school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14512.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have built a network of approximately 40 families who are ready, willing, and eager to be part of identifying and executing solutions related to the afterschool crisis in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14522.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To build the MPS school committee mission round tables to build off of, I'm sorry, held April 5 and 6, we know the current mission statement is changing and we support this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14534.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we would like to ask the following as it relates to the mission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14537.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: calling for MPS to be a partnership of school, family, and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17137.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17139.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17141.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the thing is, first I want to thank Megan and Fiddler Carey and David Murphy and Suzanne Galussi and everybody else who's worked on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17151.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And certainly there are a lot of positive changes in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17157.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17160.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the increased wages hopefully will help in securing people who want to work in the afterschool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17167.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's always been a difficult position to hire because it's for a limited amount of time in sort of an awkward part of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17175.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that I've visited the afterschool on numerous occasions, and I've just been so thrilled with the staff members and their dedication to the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17186.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They clearly take their responsibilities very highly, and I've heard such wonderful feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17194.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said all the positives, the only thing is if I'm looking at this and it was from the first slide with the numbers, we're adding projected 60 spaces, but we've got 144 on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17207.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That means if I understood this correctly, there were still 84 families who are being disenfranchised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17213.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so then the question comes back and saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17216.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great, fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17218.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand you're trying to be realistic in your projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17223.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand there are some issues about space, although Mr. Murphy said it was not space alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17229.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Probably the hiring, I would guess, is one of the most difficult things altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17236.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But how are we going to accommodate the other families who are not accommodated in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17242.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what, what else can we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17244.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wondered and I realized, I absolutely get that there's a whole nother oversight needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17251.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've parents have mentioned that they wanted to be cooperative players I've remembered the days of preschools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17258.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where there were cooperative preschools and parents volunteered maybe to work on a Monday and Wednesday, and then their kids went and other parents took over in other days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17268.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I fully appreciate that's a whole nother level of organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17275.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if hiring is the issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17278.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we're looking still at this gap of 84 families, and I don't know if it's spread throughout the district in particular, that seems to me that's the next challenge and what are we gonna do about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17293.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I say this almost kind of like torn, because I wanna tell you, I very much appreciate the work that's been done and the steps that are positive moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18895.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually have a question on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just have to raise my concern because I've looked at the schedule just to try and get more meetings in with our budget meetings and what we're expecting of our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18910.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, maybe we have to ask, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18914.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Megan to spearhead this sort of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18919.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have to express concern that, you know, I think we had 22 meetings last month and I wanna be as responsive to the parents as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18931.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanna have maybe, you know, is there a way of working committee but a formal school committee meeting to meet with all the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18938.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just doesn't seem like the most effective way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19294.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19296.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I was actually going to suggest the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19298.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, Mike, my initial concern is we need to make sure that we're giving our administrative people space to do the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19308.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this clearly needs to be in the mix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19313.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing about this topic is we've got to, this isn't one where there's opposition or we're at loggerheads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19321.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19323.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We want this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19324.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everyone here, I have no doubt, wants this to happen in a positive way for our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19457.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19459.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I fully support that we want to make sure that we are talking to parents and engaging with parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19467.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whether we need a formalized process right now, I'm just trying to say, you know, I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19478.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, we've got a very active, engaged group of parents who have, you know, clearly been able to make their voices heard and their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19487.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: express their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19489.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, there's nothing, Melanie, you're sure we can vote on your thing, but I don't want to formalize process and say we're going to have this survey and that survey and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19499.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know exactly what it is that you want, that we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19507.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm responding to short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19509.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't trust our staff to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19511.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I trust our staff is going to talk to these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19931.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it was referenced in the minutes that we received tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19939.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was in the elementary meeting on the second night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19943.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I did hear the parents extensively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19946.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I realized that you weren't able to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19949.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that may be why we've got a slightly different perspective than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=13.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, and I'm sitting in for Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=266.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, at least for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=636.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that in terms of the role, it should be done so that the school committee role is called and announced by the mayor and then it should be, then the student rep should be introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=652.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want a differentiation between it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=656.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that you're going to spend more time at some point talking about the role of the student reps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=664.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had some misgivings or concerns about some areas of your conversation only because in my long-term, I will tell you that there are years that you have great student reps and they're there and they're participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=680.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's years where you don't, and there's years where you have very confident kids and years where you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=686.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we just need to be very, very careful about what we're setting up so to make it a true positive learning experience rather than someone on the hot seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=698.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we need to be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=700.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We happen to have had some very strong representatives while you guys have been on the committee, but that's not always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=709.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there were years when, frankly, we didn't have kids who were interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=716.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you don't you don't want to put them in a place of embarrassment either where you're keeping on asking if they're present and they're not or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=723.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just think one we need to I think it's great and we certainly just prior to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=732.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When Dr. Perlow was the head, we had had some discussions because I think Paul, I think you and I had, we had actually gone to a MASC event about student reps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=746.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I talked to many student reps about what their role was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=750.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I came back feeling that we weren't being significant about it, but then that kind of fell through the cracks because we changed, you know, principles and we're starting, we started over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=763.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, that's my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=834.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, cause I haven't really thought about it, but I mean, now when they, now often the mayor will make an announcement as she, when we call the roll, she'll make an announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=848.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's sort of to formalize that so that she'll also announce who's present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=883.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but those two people aren't part of the quorum, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=886.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I was making the- I know, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=900.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't- Dave has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=935.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We took the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=936.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then if the students were present, the mayor announced them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=956.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I think what the problem is, is whether the mayor, what Jenny's saying is she doesn't know whether they're there, and probably Brianna doesn't always know if they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=967.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so by calling their name, you know if they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=971.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1394.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1405.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I don't want to belabor the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1408.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just concerned about making a separation so it was clear for people who didn't know, you know, that they're not voting members or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1416.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're student members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1418.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I think we should go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1615.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1616.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've always seen it as the warmup, but I can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1625.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I've questioned about the report of the secretary because I think it's just something that's been on there forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1633.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I mean, different people have handled it in different ways, but, you know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1646.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that, you know, if you can, I just don't know whether it makes sense if we were looking to take something out, but I'm not the secretary right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1657.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do know that when you're the secretary, I mean, Kathy used to go and she would highlight a particular bill or something, you know, which sometimes was interesting, but, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1669.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, it's not that as secretary you get so many, I mean, it's a rare time that you would get a letter or something that went to you only, except now that we have the school committee, you know, letters, which come under community participation, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1753.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Particularly in the recent times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1757.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, this has been extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1775.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the interesting thing is if the secretary is called on nowadays, he or she should be called on during community participation to say, are there any letters that have been sent in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1790.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in some ways, the secretary's report should move and be part of community participation to highlight the outside letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1804.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that piece sometimes, frankly, the mayor forgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1808.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it would be useful to have, it's a tweak, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2110.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the motion should be that the secretary's report be moved to under community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2130.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, a bullet underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2174.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need you to just in a sentence or two, tell me exactly what you're saying when you say consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2208.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you can do that for minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2213.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that there are certain ones that have to be called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2217.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you have bills and payrolls, I think have to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2223.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to investigate that to find out whether that's true or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2227.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's my, for the ones that we can, I'd certainly be, that would be okay with me, but we need to be clear which ones are which.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2329.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2332.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'll look at it later, but I'd like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2336.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you found one that has it, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2415.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we can move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2417.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2418.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to think about it a little more, but we certainly can move it forward to the main meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2425.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2429.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2432.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2461.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me flip back to... Okay, members of the council and Graham, unfortunately at this point I need to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2474.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, take care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2475.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bye-bye everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3250.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3251.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=159.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to have an initial introduction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3943.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me, I put it in the chat, but I think it said, Medford Public Schools provide safe and equitable learning environments that fosters academic success, personal growth, positive relationships, civic responsibility, adaptability and resiliency for all our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3967.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A lot of our conversation was about, there was nothing wrong with the vision statement as written, but it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3974.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, tended towards to be too encompassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3977.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, a lot of our discussion really was, we really liked one from Boston, Paul, every student, every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3987.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4033.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the one that I read, what we were really talking about is what key phrases came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4040.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we had a discussion about how important the school environment, how it had become clear this year that the school environment was so important in nurturing our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4052.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we talked about equity, and we talked about adaptability and resilience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4056.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we were just trying to incorporate some of those key concepts, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4063.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, the shorter the better in so many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=188.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2105.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I'm gonna ask if you could just skip to the next item of business and take this up last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2111.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm switching back and forth, because I also have community participation letters, and so I'm not quite ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2119.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you could just do some of the other subcommittees first, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2982.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would actually like to table them to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2984.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that Dr. Quilles' report, a link wasn't provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2989.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the discussion will make much more sense with that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2992.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to talk to, we'll figure it out by the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3178.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mayor, we received six communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3181.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is entitled Info Request for Advisory Committee Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3186.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was submitted by Luchita Hiller, 58 Metcalf Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3192.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She says, hi, I am trying to find information on how to apply for the advisory committee in charge of picking the new names to replace existing Columbus school name and how to submit new name nominations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3204.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been looking through the MPS website and could not find anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3207.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you direct me to the right place where this information lives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3211.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3213.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would someone like to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3243.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3244.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the next letters, there's five letters and they're all on the same topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3248.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll read one from the first one that was submitted on this topic was from Sharon Hayes of 69 Ripley Road and then I'll tell you who submitted the other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3259.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, dear superintendent and school committee members, I am writing to you as a parent of two elementary school children who are currently enrolled in the full remote learning at the Roberts and who will remain in remote learning for the rest of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3272.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am very concerned that the students who plan to remain in the remote classes not be subjected to additional changes due to the April 5th shift to full-time in-person learning for the current hybrid students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3284.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The remote teachers have spent the last six plus months working hard to create a classroom community and new daily routines in virtual learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3291.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While both of my boys are struggling with the virtual aspect of virtual learning, they love being a part of the classroom community and seeing the same classmates and teacher every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3301.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as a parent, I know that the classroom routines keep them feeling grounded and secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3305.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If any of these things are changed now with less than a third of the year remaining, if students are regrouped and put with different classmates and or a new teacher, it will cause yet another major disruption in the lives of young children who are still living through an intensely difficult and traumatizing event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3322.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please do not make changes to the remote learning classrooms between now and the end of the school year."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3328.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That sentiment was shared and we received a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3334.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: email from Arshia Amina of 37 Ashland Street, from Shanine Pelequin, she did not give an address, of Michelle Ciccolo of 28 Douglas Road, of Wynette Vo,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3359.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, also no address and of Claire Flaherty of Marshall Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3365.716s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, all of those, these centers, uh, echoed the same concerns of the first letter, um, about remote learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3443.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask, Superintendent, are you going to address this this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4990.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4991.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I would raise my hand also to express my concerns that it seems like we've made a commitment to our remote kids and it doesn't seem fair to all of a sudden put them in a predicament, though I hear what you're telling us, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5009.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think probably right now it makes most sense to turn to the community members who've had their hands raised for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8563.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8564.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8566.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we vote on this one first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8607.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8609.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the programs that we spoke about this evening are also the programs that have taken place before, so it's great to have an update about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8616.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But are we anticipating any further remedial type programs for students during the summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8623.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was kind of curious about where we're going to go with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9228.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9229.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a rain date for graduation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10147.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes I just I want to it's I've received another email and I did note that the speaker was was here I see him but it's from Matthew Page Lieberman of 15 Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10163.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: His question is I'd like to know what options are available to a MHS senior<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10171.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I recently met who told me of her struggles to get the assistance she requires for her mental health from the school system after attempts have failed with her guidance Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10182.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can answer a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10250.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10252.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So can I direct the sender to tell the student to contact you directly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10263.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and that you will make sure, or superintendent, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10408.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10815.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1167.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Juliette Boone, Moderatoring): Jenny has her hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2030.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to suggest that it would be a better use of our time rather than guessing at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2036.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know I've had very detailed conversations about the air compressors with John McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2041.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If he was here, he would be answering every one of our questions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2046.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and I remember when they were replaced, um, the same thing with the other, uh, the details along the fire extinguishers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2053.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it might be that we want to, um, hold the details and ask John for an update on the specifically on the, um, uh, what you're referring to the document you're referring to Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2127.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we expect John to be joining us later in the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3040.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I need to understand what we need to decide tonight, because clearly there's a much larger<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3049.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: question, which is to say, how much money are we going to put into the current Medford High School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3056.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If in fact, at some future time, we envision a rebuilding or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3064.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I need to know just tonight, what decision we need to make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3071.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was this brought to us because we're trying to make a decision about whether we're gonna expend the money for the bathrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3258.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, are we discussing the superintendent's contract now, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=111.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=837.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=840.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had sort of a question, comment, a little bit different than where you're going right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=844.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But just in terms of thinking about our kids, I know that last week I had occasion to have to go down to Mass General Hospital to see a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=854.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, my reaction was there was all these people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=858.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they all doing there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=860.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was used to being in spaces that were very distant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=865.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And all of a sudden there were lots of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=867.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody's wearing masks and all that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=869.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, I'm kind of wondering about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=871.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Stacey kind of veered in when you mentioned, you know, all the kids who've been on remote all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=877.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But as we are looking for kids coming back into school who have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=882.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: given this message over and over again to keep their distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=887.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now we're potentially going down and you know from 6 feet to 3 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=893.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I know how I reacted I and I've talked to other people and they've had similar reactions so what about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1015.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering about the short term the kids who are coming back in, you know, in the coming weeks to all of a sudden, you know, four day or five day learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1025.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, what we're thinking about and helping them adjust to this, more bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1031.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'm really thinking about the kids who are prone to anxiety already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1053.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we talking to teachers at all about, you know, having them be watching for this kind of anxiety?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1076.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4859.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to say to Dr. Cushing, it probably, so right now it sounds like the RFP is being prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4868.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is something that I think the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should also hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4896.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just saying, Peter, it's such exciting news now that it's back on the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4902.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at some point, think that the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4908.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: also be updated when you get the chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=985.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to mention that one of the real key issues about the after school program is personnel, is getting enough people to cover the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=997.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's been a real challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1000.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So even if you look at enrollment, whatever, obviously the answer is to expand it, but expansion has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1007.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tough because of the lack of people who want to apply for the relatively low paying jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1017.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's also, it's not just the low pay, it's also the hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1022.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many of our teachers have already worked a full day, so they're not particularly interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1026.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've tried students coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1028.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We certainly bring in a certain amount of high school students, but they need to be overseen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1034.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So absolutely what we would like is to be able to expand it to accommodate every family who needs it, because that's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1041.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1269.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like we will need to be having a separate committee of the whole meeting for this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1275.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1437.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Special Ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1438.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1439.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1440.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want me to get the list and take a look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1441.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We used to have support services, and it fell under support services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1447.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, you want to just read off the titles, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1470.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we used to have one that was called support services and when they were shrunk to a more manageable level, that is not as clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1484.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you could argue it in any number of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1488.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said committee of the whole partly because I think that all the members will be interested in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1743.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask Dave if he could give us an idea of what time you had in mind for these dates, the 4-27, 4-28, 4-29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we should limit our name only to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=25.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=33.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=40.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=44.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=53.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=57.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=68.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do think your suggestion hits that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=72.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=84.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=91.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=97.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to mention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=101.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: right now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=119.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=132.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I did read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=134.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=141.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=147.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: opposed to the name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=150.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, and we know that there are far more letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=155.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=160.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=173.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=201.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=208.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=214.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you can, that's a personal request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=216.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't want to, that's your option, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=222.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=230.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I'll just give it as report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=232.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They'll be all put into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=235.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=241.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm at the it's at the will of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=638.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=639.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=653.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I asked Peter if he would put them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=656.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think they're similar to yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=658.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There may be one difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=662.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=667.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=678.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: us all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=683.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=684.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=688.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the six key talking points really covers the most important things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=695.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=703.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=714.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Ruseau and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=726.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=732.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=739.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=746.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One is how is the advisory committee chosen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=749.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=759.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and not particularly complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=763.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=766.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=772.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Four, what is the charge to the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=775.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are we asking them to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=777.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Five is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=780.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=787.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=796.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's just, I put that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=799.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1548.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to address one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1551.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many people are speaking about all the different things that the school committee faces, and that's absolutely true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1558.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a lot of work ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1561.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, and part of this is being brought about, well, you need more time to hear us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1569.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have heard strongly from the community, and I myself have gone and spoken to some members who are very anti the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1578.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's very, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1580.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But to say you don't have enough time, well, frankly, we're a pretty dedicated bunch all across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1587.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't think that once we get through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1591.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the process and work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1593.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there will be some things that I speak to, like removing one piece, we'll get to it later, off of a school committee onto a committee of the whole instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1605.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, so I do, and the other thing which I think is key for me to say as the longest serving school committee member is, and when this first came up, I spoke to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1617.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, when this first came up, I will tell you, and I've said to other people, I wasn't happy with the process, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1625.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at that first meeting, I felt confident in that, yes, I did feel there was a reason to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1634.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You must remember that there was in light of a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1638.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a spring of great reckoning and understanding of what was going on in our world and the racism that exists that we all saw with our own eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1651.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is a context to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1654.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But 20 years ago, when we built the new schools, I can absolutely tell you that there was a discussion in the committee, in the Building the Future Committee of which I was part, about the naming of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1670.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at that time, we were well aware that there were people who would much prefer it not to be the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1681.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've kicked myself sometimes because I let that go, partially in deference to a community member who I had great respect for and who didn't want it to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1693.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's been a recurring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1698.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, maybe you haven't heard it, but I have over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1704.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard it, I've had discussions down at the Columbus School with parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1708.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not that this just popped up and there's been, it's not been part of our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1715.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It has been particularly for parents whose children attend the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1721.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that certainly isn't to say that everybody agrees, but it's certainly been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1737.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the time has to do with the timeline that she's suggesting is part of the discussion that we'll have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1746.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're sort of talking two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1749.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I too, after I worked out my resolution, believes that it would be great to have more time, which is to say a number of weeks more to come to the conclusion of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1762.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've built in and will talk to my committee about saying that I think that once we put the advisory council together and they begin their work, that they are the ones who will need to be able to say to us, hey, we need eight more weeks, or we need 12 more weeks, or we think this has to be the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1781.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's a discussion that as we work out the particulars of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1785.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is the reality of it is, and we just have to say this, and it's just blunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1791.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When people are saying they haven't been heard, we have heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1796.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But unfortunately, we don't necessarily agree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1800.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are not agreeing to change, to not change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1806.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So people keep on saying, you haven't heard us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1809.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we are hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1811.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And quite honestly, I mean, I had some great discussions and I was really moved at one point by one person who told me what Columbus Day meant in his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1822.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I listened and I heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1824.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard other people say we're erasing history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1827.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're still going to teach our kids about Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1830.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is part of our education strands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1835.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like we're just saying, and Columbus had, hey, there were some things that were good about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1841.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What we're saying is, is he, is this name the one we want to represent this educational facility in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1852.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1855.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the committee, six members plus the mayor, this community voted for us to do what we think is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1862.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not an easy job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1864.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is painful, it is tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1866.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my committee members said to me, you know, Paulette, the problem with you is you wanna make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1871.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's absolutely true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1873.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't wanna piss anybody off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1875.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And no matter what I do, I'm going to make some people unhappy in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1880.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am being true to myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1883.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've worked, spent hours and hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1885.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, those hours were not conflicting with the other work that I do, talking to administration, saying, hey, can we work on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1891.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hey, what about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1892.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I've got lots of hours in my day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1896.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But trying to say, how does this process work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1900.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is there a way that the process can help bring this community together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1905.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I listened on Monday when Mr. McKillop suggested that we start all over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1912.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for a while back, I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1915.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was wondering about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1917.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I came, thought deeply and said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1920.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, we have had lots of opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1924.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: People in Medford are aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1926.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I walked my dog this afternoon with someone I didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1929.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's not particularly involved at all in the politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1933.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I said, wow, I've got a heavy meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1935.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, oh yeah, it's the Columbus naming issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1938.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: People know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1940.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3233.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When member Rousseau created the form, he had on his form that someone applying for the advisory council committee, sorry, would also be submitting a name on the same form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3247.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have severed the forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3249.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have you apply for the advisory committee or you're putting in a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3254.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody who is a member of the advisory committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3257.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on the advisory committee can certainly put in a name, but they're two different forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3262.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It'll just be more easy to organize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3266.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's the list of names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3267.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's the list who's applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3270.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other difference in our form is I also asked on the one for the advisory committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3278.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked when they were available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3281.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's a line that says, you know, can you tell us when you're available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3285.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I think we need to know if people are only available one day a week, that might not be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3293.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If they're only available between four and six on Tuesdays,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3297.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that may be difficult, and so that's why I asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3301.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is when I wrote mine, I put a statement in it as opposed to a question, and member Rousseau knows about this, a statement saying that if people needed interpretation services or computers, whatever, that that would be supplied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3321.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a statement rather than asking them if they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3324.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's just makes it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3351.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask the question differently, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3354.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Instead of adding it on Member Ruseau's, could we just use mine instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3360.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I've already written it all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3362.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And since Member Ruseau submitted the other one, I'd like to hear if he's, you know, these are my suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3371.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would just be easier unless there's a lot of controversy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3471.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So instead of working from either resolution, can we work from the list of questions that either you or I put forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3478.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because that then is going to, we can, one of those is addressed in that list of what I said were the key questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3488.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so if we if we worked from the key questions, then we would be, then we would have the discussion about each of our different approaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6722.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so you know, on this, as this differs from Paul's in just two ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6729.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I added the sentence about, are you related to the name you submitted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6734.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also asked that each name be submitted on a different form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6742.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Otherwise, mine and Paul's are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6791.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I forgot to add that, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6793.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7179.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On mine, I have a separate paragraph devoted to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7184.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, the original intent was to have a very lengthy process with students being involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7190.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The time frame makes it shorter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7193.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and certainly will not be as we intended when the original motion was drawn up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7203.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is a piece that's dedicated to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7268.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I think that there was a difference in Paul and mine about the date that the applications were due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7276.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of it is that there's a vacation week built in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7280.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So he had them due on the Friday of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7287.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So which, Paul, if I recall, originally it was April 26th, 24th, 23rd, right on yours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7293.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7297.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I pushed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7302.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the Friday of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7305.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's usually the day when we're then getting our packets of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7311.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I gave more time, less time to apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7316.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have it done on Friday, April 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7320.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which does cut off time, but it's because of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7324.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that our office staff had enough time to collect all the applications, to collect the names, and to prepare them to give them to us as appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7337.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was the reason why Paul and I had a different time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7343.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to be clear on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7349.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: April 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7350.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in essence, people have four weeks to apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7361.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7365.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, it just had to do with the vacation week issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7388.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could, I just didn't know who was gonna be, since it's vacation week, who was gonna be in the office and they need to be collated and sent out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7398.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you could, but just realize whatever office staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7403.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is in the superintendent's office or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7416.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7448.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mayor, Paul and I, and this is one of those key talking points that I mentioned to you earlier, we have a big difference between us on the process of what happens to the name submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7465.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have them all going, if we receive 50, I have all 50 going immediately to the advisory committee once it's formed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7476.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul has a process where we wheedle them down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7481.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What happens is we would, at our school committee meeting on April 26, which is what he designated, and Paul, if you wanna speak to this, because I'm speaking for you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7492.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But he had it that the school committee would wheedle down the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7498.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's say we got 100, we would each pick four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7501.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And he has a fairly involved process where they're weighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7504.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I found that confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7506.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that the whole intent of the advisory committee was, in fact, to vet the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7512.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not feel that I could receive the names on a Friday, April 23, and in our Monday meeting, April 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7520.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: be willing or able to then only send to the committee my top four choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7528.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very significant difference on how we approach this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7668.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7670.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or we can set ourselves up for failure by receiving, if you're a number, Paul, of 300 on Friday afternoon, and expecting me without, I don't have any time to vet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7683.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And on so what basis am I going from 300 to four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7687.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7688.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reason you have the advisory committee is to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7691.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, part of it will be when they will go through and, you know, the first ones, they'll, you know, but that's not, if you're having us do that initial work selection without establishing what criteria we're using, it's a crapshoot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7714.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it undermines the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7863.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So can you use mine, my wording since I worked it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8480.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, um, so in my mind we're not erasing history we're changing a name to what might be a more appropriate name in this day and age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8490.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus will still be taught, like you said he was a famous navigator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8495.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's much history there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8497.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's to be appreciated in its totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8501.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is part of the Massachusetts strands of education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8505.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's both fourth and then again in middle school where students discuss Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8511.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not in any way a shape to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8515.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: remove Columbus from the curriculum or not to teach it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8519.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is a question of saying, what name do we want to put on this building that will embrace and bring our community together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8532.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, Columbus is very divisive, as you can see in this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9020.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau had that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9143.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, I think that's problematical Melanie, because so many people have already felt that they haven't had the opportunity to speak to now say that this may take us another three hours to work through the whole document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9156.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think the way the mayor's been feeding them in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9159.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As time-consuming as it is and how sometimes questions are being asked that we will answer, I think we just have to be short and say, we'll get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9170.509s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think you might make a tough situation even more difficult if you shut down any ability to talk while the meeting is proceeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9188.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: how some people might perceive it, Melanie, and I know you're always open to hearing from her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9330.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10850.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Nadia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10852.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question for me is, and I've said this all along, is there no one else that we could honor from the Italian community that might in fact bring a great deal of pride<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10872.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand people have very different feelings about Columbus, but part of the issue is, is there any way to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10884.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are saying we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10888.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand, and I think a lot of this meeting is because we want everybody to speak, but again, part of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10896.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the need at some point is to say, is there anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10900.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10901.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're trying to say, if you want a voice in this, apply to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10907.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're working out the nuts and bolts so that, and certainly all the work I did on the resolution was to make sure that no one person could slant the committee in such a way that a final name was predetermined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10925.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so that's just a, you know, that's part of what I was looking at is to make sure the process was clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10933.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand you don't like the back process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10935.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that it's painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10937.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10938.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But going forward, how can we make sure that we are doing the best job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10943.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I encourage you to please apply for the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11344.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11347.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to mention that Ron Giovino has had his hand up for a long time, but he doesn't have one of the regular little hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11356.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to make sure he's on your list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11421.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ron, what's your address?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11661.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think people should also only have one last chance to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11666.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we've allowed ample opportunity for people to, you know, and many people have spoken several times and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11676.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that we've been more than generous with time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11680.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's people who haven't spoken, they should get a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11685.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we're getting tired and the commentary is dissolving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11713.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the questions is I've seen principal K here and some level of question was around the Columbus participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11724.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if we should,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11729.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11731.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul and I do have the Columbus participation in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11736.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it is part of the bigger question of who's going to be on the advisory council, membership on the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11745.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps, you know, when you have multiple devices and then they close on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11755.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This one's Paul's, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11758.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, would that be acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11762.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, can I talk about that for a minute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11766.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11767.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11768.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I have a paragraph about participation by the Columbus School staff and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11773.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's a separate paragraph says in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11781.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11789.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Additionally, student input is highly desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11792.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11804.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The goal of both staff and student input is to come up with three to five names to submit for consideration to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11813.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The names will be submitted by April 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11816.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11818.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to the principal, there's only four weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11824.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had originally envisioned a much greater, longer period where we were gonna get student education and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11834.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, in recognition of that, I'm saying, oh my gosh, you know, principal, I don't know what you're going to be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11842.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't, I understand to me, it's not, this is one of the problems with a very tight timeline, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11849.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not giving a great opportunity for student input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11856.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Furthermore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11859.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11866.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I have, or appointed by the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11868.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know which way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11869.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted committee input and I wanted the principal's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11915.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: overall intent, Columbus participation, the overall intent was that we originally said we wanted some student participation, and we were recognizing that the Columbus family if you would, including staff members should have some role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11939.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau will speak to this, but he identified six members as being on the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11945.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that was a lot to ask for six members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11950.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm suggesting that the school have an internal process, however way they want to do it, to collect names that they want to submit, hopefully with some student input, but I don't know if the time allows, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11962.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and that there would be three members from the Columbus community, and that is the staff, okay, that would serve on the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11974.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they would be elected either by their peers or appointed by the principal, depending on what we decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11982.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11996.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, but that was less than the six people that Member Ruseau suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12138.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, can I just, one thing, Paul, I just don't know, and when Kathy can, Principal Kaye can advise us on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12150.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't know with teachers being at the end of the school year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12154.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and it's such a busy time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12155.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A part of it was I was trying to lessen the obligation, even though I totally understand they may be fully invested or want to be invested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12165.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is part, you know, this is why I've said from the outset, oh my gosh, I've got a problem with the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12171.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12172.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not being able to achieve some of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12175.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12295.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12302.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, Principal Kaye, what I really want to be is respectful to the time, the limitations of time that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12311.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that there was some place where your school was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12316.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally understand completely that there may, you know, doing a big school project just doesn't necessarily make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12325.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: unfortunately, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12328.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you thought that, you know, if it was making everybody aware that they could submit names from your school and making, you know, that maybe would be what's really possible right at this point, making forms available, letting kids know, you know, whatever, that might be just, you know, what's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12351.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the, do you think that, so originally I think it was that you and, you know, there were five members all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12361.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I suspect strongly there'll be some interest so that you'll be able to have staff members who will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12369.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12391.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you see those though as members of the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12759.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dr. Kaye?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12760.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12761.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you saying that it would be better for the school not to submit names specifically from the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12789.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so if you look at the paragraph that I wrote, which is on the screen, if we take away in the first large paragraph, if we take away the last sentence, the goal of both the staff and student input is to come up with three to five names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12807.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we just take that out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12810.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, remove that, then you have in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school, the school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues oh um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12825.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, okay, that doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12865.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12866.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my next sentence is, additionally, student input is highly desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12871.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12880.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that would work for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12881.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the last sentence to that paragraph is further the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers or appointed by the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12892.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have a question mark there because I don't know which is better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12895.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether you prefer to say that you'll appoint them or whether you say, oh yeah, doing a vote is the better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12913.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12914.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll take about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12928.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, again, that's what I'm kind of suggesting to working through from what I heard Jenny say and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12933.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, does that meet your?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12989.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think there should be more than the three representatives, or do you think that's a realistic number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13025.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So why don't we just put the principal and as well as two to four staff members, and we can come back to that piece after we figure out the other members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13035.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13047.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we can revisit it if it's too large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13109.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can take off the CCC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13113.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I use that only because it was an easy way for students to be elected by their peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13119.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's why I limited it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13122.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also because I know that they're a service organization interested in community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13131.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I'm just throwing out some of these things by saying there is having a high school student rep on any committee that we have is, I think, an appropriate thing to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13143.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm absolutely fine with however people want to amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13203.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: slot that we want to may take a lot more time than, I mean, maybe there's a lot more interest than... So Mayor, that's why I designated the CCSR because they have, you know, meetings and they have, you know, it's just organizationally, it's a really easy way that kids can get together and vote and say who's from Columbus, who's interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13390.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham, while they're trying to figure that out, bullet one and two essentially are the same and need to be condensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13691.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, why don't we put, let's work through each of the lines and then figure out how many it comes up to, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13699.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The number one said the up to four names are, so it says the two names selected from the Columbus School and Principal Kathy Kay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13712.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we had put the up to four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13718.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: individuals selected from the, it should say up to four individuals, not names, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13727.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for doing this, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13729.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13742.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on number two, it says each school committee member will select a member of the advisory committee from the valid applications received and will state the names publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13754.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the event that an application is selected by more than one school committee member, the members will continue to name applicants until a total of seven advisory committee members have been named.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13763.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now that was a member Ruseau had done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13767.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He had suggested that every school committee select two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13771.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That put together a committee of 14 already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13775.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was concerned about the overall size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13778.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The process is the same that we each name<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13781.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, so we can look once we sort of figure out the total number of people, we can decide whether it should be one person or two people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13794.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thought to any thought to allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14036.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14040.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, I have two different committee members who have very different feelings about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14052.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One wants each of us to pick two, and one wants everything to be done by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14061.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was looking for a middle road because I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14067.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The and to me the middle road and was do three by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14072.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there was some totally random piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14075.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and And then do have each of the committee members pick one To be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14084.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very open to whatever the majority of the committee wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14088.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not stuck on any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14089.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14091.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: explain where I was coming from and knowing Kathy had already said to me, I think everybody should be by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14097.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I knew what Paul said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14099.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was trying to bring everything together to a middle place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14103.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally believe that when it says select, if we decide that part of that selection should be by lottery, I'm not uncomfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14112.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But clearly I didn't say we should select the whole committee to try and bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14123.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14124.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, can you go along with any piece of the, can you go along with three lotteries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14156.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I'm looking to bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14158.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14163.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14479.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How does the administration feel about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14802.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess, yeah, I need, I need you to say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14806.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I'm troubled because I think that we as school committee members do, um, uh, have the ability to pick a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14815.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we'll pick a person that will each have a criteria, um, that will not be the same, um, you know, uh, necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14825.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, but that's why there's seven of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14828.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14880.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what if we don't like the committee that the superintendent or her designee comes up with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14885.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14904.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm open to hearing my colleagues, if everybody thinks that's gonna work, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14912.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy, how do you feel about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14966.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess we just have to ask a superintendent, is that something which is comfortable for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15443.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you can just go ahead and do that, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15445.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't need a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16699.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the answer simply is by statute,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16703.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The naming of school buildings belongs to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16707.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The responsibility belongs to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16710.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17113.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think it's inappropriate to single out a school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17118.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I think it's appropriate not to let that comment continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17706.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't you go say the individual selected from the Columbus School and then parentheses say up to four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17714.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Principal Kathy Kay and the one MHA student will be announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17919.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17923.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would say the individuals, and instead of saying up to four, let's say up to three selected from the Columbus School staff, Principal Kathy Kaye, so that's four from the Columbus School,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17938.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: one Medford High School student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17940.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're saying that we're each gonna pick two, so we're up to five and two would be, 14 would be 19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17948.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then the chair would be number 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17953.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the member from the historical commission is ex officio non-voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17962.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have 20 voting members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17964.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the question is whether we're gonna have those three selected by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17970.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was in direct response to Kathy's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17976.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18359.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, you've already got, you've got five from number one, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18365.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've got up to, up to, okay, up to three, four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18370.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Five, so you've got five people in number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18373.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we each pick two, that's four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18379.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18398.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18568.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so you, so the chair would be chosen by the mayor before the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18592.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18646.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18647.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I would say chair or co-chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18653.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I just, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18657.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However you wanna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18668.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was giving the responsibility to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18674.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could say that the person that she picks, since we're each picking two, that one of her picks will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18682.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for the chair or co-chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18693.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily, in terms of the voting, it doesn't necessarily matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18709.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So part of the question is we're also asking whether they're gonna<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18712.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, when we get to the process of how many names they're gonna give us, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18727.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18762.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the only problem with that, I mean, it definitely works, but who's organizing that first meeting then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18768.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's sending out the notices?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18772.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what the problem is if you have the committee pick their own, if you have the advisory committee pick their own leadership, it starts it all out and how long does it take to get to that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18869.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18872.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18873.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the reason why I originally said the mayor will appoint was because I wanted the mayor to do some legwork in advance of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18880.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this to search out people who would be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18886.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that she would know who the chair was gonna be rather than leaving it up to who applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18893.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I needed, I'm thinking when we had advisory committees before, for example, for building the schools, the mayor sought out people to be chairs and appointed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18910.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will, by the way, tell you that this committee is larger than the building the future committees were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18922.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody's amused by that, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18970.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we need, are we keeping in the three additional names by lottery, just?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18976.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18977.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18993.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and the chair is a voting member, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18997.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18998.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the historical person, I was really hoping, I put it in your lap, Mayor, because I just thought that you would be a good point person for reaching out to the historical society and asking, we're going to need help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19014.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The advisory committee is going to need help looking into the history of some of the people that are suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19045.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And potentially, since they're non-voting members, it could be more than one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19105.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul had that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19107.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not have it in mine, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19109.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You could add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19117.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's too big, but that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19180.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to look at this again in light of our other discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19191.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So change up to four, up to three staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19198.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19242.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that, yeah, I think we have to be really realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19304.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, this is just the work of the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19307.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19309.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19312.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, for number two, I think it's important that there, it's very possible that there will be people who are not aware of the letters that we've received and the depth of angst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19328.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for that reason, I wanted them to have access in a file to the letters so they could understand what kind of letters we've read, we've gotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19341.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they don't have to read them, but I just want to say that they have access to them so they can understand what the discussion has been so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19358.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, does anybody object to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, how about number three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19380.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, now there's a crucial point here, and this is one of the key talking points that I mentioned right at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19392.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two different ways we could go about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19395.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul suggested that the advisory council go all the way down to the single last name, they give a presentation, and the school committee votes to confirm it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19408.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, he had that all done on the same night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19413.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I say that the advisory committee gives the school committee three names and the school committee then at a subsequent meeting, I don't think it should happen at the same meeting, that we pick one of the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19433.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The arguments pro and against are, if we have the advisory committee pick the final name and then we just rubber stamp it, in many ways I feel like we're giving up our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19447.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I realize that others will have a different opinion about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19451.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a clear, we have to make a decision about how we're gonna proceed on that particular point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19592.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Paul, if you put it in those terms, I think that we have the responsibility to pick from three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19599.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would suggest that it would be OK with me if the advisory committee weighted them or numbered them or chose not to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19608.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We gave it to those equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19610.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if you put it in those terms, then I don't see how we can choose not to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19795.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so my concern when you get down to two names is that it becomes polarizing again, right off the bat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19803.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I love the idea of involving the kids and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19808.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a time factor for all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19812.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I really would suggest that we might even have the kids go from three names to two names, or we're adding another process here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19822.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but that's why you don't pick two names is because you have one Italian American and one black American, and there you are with your polarization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19832.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I said three, up to three, I said up to three, somewhere along the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20198.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it should be, we're chosen since there's gonna be more than one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20204.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're chosen, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20205.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20229.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20230.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20231.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm really concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20232.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there's a whole lot of me which thinks that this work ought to happen in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20239.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and a temporary name should be given to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20241.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, I guess the way that I would put is maybe put another line, if the advisory committee concludes or if a majority of the advisory committee concludes that they cannot complete this work in the timeframe specified, that they come before the school committee or that they communicate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20268.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this to the school committee with a suggested new timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20273.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20280.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, that would take care of the concern that I personally have that it's too much work and too little time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20427.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought we just talked about that but then we did withdraw right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21155.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's ludicrous to say that we can't change the date of the original motion to say that you know that if they need more time we'll give them another month and they can the Columbus can stay the Columbus for another month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21171.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21173.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As many have said, we're during a pandemic, all the other timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21177.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you actually go back and read the minutes, and there is probably a problem with the minutes, but it doesn't reference the whole, it just says the name of the Columbus will change, and it doesn't put the date on what we actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21188.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I went back and read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21189.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the intent was clear, but I'm just saying, Paul, to hang your hat on and saying, you know, that's your personal thing that it has to change on July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21199.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21200.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's nothing in the world that says it can't change on August 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21206.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21207.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's just nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21208.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, if you want to avoid the temporary date, I mean, somewhere along the line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21216.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've been working really well together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21218.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got different opinions about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21220.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, frankly, I'd like to say December 1st, because I think December 1st would be much more of a process of bringing kids in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21228.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there's a rush here, which is still really uncomfortable, but I need to ask you to move off that, oh my God, the world is gonna end on July 1st if we don't change the name of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21721.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21764.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21766.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that we just for an extra month, it would be called Columbus for an extra month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if that is so unacceptable to my colleagues, then I would strongly vote for changing it to the South Medford Elementary School and not leaving it as an open, because I don't want that to become the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21785.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, to me, it seems silly to have an interim name for just one month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21825.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll choose the temporary name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21859.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, that they have to give us a recommendation on July 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21864.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21875.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you say after that we will pick a name you're opening a whole new kettle of fish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21898.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is, the final date is July 31st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21903.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what if they just don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21911.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if that happens- Three recommendations to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21956.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that then in the off chance the school committee will, the school will be called the South Medford Elementary School until a name is decided upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22042.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody planning on going on summer vacation this summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22309.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also haven't covered the first part of this, page one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22335.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should finish this sentence after July 31st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22559.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, so, um, I of course think this works just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22577.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So mine is a little different from Paul's Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22580.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I made yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22581.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I made it shorter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22583.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22584.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22586.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I added the most significant thing is a charge to the advisory committee where it says, I don't know how that just happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22606.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The way that we charge is the advisory committee with the task of vetting names submitted for consideration and weighing the relative strength of submissions against a criteria they will develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22617.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The criteria will include but not be limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22625.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22634.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Furthermore, the advisory committee is charged with narrowing the field of names to three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22641.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at that point where it says these final names, and it says either, whatever, take out that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22656.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So take out number B. The final exams will be presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22670.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Jenny, also the subset of A. Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22717.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there is one difference, or at least one that I remember explicitly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22723.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau, you had that the names of Medford schools were named after an individual and we want to continue that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22731.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do not specify that also because not all the schools were named after an individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22735.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also because maybe I almost anticipated that someone might<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22742.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: put in the name Mystic and I didn't want to not include that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22746.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I've not defined that and I think that for me, I'd rather have it open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22768.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't, because when you say Medford, Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22784.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I interpreted it differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22797.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously- That's not true, and it hasn't always been true in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22807.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I feel like- Does Mystic count as a connection to Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22810.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22811.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22812.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22813.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just seeing it just as only, but it does mean that nobody can put in Da Vinci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22822.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22824.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I kind of like Da Vinci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22827.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everything's named after him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22832.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Galileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22835.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Galileo, are you sure you just, you know, if we just now put it, then we can see what they come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22867.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, in the charge, I wrote that the committee will come up with what they're measuring names against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22877.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the measurements is the connection to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22881.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22885.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22908.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22914.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22915.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This really comes to my discussion with Rick Orlando, who co-chaired the Building the Future Committee when we built the new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22923.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He said the first thing that was really important is for the committee to come up with the criteria that they're going to measure their decisions against so that they've got some agreed standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22935.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And he said that was really probably the most important thing that they did in making it flow so easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22940.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought that was important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=0.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll read this, our normal paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1865.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm gonna ask Maureen if you could keep it pretty short, because we need to get to the end of the presentation and then reflect back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1872.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Maureen, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2647.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Kayes, can I interrupt for just one second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2649.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you be clear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2654.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that you would be recommending, at which point would you be recommending a new reading program date-wise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2663.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that in next spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2729.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would every school have a pilot program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2766.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, and the goal would be to adopt the program K to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2772.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2773.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I mean, I certainly understand that as a parent who might have a, you know, second grader, they're counting and saying, oh, that's not gonna be made it, you know, for two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2785.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2786.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm walking back a little bit and say, well, there'll be something tried in your school, but that's always the very hard part as our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2793.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as we look at rollouts for new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2939.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2940.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, do you want to continue on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2944.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3349.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3352.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first thing I'm going to ask you is for clarification, just so is the LexiaCorp V at 39,000, is that then would be a recurring yearly cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3366.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And last year- Correct, that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3369.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Last year it came out of the CARES money and-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3374.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3386.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they give it to you once for free because, and then they hope you get 40,000 plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3410.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3411.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I'm not saying we don't need it, and we certainly want the best for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3418.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just in terms of planning and knowing that that's a cost, it's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3427.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to, first if, Suzanne?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3503.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I see Jenny has her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3507.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, unmute, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4179.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, I'd like to just ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4182.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know earlier this week, was it this week or last week, you had a meeting with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4192.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it was last week with the mayor and a group of parents who are very concerned about dyslexia in our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4199.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just tell us, just kind of sum up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4206.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the sense of what we're doing and what their concerns are going forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4214.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think that the proposal is meeting the issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4220.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will our new pick be comprehensive for this dyslexic issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4283.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4581.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4583.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4584.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4586.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4589.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If not, I would entertain a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4596.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4598.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4608.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4611.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4615.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4615.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're on at 545 again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4617.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4620.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Peter, is Peter still on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4623.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4624.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, I need to talk to you for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4627.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So everybody else goodbye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4628.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4630.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bye bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4637.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold on one second, because we are still recording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4641.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just give me one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5691.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, so this is a very extensive, it was an extensive meeting, so I'm going to condense the minutes for the purpose of just sort of summarizing the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5702.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had two presentations that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5704.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first was from Molly Leighton, director of our technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5709.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She spoke to the curriculum and what's covered in each of the grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5715.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She also spoke to questions like, what are her future goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5722.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She wants to expand the library makerspace, expansion of student tech help desks, bring girls who code club<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5731.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford Public Schools and build course pathways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5735.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Full-time librarians in all schools with certified school librarian tech integration leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5742.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She did note that the department is light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5746.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of that, of course, is due to the tragic death of a staff member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5756.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that she also spoke of about was that computer skills, it's not just the computer classes, but also embedding skills within the curriculum across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5773.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not a standalone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5777.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So example, writing on the computer, for example, using a slideshow to present a science project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5783.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tech teachers had to teach proficiently with keyboards for MCAS, use it throughout the day, and now extremely important that everyone has a Chromebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5792.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So member Graham asked about a new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden said, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5799.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this year and last year, we have supported staff and students how to use Google Classrooms, emails, online research tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5807.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of those things will continue to evolve depending on needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5811.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: More a skill set than a set curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden talked about the influx of tech funding, which of course was a positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5826.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I asked about how do we support our classroom teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5829.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we doing enough to support our teachers in areas they don't feel comfortable with Google Classroom, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden responded that library and tech teachers work hand in hand with classmates, teachers reinforcing and assisting when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5850.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, she went back and talked about the library staff is stretched thin and this of course has ramifications for what they can accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5861.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would sum that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5866.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked about the other things that we need as a committee to be aware of for budget requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5872.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, the ordered Chrome tables for kindergarten finally arrived, as did the document cameras for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5879.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those were very delayed in arriving, but they're finally here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5883.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Instructional labs will need upgrading for coding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5887.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We would look to build in a replacement budget for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5893.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, the next presentation was by Dr. Riccadeli, who spoke to us about the world language curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5902.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Much of this discussion really focused on the middle school level and whether French should be added as an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5913.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a great deal of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5915.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think one of the points which,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5917.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw some level of where it wasn't fully decided as Dr. Riccadeli was suggesting that it would start off with grade six next year to offer French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5931.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She suggested that we have staff who's already able to speak French, but I know that there was also expressed by member Graham, any interest in having that extended at least into grade seven and possibly grade eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5949.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We adjourned at 530.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6705.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I always think that we had a discussion about sort of two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6710.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was the front entrance and doing that with a sign and nice, as our community member presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6720.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other was the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6725.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: looking into a banner that might go along the whole front of the building, just to be, add a little bit more sparkle, if you would, a little bit more, you know, interest in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6739.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think right now we were getting to the point where it was just final, this is what we would do, but because there were cost concerns, like how much is a banner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6749.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the, you know, from my point of view, I was definitely interested in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6753.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: making the front of the school clear, clear cut, name, nice, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6760.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if the banner is a not too expensive way of also bringing some excitement to the building, I think we should look into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6772.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to get a price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6773.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just to get a price, just to have an understanding of what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7006.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, there were four altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7008.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one I'm going to read has to do with MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7013.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was submitted by Eileen Manziel of 42 Winter Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7017.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, question, what are the new dates for MCAS testing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7021.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are parents still able to opt out their child children if they so choose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7026.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Eileen Manziel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7156.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Galusi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7158.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Next email, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7161.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there are three more emails regarding the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7167.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, do you wish me to read them now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7185.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7189.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what your preference is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7190.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7192.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and I'll keep on checking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7194.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8456.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8457.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8459.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I do need to let you know that we received a letter on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8463.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can hold it until the presentation, if that would be preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10547.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just, these were just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10550.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really, really liked seeing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12318.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12320.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12321.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please let me know if my audio starts going bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12323.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noted tonight we've had more audio problems than usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12327.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12328.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am reading, received a letter to the school committee account from a parent, Adrianne Preby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12337.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to paraphrase it since many of the things were answered, but I think it's important for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12342.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you to hear her viewpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12344.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She says, my name is Adrienne Preby of 61 Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12348.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I sent this to school administrators but did not receive a reply, so I'm sending it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12353.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The decision to take away a family's choice in switching back and forth from hybrid to remote as they feel is safest for them due to the ever-shifting nature of COVID case counts as a clear breach of trust of families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12365.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How exactly do you intend to enforce this policy after March 18th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12370.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She does ask whether we have considered asking a waiver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12374.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think most importantly, though, the thing I want to mention is she says, additionally, all communications about this new policy only add that families will be able to remain fully remote as an afterthought, barely emphasizing this crucial fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12391.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she feels that this is trying to pressure families into choosing the in-person learning model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12396.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not certain, I don't, I know what exactly, you know, whether that was the last thing said or the first, but I just wanna make it clear that to parents that they can choose the remote model and we're anticipating that they could stay in the remote model to the end of this year, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12419.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12476.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I really think that what she's saying is that because maybe in our communication, she saw the emphasis on yes, you can stay fully remote as maybe not front and center at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12551.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just relaying that the parent feels that this change is not something she's happy with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12557.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she did not feel that it was emphasized that she could stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12561.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12563.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a point of- Her words, not mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13074.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, um, uh, I think this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13080.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, I'd like to be able to wave them all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13083.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the financial impact and how are we going to cover the loss?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13145.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13150.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to approve the recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13450.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first, I do want to, we held off some letters from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13456.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I do want to comment on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13458.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, before I read those, I'm just going to say, I understood the purposes of putting the, that member Rousseau told me was that his purpose was to send his resolution to the committee of the whole on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13471.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I submitted mine as well, so that it would go to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13476.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Resolutions that are put forth just to explain to our viewers are to work out, hammer out a procedure for an advisory council and also a timeline for the renaming of the Columbus School, which was voted on back in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13497.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are very lengthy because there are many important issues in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13504.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13505.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my intent was that it was not going to be discussed line by line tonight, but that I wanted everybody to get a chance to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13514.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have great concerns about the timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13517.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mentioned that tonight, but I'm sure we'll be talking about that on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13522.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, we received some letters regarding the Columbus issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13530.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to, the first one received was from Betsy Lister and long time resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13547.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought I saw Betsy on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13548.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She actually did not put her address on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13552.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is Betsy on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13558.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She is a long time, four decades, Medford resident, a business owner in town for over 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13575.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Vidikul, how many emails do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13579.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's three now, but another one on a different topic has come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13586.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, to all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13588.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've been a long time, four decades, Medford resident, business owner in town for over 28 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13593.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a past president of what was known as the Salem Street Business Association for three years, a past board member of Temple Shalom here in the city, and my son went to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13603.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The direction I see the city going in is one that will hold terrible consequences for the children and grandchildren of future generations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13610.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13611.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This Marxist-communistic leftist agenda that's being forced down the throats of parents and children is heinous, contains so much hatred and racial divide, it's out and outright despicable and has no business in the city, never mind the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13627.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why on earth are children not being taught the important things that will get them through life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13631.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why are they being indoctrinated into a narrative that's full of hate and divides people by color and social status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13637.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why are they being taught about BLM and Antifa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13641.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why not teach them our history as it happens so that they will know not to repeat it in the future to be learning from the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13647.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All men are created equal, says the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13651.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what we should be taught in school, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13654.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not divide by skin color or ethnic background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13656.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are all children and children love unless they are taught otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13660.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And teaching hatred in school has no business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13664.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: being there at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13665.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Teach the children they are all equal and to love one another and their neighbors, not to put a line of division between themselves and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13673.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm disgusted with the new rev, that and they all need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13676.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, I'm thinking the entire school committee needs to be dissolved immediately because it's harming the children by dividing the community unnecessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13684.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13685.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I doubt that the majority of Medford parents want their children brought up with Marxist beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13690.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We already know that academia consists of 98% liberals and the rest conservatives, so that should be addressed as well so that children's minds are not poisoned any further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13699.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very long letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13703.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, that was my own comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13705.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Recently, I heard an audio clip of an eighth grade class with their teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13708.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He asked them if they knew who Helen Keller was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13711.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The response ranged from a man and a German spy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13714.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Only one child in the entire classroom said, oh, that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13718.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that blind person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13719.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, she's not referring to a Medford classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13723.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The teacher then required if any of the children knew who Hitler was and they were clueless, no idea, and couldn't respond at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13730.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Imagine not knowing who Hitler was in the eighth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13733.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And finally, he asked, do you know what D-Day is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13736.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the answer was a rapper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13739.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Think about that for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13740.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are our kids being taught?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13742.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Items of importance or a leftist Marxist agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13745.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not a perfect person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13747.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've sinned in my life and I have enough sense to know what I'm seeing being pushed through in Medford schools is just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13753.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And although I'm not a Christian, I believe that most parents would agree that what's being taught in the Medford school system doesn't go along with their Christian or Judaic values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13761.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seems the leftist took God out of the schools to shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13766.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as for the Columbus School renaming goes, there's no reason at all to change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13770.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know Andrea Bocelli is quite the performer, but he means nothing to me at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13774.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nor do I think who he is makes any sense to plaster his name on an educational building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13778.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not Disney, nor is it Hollywood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13780.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the name Columbus has served the school very well for decades upon decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13784.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For all of his sins, he's the reason most of us are here for crying out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13787.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the senseless and waste our time and poses a distraction to the real issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13792.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's being taught to the children in the direction that the city is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13796.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have elected a mayor who has turned her back on the people who elected her and chooses to do her personal bidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13805.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13807.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, there's a level of, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13815.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Take a knee for BLM, but do not support your own police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13818.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13819.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many want to see this divide that's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13821.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I doubt not the majority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13822.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hell, if I'm wrong, let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13824.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was the support the police rally, and when you have children screaming, blank the police, and creating a scene and spewing hatred everywhere, it was disgusting, and everybody was shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13835.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: These were schoolchildren telling us to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13838.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: yeah, and ourselves and the police and worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13840.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I got hit off the head with a sign by a teenager who teaches these kids this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13846.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Common sense has left the city and needs to be brought back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13850.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we don't teach our true history as it was, the kids will go back thinking D-Day is a rapper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13855.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Stop destroying the city's monuments and institutions by bringing a divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13859.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rather instead, take a step back and start trying to love one another and want better for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13864.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And stop this absolute nonsense and pay attention to what the kids are being taught and worry about their future as opposed to the name of the building of where they get their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13873.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sign me more than mad in Medford that it's come to this juncture, Betsy Lister.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13902.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it says, dear May Lungo current school committee members and superintendent Edouard-Vincent, as concerned citizens of Medford, Massachusetts, we submit the documentation to support our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13913.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The name of the Columbus school should remain unchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13916.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We strongly believe in the proposed name, believe the proposed name change is unnecessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13922.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This packet includes several components, this cover letter, a hard copy of the petition description that was circulated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13931.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: online and hard copy petitions that have been signed by current and former Medford residents who oppose the name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13956.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Regarding the handwritten sheets of petitions collected, in some case, the signer signed for him or herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13961.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In other cases, written permission was received to sign for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13969.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One petition site that we use required that we email the URL to the results to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14015.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A decision of this magnitude should have been advertised far and wide across all media platforms and far in advance of a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14027.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is unconscionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14028.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are deeply disappointed that any steps taken to move forward on this matter are considered ethnically biased, disrespectful, and thoughtless, insulting multiple generations of Italian-Americans who grew up, lived in, attended, and supported and contributed to the Columbus School as well as the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14047.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For Italian Americans, this school name has and will always be a source of pride and history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14093.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be a gross abdication of responsibility to the children of Medford to spend time right now on the renaming of a school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14132.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14133.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was submitted by Brenna Christensen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14152.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I write to you today to request a name change to Columbus Memorial Park<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14165.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So she's recommending that we change the name of the Columbus School to the Crystal Campbell School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14172.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Crystal Campbell was a Medford native, a victim of the Boston Marathon bombings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14177.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She was an active member in our Mustang community and was in the band along with the softball team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14201.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: During the two-day tournament, us Mustangs competed against Boricua, Swampscott, and Arlington Catholic High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14207.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We actively fundraised during the tournament and throughout our season to donate to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14221.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although this tournament may only be two days out of the year, during our entire season, we wear her name on our jersey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14228.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we wear it with immense pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14235.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only is the Columbus Park field home to our high school Mustang softball team, we share this field with our youth softball program and baseball as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14243.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We meet our forever friends, learn sportsmanship along with the importance of responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14248.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But for all of that, we make memories that will last a lifetime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14261.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's continue the pride we feel when we wear Campbell on our jerseys and with a positive change to our city, the city we all love and with gratitude get to call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kind regards, Brenda Christensen, 80 Fern Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14275.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So excuse me, she may be asking just for the fields to carry the name and we would do that under a separate consideration, but we might forward her email to the advisory council anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14310.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, can I just, there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting from 4 to 5.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14314.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think originally people thought this meeting, our Committee of the Whole was going to be at 5.30, so just to repeat, it starts at 5.45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14322.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15015.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so the one thing I just want to say is that the resolution that I'm sending to the Committee of the Whole talks about timeline as does Member Ruseau's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15033.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is quite separate from and different from discussing the key issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15038.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've already made a decision that the school would be renamed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15041.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that there are very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15044.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: feelings about this and I certainly understand that there are people who are very angry about the process that was used right at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15053.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of the timing and us concentrating on what we need to, it was my intent after spending a great deal of time working out the potential for the advisory council to discuss the timeline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15071.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the committee at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15073.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To do so tonight without having reviewed the resolutions just simply won't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15080.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It'll be random.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15081.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So while I appreciate hearing from my former colleague, the intent was to send the resolution to the subcommittee to discuss timelines and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15723.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I referenced this earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15726.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I very much in good faith went through the process of looking in detail with thanks to my colleague who I used his as a basis to work through all of the issues that I think the advisory council has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15744.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's going to be on the advisory council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15746.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are they going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15748.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How are they going to report it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15750.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's going to pick the names, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15753.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15755.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern is having done that exercise is while in it, I kept the dates except for one week of that Paul had originally put in his, I don't think it's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15772.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't think there's enough time to have a good reflective process, a thorough process for the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15785.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not saying that we should overturn our decision about Columbus, which I know many in the community would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15793.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, the most important thing is to try and figure a path forward, which brings us unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15800.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier this evening, we heard those voices of our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15804.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I was listening to the voices of our kids, I was thinking about this discussion that we were gonna have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15811.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which has been feeling such division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15816.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in our kids, we hear the hope and the desire for unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15823.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the advisory council needs time to do its job well and not rushed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15830.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I've gotten older, I have more and more of appreciation for that word reflection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15836.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, getting a chance to think about what we're doing and what name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15843.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have put in mind a chance for a public hearing, not to debate the issue of Columbus, but to look at the new names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15854.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All along, I've been hopeful that we could come up with something that would honor our Italian heritage in this community, but also bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15865.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not gonna do that fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15866.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a slam dunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15869.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there's much pain with the thought of even prolonging the process a minute longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15875.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that I don't really want it to go through this for month after month, but I am very, very concerned that in our short term, we do have a lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15887.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My feeling is, and again, we can go through, I think going through the process of looking at the process outlined for the advisory council is instructive in terms of saying, whoa, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15899.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we gonna set this advisory council together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15901.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that it is really a strong and works to bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15910.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, that's my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15911.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I expected to have this discussion on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=237.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=244.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so you know, you can ask either member to do that as secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=329.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You just might mention the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=778.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=780.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The mayor has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=782.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=783.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you'd let her go first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=808.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=809.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just, Kathy, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=813.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To be clear then, is the money for this generator, has it already been appropriated or has it not been appropriated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=838.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, while this generator has not been operationable, we're just running off of one generator?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=846.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other generator is what I understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=889.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John, the other day when I went up to attend the Haitian dance class, which was really fun, it was so hot in the gym.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=901.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that have something to do with the generator or that's just a completely different issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=992.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, but the generator, and Kathy, there was actually two bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=996.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were two different bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=998.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was for about 120 something, and the other one was for about 58, if I recall, that you sent out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1005.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is it the combination of those two bills that you're saying we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1011.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So 180, roughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1020.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's 128 plus 58, I think, right, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1022.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1023.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I mean, so we're talking, you know, 130 plus 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1027.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In a budget which is going to be tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1041.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now am I hearing that this is an emergency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1046.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, to get through next year, is that what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1054.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was this in our former capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1086.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying is we need to come up with roughly 200K to get this generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1547.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1554.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion, Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1556.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1557.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1559.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1560.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1561.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1795.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not this time around, but last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1853.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1953.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): So Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1954.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1955.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While you work on that one of the questions you had up is an important one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1959.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): And HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): ADA compliant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1964.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): Can can vehicle still drive on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1967.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2049.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Kathy Mayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2052.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I know that for ADA, it's, I think if I recall, it's one inch per foot or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2059.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a very prescribed amount that the rise happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2063.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very gradual rise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2066.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there enough room to, and if you think about, you know, the actual ramp that's there, you know, it goes back and forth in order to accommodate that very gentle slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2080.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Looking at the front of the school at the ramp that we're talking about, which I express great concerns about the safety of on many occasions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2090.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But is there enough rise to make it into an ADA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2093.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there enough room to create the rise, that gentle slope to make it into ADA compliant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2102.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I would, I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2167.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2398.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cha-ching, cha-ching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2757.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2758.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2760.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead, Mr. Antiquity just wants to chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2763.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2768.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, the concern I have is, you know, as soon as we start just the discussion around the ADA compliance, it does get very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2779.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the question now is, you know, again, that vision committee hasn't gotten off the ground yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2786.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2788.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to, we all agree that some level of upgrade would be nice just to make it look better right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2796.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've brought a safety concern with the current configuration saying, look, do we put a handrail in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2806.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can a truck still use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2808.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I understand it's not ADA compliant, that particular ramp, but we've always used the other ramp<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2817.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If, you know, right now, I think that there's a question of, I mean, we just have to be mindful of the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2822.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, there was another drawing you shared with us today, just with the Mustang and welcome Mustangs, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2829.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, you know, I'm really, of course, I would love it to be officially ADA compliant throughout every ramp, but I'm just wondering whether we really have the money to go down that route right now and how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2846.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: do we want to invest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2849.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I loved Klaus's drawings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2851.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I absolutely loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2852.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that obviously is, you know, just gets you excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2856.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is a trade-off between how much we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2860.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm kind of on the fence about that right now when I think about what financial picture we face in the very short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2952.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dave has his hand up, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3110.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3112.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was another photo that you shared with us, and it had the picture of the horse and blue columns on the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3123.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was really a cosmetic upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3129.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had seen that picture when you sent it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3133.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that did not look like that was part of a very large or structural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3140.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't part of a structural upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3142.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was part of a cosmetic upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3145.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered, that was the first time that I remember seeing that particular photo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3150.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, don't remember that being as part of Klaus's, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3154.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So can you-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3232.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just so that you know what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandeku?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3945.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3946.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to make a motion that we ask central administration to explore the costs by talking to Mr. Fallon and other people who might have some expertise in this area to how much it would be to pursue the concept of Mr. Dunovan, which we see as it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3970.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's not a whole redo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3972.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm getting off here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3973.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I should just make that, you know, but how much that would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3977.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, I'd like to also ask that we explore the idea of the banner in the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3983.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see them as mutually, you know, one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3987.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think both have great potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3990.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really love marking the door with a little bit more excitement, and I love having a canvas, especially if we have our students input<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3997.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: into what sort of things we might include on that, how to make it bright.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4002.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd love to know what the costs are associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4006.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Peter, if you would, you might give direction to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4010.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To make my resolution more compact, that we explore the costs of the front entranceway and possibly a banner for the front side of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4035.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4823.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=923.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, you're done, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=925.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=927.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just have to say that this is really an outstanding review for a new superintendent, or a still newish superintendent, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=939.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That not one of the numbers is lower than a three, and most of them are 3.5 or higher is just truly remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=951.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, the overall picture that we see here is of a very strong performance by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=960.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For the sake of the audience, I just want to mention that it's a numbers we were reading was a score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=966.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: each of the committee members rated the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=970.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was the lowest rating that she could receive in an area and four was the highest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=976.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could differentiate by doing a 3.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=980.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're seeing is that in all areas, the superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=986.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: had a very strong showing where not only the majority of the committee, but the whole committee thought that she was doing work of three or higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=998.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Remembering 4.0 is the very highest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1003.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we saw the breakdown of the sheets in some areas, people gave her fours completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1010.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, we did it a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1014.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the future, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking through each of the areas with my fellow committee members, just so that we're all sure that we're rating the particular item in the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1028.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, really, congratulations, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1031.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say this is a very, very strong showing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1034.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that when you opened it up today, we must have seen that that smile must have lit up your office for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1248.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1251.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We always did them in public or we did a, you know, spoke about our evaluations in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1260.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then they were given to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1264.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would assume that it's just a public,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1266.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, paper, which is available to the public, but I don't know how we want to post it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2033.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we probably should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2035.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2041.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2042.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because it's a committee of the whole, not a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2045.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yes, usually we would move something from the committee of the whole to the regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2160.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2189.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Tom, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=7.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5015.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5894.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You didn't call my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6015.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6016.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6018.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Through you, through the chair,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6022.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank the committee for laying this out and Paul for the work you were doing on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6028.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's an excellent working document to have at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6034.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing I wasn't certain if I saw, and I could be terribly wrong, but I didn't see super, I saw goals, but superintendent's evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6117.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw district goals, but I didn't see any specificity around self-evaluation or, you know, that that would be part of what the school committee can expect on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6181.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we receive, if I may, we receive from the superintendent her, and we need to expect to receive the self-evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6194.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6198.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so that's, again, and I'm thinking as if I were a new member looking at this, that if it was put on that, oh yeah, one of the things I'm gonna get is the superintendent's evaluation, and that's gonna start the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6212.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in my mind, I think it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6216.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, I understand the committee deliberated it a long time, but that was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6221.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, the other, I think you did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6239.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6241.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6567.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are no emails today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6568.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do want to mention that there is a curriculum subcommittee from 4 to 5.30 this Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6575.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to be going back to what was on the agenda for a meeting that was canceled, had to do with our world language program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6587.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and also technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8154.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess to that point, is the orchestra playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8279.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10074.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10077.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley for her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10079.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was curious, Alicia, could you send this to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10085.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because there was a lot in it and a few things I'd really like to go back and take a look at more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10091.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, appreciate the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10093.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please send it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10629.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, well, Mr. Murphy just referenced this, but, and he said it would not necessarily solve the problem, but I can't, in order to address some of my colleagues' concerns, can we post where we have our budget, a page explaining additional funding was coming from the supplemental, and then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10654.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, doing the addition or whatever and the final number, just to make it clear and to keep track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could do that, I think that that would at least be a start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10689.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly what you're expressing to us is it's a fluid situation so that when you post it, you can post it with that caveat as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11989.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, again, I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11991.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley, and I'd like to make a motion to accept their report and put it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12006.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did, well, we received the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12013.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and in our conversation, I did ask Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12016.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley to send it to us, which I trust she will, but it is typical that you receive a report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12025.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I don't have any reason to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12030.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: not think that this presentation then counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12034.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, it's the way that you move on the conversation when we don't have another motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12044.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the way that we end the discussion and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12070.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll make the motion to say, I mean, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12074.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley already said to me that she was going to supply to us, but I make a motion that the director, the city director of finance supply to the school committee, a copy of her report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12280.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes so first I want to thank my colleague Melanie McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12286.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know there was a phone call<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12288.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a couple of days afterwards and I know I was on it and Melanie was on it and in fact took a, you know, participated and Dr. Edouard-Vincent was on it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12301.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that probably really helped that you both were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12306.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I don't know exactly, is there a dollar amount attached to this or is it more in terms of hours of training or how is it stipulated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12319.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12320.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12379.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12380.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4118.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4164.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, there's one that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4167.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is separate from the rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4170.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's from Cynthia Kinnan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4172.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cynthia lives at 156 George Street, and she has given me permission to paraphrase it and stick to main points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4183.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, I want to express that I see a full return to in-person school or failing that a fully in-person option for all students next year as vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4196.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a parent and an economist, I've been following the research on the consequences of disrupted schooling for both children and parents, and I find them very concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4205.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While the evidence on the possibility of safe return to school from a public health perspective is quite promising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4212.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus, where my son is in kindergarten and has done a terrific job under extremely tough circumstances, as has the district as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4220.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The weekly COVID testing program is wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4223.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nonetheless, hybrid rather than fully in-person school has been very challenging for our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4231.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, teacher and student safety is paramount for the return to fully in-person school next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4236.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would appreciate guidance from the school district on what I and other parents can do now and going forward to help ensure the conditions are in place for a full return to in-person school in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4248.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that by furthering this conversation now, we can make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4252.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there is time to get the necessary funding and resources in place for next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4258.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, there are also many letters pertaining to the Columbus School discussion, which is later on in our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4267.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps we should save them to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=5059.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6338.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6339.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention how wonderful it was to have the opportunity to join in the middle school assembly this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6348.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Frankly, you know, as a school committee member, one of the great joys is to be able to see our students in action and when we've been all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6357.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On Zoom, that's been harder to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6359.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So bringing us this assembly, getting to see our kids and a lot of them, it was just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6365.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you and thanks to all the students and of course to their leadership, Mr. Skorka, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6370.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Olson, Mr. Trotta and everybody else who's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6374.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's something that makes us feel very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=7005.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9470.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to let my fellow committee members know that both the mayor and I, the superintendent, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Cushing, were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I've got everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're in attendance at the request of Pat Jalen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9487.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was invited as vice chair to represent the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9492.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Pat had set up, excuse me, Senator Jalen had set up a Zoom call with DESE, their finance people to talk about the impact of the charter school tuitions on our budget, which is extreme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9509.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The mayor alluded to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9511.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: approximately $1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9513.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In truth, it becomes even more than that, closer to a million and a quarter when something else is factored in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9520.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very clear that the people we were talking about were budget people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9525.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's their job to simply implement the formula and not to do anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9531.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our entire delegation was there, Senator Jayland, Representatives Donato, Garbley, and Barber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9540.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Donato spoke to the fact that last year, we also sort of fell into this little pit where our funding was lower and they had put together some legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9553.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we spoke, and I was quite adamant about the impact of how starting with a million and a quarter blow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9564.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in our funding would impact us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9567.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's some discussion about what the legislators have to do to try and help us with this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9574.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, though, the reality of it is, is the way the funding formula works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9579.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really get sucker punched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9581.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And our delegation is totally aware and totally desirous of being helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9590.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It may be advantageous for us to invite them to a committee meeting at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9596.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with a follow-up and talk about what other options, what can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9602.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because right now, I mean, you know, it's a real issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9852.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9856.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9857.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a role for the school committee in being able to attend any of the sessions or how is that envisioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10516.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, no, I just wanted to second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10518.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know if anybody had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10590.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I feel like that I need to convey to the committee, and I'm sure many committee members know because we've received so many emails to our personal accounts, but there were many submitted to the school committee account as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10606.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had roughly 30 letters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10611.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: all of which were similar, saying to us, please don't continue this discussion, don't change the name, and suggesting that this was the wrong time and the timing would distract us from other work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10626.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The letters were similar, so I know that committee members have seen them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10630.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I were to read them all, it would take several hours of our time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10636.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Conversely, we also received almost an equal number supporting the name change with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10645.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The letters were a little bit more different, more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10648.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: diverse in their discussions, but again asking that we do keep to our intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10656.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was one submitted I want to mention in particular by a third grade student who also asked us please to keep to our intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10669.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly people thought that we might be changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10672.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also a petition submitted by Medford United<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10677.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it is appropriate for me to just read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10681.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says please join Medford Mass residents in signing this petition requesting the Medford Mass School Committee and it names us immediately rescind their vote to change the name of the Columbus Elementary School in operation since 1929.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10694.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The name change was approved without community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10697.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Community input and transparency should be sought before major decisions are made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10702.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please sign the petition so we may right this wrong and be the vibrant community we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10707.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were 395 Medford residents on this, but more than, and with 1,426 additional names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10710.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10719.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is our custom to ask for addresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10722.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just signed with names on the emails I was receiving, you know, I don't think people are necessarily clear all the times that they're supposed to have their address as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10732.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I started writing back to people, but frankly, there were so many kind of got out of hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10737.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of these will be submitted to be part of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10741.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll work with Susie on that tomorrow so that we're sure that they're read into the record or they're written into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10750.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this point, what I hear your intent is that we're gonna go ahead with the meeting we have, but I do want you to, I wanted to present both the pro and the con and the very deep feelings that people have both ways, very deep feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10771.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I can interject a personal note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10775.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question is in this very difficult discussion for in our community because it is and has been divisive is how can we come together in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10786.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is my deepest hope is that we will find a way to find some common language and common desire around this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10797.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so that, in fact, it doesn't divide us, but it brings us together in celebration of a rich Italian culture, which maybe isn't defined by the name Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11107.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I guess one of the things which I'm wondering is if there's a way, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11116.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we need some help, I think, bringing our community together on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11122.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I think it's deeply painful to see such a large rift and people on both sides, you know, obviously very committed, but I don't see yet, you know, I don't see a bridge forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11138.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if anybody, you know, I'm wondering whether there's any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11146.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: any steps we can take, and if any community members have some thoughts in this of how we can help bridge this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11157.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that many people have suggested that we understand the Italian community's concern about losing a landmark that is important to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11171.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so many of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11175.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, there's so many different names that could possibly be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11180.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were to not only, you know, to think about it in a broader sense as an opportunity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11188.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I personally feel it's extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11192.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know when I first came to Medford, I found myself delightfully surrounded in a neighborhood where, you know, by a wonderful warm Italian family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11205.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who took us in, who was so valuable to my own adjustment to Medford, and where I learned about gravy rather than sauce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11214.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering, again, whether there's a, people are very strongly feeling they're negative about taking away Columbus, but I just wanna, is there any potential of going forward and thinking about, is there any place where we might move towards honoring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11234.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: our Italian heritage in this community with a different name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11241.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to throw that out and say, you know, I'm hoping that somebody might start thinking about that in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11253.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, and the only other thing I did want to mention is we had originally said it was important for our students at the Columbus to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11261.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I want to make sure we don't forget that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12403.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12406.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, if I could interrupt for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12410.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just made aware of a mistake which I made, and it's important enough to interrupt and say that the person who wrote it to me is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12422.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I didn't say was that I also, when we were talking about the Columbus School emails, I also had received several emails from members of the Italian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12433.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: American community who were not in support of the Columbus name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12437.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the person who wrote me said that she did not want people to think that all of residents of the Italian community were of one mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12447.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make that correction and to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12451.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we'll give you the email so that everybody can see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12457.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm so sorry and appreciate the correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12748.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, actually on this one, I do disagree because I think that we're going to have so many questions around how different things are going to be handled as we're coming out of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12761.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I will vote along with it if we can add a caveat that we would be informed about the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12769.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so that we can follow up with questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12772.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12774.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, does that cover, we were going to have kids going to Hawaii, well, what if, or Italy or whatever, you know, does that mean that that wouldn't be brought before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12784.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was scheduled in this past, you know, so I'm just, I don't know, a little bit, I do think that there's things that we would particularly want the committee members would particularly be interested, especially since we have a lot of responsibility in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12879.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, would you be okay if we just added a sentence that the school committee will be informed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12886.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12888.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, by email prior to- Absolutely, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12892.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A trip taking place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12894.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12896.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so we have some opportunity to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12953.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, I would be comfortable with upon approval from the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12962.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't, as a school committee member, I don't personally need to do it, but I wanna make sure that there is a check in place because there have been differing circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12974.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I can add, upon approval by the superintendent, I'm fine with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12983.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=6.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=14.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have any scars yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=275.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would you be coming out and back in public, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2072.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2080.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2081.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was many hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2082.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2088.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes tensions ran high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2090.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2098.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2103.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much and to your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2306.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm all set mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2307.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4417.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4420.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is one letter from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4446.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this email, which came in at 3.49 this afternoon, says, hello all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4452.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't see it on the posted agenda, but I'm wondering if it is possible to get an update on the status of the formation of a committee to make plans for next steps of the Columbus name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4463.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4464.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Submitted by Emma Heffron, 18 Curtis Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4468.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you recall, we actually had a letter last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4471.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did say that would be on, I thought it was going to be on today's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4476.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps I'd make a motion that we put it on next, at our next meeting's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4525.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I also just wanted to announce that there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday from 4 to 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4533.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll be discussing the global language program as well as technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4539.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of our members can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4541.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if anybody else can, I'd love to have another member present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4545.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you'd let me know you're available, please, I would most appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4553.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Four to six Wednesday, this Wednesday, the 27th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4557.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4604.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=5261.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Shout out, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6185.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received a letter from a member of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6188.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is from Leticia Roca.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6192.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, my name is Leticia Roca of 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6197.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have the following questions regarding the public health updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6201.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One, where exactly can we find updated data about the number of staff members and students that have tested positive across the different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6210.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this on the school website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6212.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was talked about multiple times during these meetings, but I've yet to see this information divulged consistently online in an accessible manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6220.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, Tufts students are returning to campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6224.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will you continue to calculate the Medford positivity rate without Tufts tests?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6228.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And where will this updated information be publicized consistently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6233.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then three, has it been officially established that families have the option for remote only learning for the rest of this school year until June?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6243.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If yes, where can we find this official statement by the MPS administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6247.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Regards, Leticia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8034.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8035.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8036.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank you, Mr. DeLiva, for your presentation and Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8042.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In regards specifically to the Tufts, were there quite a number of students who were interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8078.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing I wondered is if there was a second student who was particularly interested, and I don't know whether that's the case, but whether we could go back to Tufts and say, hey, we've got another student who's really interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8090.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if that were being, I'm all hypothetical here, but if there was any thought that there was another student who was a close call, I would certainly encourage you to say, could we go back and ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8105.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: because there is a certain flexibility too with perhaps making a class of another extra student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8112.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see Dr. Cushing has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8142.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8143.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One can only always want more though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8145.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8147.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8148.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8620.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also appreciated the job description and the intent behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8624.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10790.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10792.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just think it's important to mention, since two of my colleagues mentioned that we're sort of late into the year of setting these goals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10802.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is saying that we're so yay late because there's a pandemic and the superintendents was working as many of us noted Earlier around the clock for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10812.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10813.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10814.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to thank her for all the work that she's done at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10821.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I certainly support looking at the goals for another week and revisiting them, I just think it's really, really important to acknowledge all the incredible work the superintendent and her team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11708.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you restate the motion in our paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12369.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so member Rousseau, I'm a little torn here because I can actually see both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12376.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I don't think that you're correct in saying there's, we're only gonna send it to subcommittee if I'm going to get my way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12384.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The whole point of a subcommittee discussion should be an opportunity to get more input, not only from perhaps parents, but also from our educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12395.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The high school graduation has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12397.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: mentioned multiple times and you know I used to have a really hard time with it because I was like, Jesus, there's a lot of kids in this audience who, you know, they got the flu or they broke their arm or something happened and they couldn't go to school and now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12411.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, again, maybe they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12414.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're finding satisfaction in some other ways, and there may have been kids and I certainly remember, I mean one year there was a year where there was only one kid, but one year there was like five or six and it was amazing that all those kids had really been able to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12432.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is called out at the high school, and it's always by the audience really appreciated and I've always felt kind of funny because I do feel kind of funny about it because I share your concerns about does it does it motivate kids but you know I never knew we gave that award until I went to the high school graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12451.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know how many kids know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12454.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My kids never talked about it and said, oh boy, I'm not going to get the perfect attendance award because they never, you know, it just wasn't part of their thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12462.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, so I totally supported going to subcommittee for the purposes of discussion and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12468.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that, you know, part of it is to be open-minded and listen to other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12475.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what I would be wanting to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13355.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13407.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13411.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13522.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13529.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1616.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, um, the thing is that it's changed, it's changed a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1620.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I personally don't think that the committee has agreed on the next step and I think we need to that that's would be the focus of mean some uniform way of presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1634.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I had thought that the superintendent was going to present to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1639.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know that the expectation was that we would be giving her feedback in writing tonight, at least, or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1649.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd be interested in hearing what member Graham has to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1654.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What her expectations were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2314.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2319.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, I think you said in your first sentence that a rubric will be created, but the rubric already exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2324.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just to create a template for us, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2689.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Notwithstanding all of that and the process, I think that it's only appropriate, though, and Kathy made some comments, and I know we don't want to go into large comments, so I'm just going to say this has been an extraordinarily challenging year, and I think that the superintendent has risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hAlwg1wwBNo&t=3306.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to point out, Mr. Gertman had his hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hAlwg1wwBNo&t=3310.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3295.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3296.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Melanie, Medford was one of the key districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3301.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were either six, there's been one that went in and out and whatever, but was one of the original districts that started Shore Collaborative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3310.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we had a very special relationship with them for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3314.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had far more students than our present enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3320.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the number of students has fallen as we've brought more kids back into our own programs, for example, and either sought different alternatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3332.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things about SURE was that it started out because the costs for outplacements were so high and districts working together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3342.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: determined that they could provide better quality programs for a lot less expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3349.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: SURE was originally directed under Hank Owens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3352.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You may know the SURE Center is called the Hank Owens Report, who was a very dynamic leader for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3362.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that, you know, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3366.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really a terrific opportunity when you are the rep, because you get to meet monthly with a school committee member from each of the member districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3379.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I always know when I was the rep, as Paul is now, that that was a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3384.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But our membership has fallen a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3388.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we still have that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3390.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're still one of the founding members and whatever, but we've never had that with any other out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3396.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: out placement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3592.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I had put that on because, so over the years it's differed, but there were some years when we've had the student rep has asked to give a report, and it's maybe been a couple of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3605.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Every time they do, we've asked them, say, this is terrific, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3610.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and we ask them to continue to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3612.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because the students change, unless we're asking for it, I don't think that they'll, the students won't necessarily know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3619.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I put, I was one of the people who put it on saying that we've done it in the past and when we do, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3627.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we should ask that it be done at least on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3632.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the student reps obviously are always there to be able to contribute, but I think that sometimes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3637.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: asking for them to give us a report has been very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3660.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3664.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With food service, it was my understanding that we were supposed to have just the way we have a PAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3669.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think with food service, unless it's changed, we were also supposed to have a inclusive committee for food service that would also give feedback to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3683.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't believe we met, obviously last year isn't a good comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3691.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But certainly for many years, we would meet yearly for food service report, which was also inclusive of issues with food service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3701.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have asked for some feedback about the quality of the food, what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3707.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Usually there were students included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3709.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's kind of dropped off recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3712.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sorry, my other phone is ringing, so I'll mute myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3715.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=160.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=163.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Me and the stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=167.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=167.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=168.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=169.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=229.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=230.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=231.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You should first ask if there are any other nominations, and then the nomination has to be said by saying the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=310.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=312.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did speak to Member Ruseau earlier today, and we agreed that if any letters come in today, since I wasn't familiar yet with the process, that he would read them today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=322.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll take over in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=327.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you'll be the secretary one more night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=610.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to – I was in signing the bills last Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=615.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Finally, a lot of bills came through for food service, which I had been sort of on the lookout for, so I was glad to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=624.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everything else seemed to be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=626.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank all of the secretaries, particularly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=631.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Gina Citrano, who sort of helps organize the bills for me, but everybody who is involved in the process of getting the bills together and making sure that we are in order and our bills are being paid as they should be appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=650.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a lot of paperwork involved and I just am very appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2626.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are in the pool or expected to be in the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5563.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mr. Downs and Dr. Burnham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5567.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very interested in hearing about the restorative justice piece that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5571.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Downs, I did notice in your report you included some great comments, very positive comments, and showcasing real success, especially many comments around the just gratefulness for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5586.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: expressed that the kids were able to be attending school in a hybrid way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5592.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did notice that you didn't necessarily tell us what the negative comments were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5598.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I were to just ask you about what one or two of the most insightful comments on how you could improve, what areas were most suggested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5615.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5616.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm assuming that because you said, here are the positive comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5711.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really do applaud the book club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5714.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's great when you've got your staff coming together to discuss, you know, some new ideas and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5722.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: really reflect on thinking, so I think that's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5726.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to also ask you though, is there any, I was just kind of been kind of curious, we haven't heard much about transportation issues this year, and I've been wondering how the transportation and the bus, whether many students are using it, what you're seeing, and if you could just address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7201.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask, when I look at the schedule, that last piece, the spring sports going to July 3rd, that means that our seniors would have already graduated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7215.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will they continue to be eligible to play?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7217.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how's that going to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7256.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think that the fact that the season will go beyond the end of school, will our students still continue to participate and not be deterred by that late cutoff date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8691.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8692.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank Melanie for bringing it to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=545.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=545.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=546.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as you can see, we have some terrific leadership in Brian Buck, who's joined us as president this year, and David in his continuing role as the grants chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=558.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane Caldwell is going to join our little group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=563.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what we are really in need of is we are in need of some fundraising people because that's a major piece of what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=570.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's exciting, it's fun work, it's fun to be able to give out money, and we really appreciate the teachers who take the time to put in a grant because there's no guarantee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=581.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things though that happened on this is that because of the number of, you know, we saw a good number of requests for Pear Deck,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=590.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I was able to go follow up and have a discussion about that and find out that, yes, the district is in fact going to supply that to our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=599.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when we saw such interest coming in from teachers, that was just a really great thing to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=604.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a couple of people I'd like to thank specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=607.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had long talks with Molly Layden, our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=611.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of Technology, with Bernadette Riccadeli, with Chad Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=619.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm afraid I'm going to leave some people out, but I was very, very appreciative to get their expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=625.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we were following up on these grant proposals, we were doing it wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=632.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=634.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=647.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=653.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, time flies when you're having fun, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2748.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2749.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry I didn't realize it was muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2751.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I couldn't unmute myself but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2753.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank Miss Baptiste and the students for bringing us that lovely presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2759.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier I was thinking about how much I missed all the holiday concerts that they, for I've gone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2766.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for many years, and they've just always added that certain sense of time and celebration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2772.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it really felt funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2773.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I walked into the high school this morning for another reason and saw the empty auditorium and wished I was going there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2781.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really appreciate that this was brought to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2784.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was speaking to a friend who is a member of the Boston Gay Men's Choir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2788.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they had done a piece, and he was explaining the process of how difficult it was to get everybody coordinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2797.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And hearing our teacher doing this work with our students is particularly heartwarming to know that they've gone through the same process and all the labor, a labor of love, and thank you for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=130.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=132.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=134.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Vanderkloot, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=136.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2551.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2553.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we had the building the future committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2555.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would say that it came somewhat similar in that there was a great deal of discussion amongst in the community about the shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2567.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then several school committee members, including myself spearheaded, bringing it to the floor for discussion and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2577.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2579.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which helped us was we had dynamic leadership of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2584.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rick Orlando and Tricia McDonough really did such an incredibly fabulous job outlining the path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2592.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first discussions were, there was a series of events around the community, listening events, getting people's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2602.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2603.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they seeing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2604.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were their reactions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2607.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and their concerns as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2610.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And remember, at that point, there was no, you know, in a similar way, we had not preconceived that we were going to build four new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2619.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2620.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of that came into being over the course of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2626.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the committee looking at the various different resources, concerns, land parcels availability, but even would they be K to H, would they be, none of that was preconceived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2641.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was all part of the work of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2645.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was then defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2648.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that was extremely important was there were different phases of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2653.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first was kind of the outreach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2656.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then the second was taking the information and coming up with some decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2661.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And those ones then were brought to the school committee for our input, because if we weren't buying it, there was no way we were going to be able to sell it to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2673.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then a variety of different meetings happened around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2678.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: uh Medford uh you know outreaching to different groups and whatnot explaining what was um uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2686.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what project proposals there were, what ideas there were, and narrowing it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2691.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's really quite a process in the same way that I think that we're thinking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2697.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Were there discussions about educational?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2701.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, absolutely, and they need to be included as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2705.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things though that is very interesting sort of looking back is that there will be people who say, I just don't understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2716.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they really have no understanding today why certain decisions were made back then about either the placement of the schools or why there's a K to eight and a middle school on one piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2732.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's one of the interesting things as time goes on, those pieces are lost to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2737.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we have people saying, I don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2741.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can tell you that all of those decisions were thoroughly vetted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2746.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and that there was a basis for each one of those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2750.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But over time, it does get lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2752.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's a valuable thing for me to realize as we go forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2758.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do wanna mention, by the way, that there was at the time, the third stage of building the future committee, which is what we called it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2770.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The third stage was the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2773.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there was some work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2775.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, things done over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2777.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at some point, Dr. Perrella, you may recall, the former headmaster of the high school, he put together a, he wanted to put together a grant and he looked very much at the library area and discussed a lot about what should be happening educationally in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2799.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought it was a very thorough vetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2801.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a, at the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2804.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a, they put together a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2807.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's something that you know as we're talking about the things we're talking about not just the physical structure but how is the building going to be used educationally, we should, even though of course I'm sure it needs to be updated but we should look back to that, what happened at that point to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2824.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The, it was a very dedicated group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2831.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They had to be able to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2833.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at first we were meeting weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2837.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could check with Rick Orlando and Tricia about exactly that, but it was a long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2844.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would say that it was probably about a year before we came<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2849.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: was the first presentation and the first narrowing down steps was, you know, it was a significant process of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2860.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if that answers the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2894.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2895.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We certainly had a few staff, but there were also people who acted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2899.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They might have attended the meetings because they were giving information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2903.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2905.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, so it depended, but I think we were we really started at ground zero without great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2914.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, with no preconceptions about what was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3456.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things I just wanted to mention was the importance of also having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3464.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: members go out and even if just in the initial process we did visitations to other school districts and that was so important and that's really harder to do right now because of COVID but you know most of us are framed you know we know our high school maybe we've been in another one but we certainly you know haven't been in a lot and we we went to quite a few other districts and that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3491.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very instrumental and that required that people were also available to take some time during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3501.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was important because it excited us incredibly to see, to come out of our world and also to see what was being offered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3513.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3514.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just want to mention that, that maybe it can be conveyed somewhat by people visiting and then doing presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3523.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They can be, you know, that might be a job, if you would, that some people go, a smaller amount go and then make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3531.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's just another aspect we want to make sure we're doing is visitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4415.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to ask member Rousseau to read what he had read at the beginning, his charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4422.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, can you just repeat it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4597.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Paul, you know personally I think that's a fine starting point to be able to I mean, to take what Paul has has written and for us that to deliberate on it to give feedback to the superintendent and, and, you know, for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4617.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, then if she could develop some way to share that with us, and then I think that would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4625.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I can understand Jenny's concern about not Maurice having too much, I think it's absolutely critical that Maurice does play a strong role in this development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4637.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4640.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I like Paul's starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4642.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4643.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's a good place to begin with, it's solid, but yet there's also a lot of potentials for discussion as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4698.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2337.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you ended up really on the key point that I think we're all concerned about is what will be the impact of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2346.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And especially, like I can, if I think about eighth grade, the eighth grade course, we've talked about many, many times how intense that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2356.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so now those kids have gone on into ninth grade, and I'm wondering what the teachers are telling you and what you're seeing so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2438.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious whether you're seeing a difference in the students who are fully remote versus the students who are hybrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2538.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm having some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2539.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't unmute myself except by the space bar, and I can't go into a gallery view, so I can't see other people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2548.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Jenny, I'm gonna ask you if you can, can you see, if you can see everybody, could you call on people for questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2792.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3711.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that the superintendent had her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4091.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you see other hands up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4092.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or if not, I've got some more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you're just making me feel better today, Faiza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4788.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's okay for me to forget something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4800.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly in the middle of the night, you will pop up and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4828.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4829.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a couple of questions, but except is Ingrid, did Ingrid have a follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4840.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ingrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4841.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question I had was for, I was curious whether we had had any parent feedback on illustrative math so far, and also we had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4855.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You talked about the professional development that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4857.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did we have or how many new math teachers did we have into the system at the beginning of this year that needed to have professional development and was that completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4927.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to, yesterday by chance I had a discussion with Molly Layden about the document cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4934.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seems like they're such a popular item right now, they're delayed for another month or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4942.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, do some of the teachers have them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4983.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I wanted to circle back to my colleague's discussion about creating a catalog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4991.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Faiza, you seem like you're well on your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4995.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, with the information you've presented us tonight, would it be appropriate, Superintendent, to ask Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5002.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn to begin that piece of documenting for the mathematics curriculum, what we are calling a catalog?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5012.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But Faiza, I think you heard some of the information that we want, and Jenny, if you could weigh in about other things that you had in mind, particularly for the creation of this document,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5269.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be careful, though, because it's not the it's not the school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5272.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to give you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5275.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: direction in whatever I so I had referred through the superintendent whether it would be possible given Wisconsin excellent report tonight if we went on and you know if you might have the discussion with her about taking this to the next step and beginning this process of creating the catalog and you know would seem like as we have these meetings that that's exactly what we should do as sort of after after each meeting is asking the department head<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5305.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to in fact create that kind of information that it would be a logical next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5309.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Superintendent if you'd address that please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5558.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5559.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5777.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so speaking of squeezing it all in, our next meeting is going to concentrate in January on foreign languages and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5786.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We wanted to get to foreign language because we had raised some questions about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5791.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And technology was also in, it's gonna be a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5796.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might certainly schedule it for a two hour block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5801.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have time to devote to each area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5806.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: February was supposed to be science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5809.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then March was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5811.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: English language arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5813.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know, Jenny, you had asked whether ELA could come sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5818.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent, I'm not sure if you had the chance to have that discussion with Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5915.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to say at the beginning of the meeting, I was flustered enough with my technology snafus that I didn't announce that the members of the subcommittee are myself and Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5928.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia couldn't make it, but Paul Rousseau was in attendance tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5933.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we appreciate that he was here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5937.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any further thoughts before we wrap this meeting up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5967.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5968.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn, I would particularly like to thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5971.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've always enjoyed when you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5973.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6083.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion, Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6085.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1368.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1369.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so we met on November 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1371.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present was myself, Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1374.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia could not make it, so Paul Rousseau attended in her place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1379.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We began with a presentation from Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lark, co-chairs of the Medford CPAC, and they made a presentation reminding us that they speak for 20% of Medford Public Schools students and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1394.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that they've been advocating for a disability awareness program for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1405.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, Melanie McLaughlin also attended, and she was the previous head of the CPAC, and also was very active in this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1416.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: advocating for this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1418.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Joan Bowen and Susanna Campbell presented the disability awareness in the classroom presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1425.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Susanna Campbell is presented an overview of the course that she ran last year and is going to now run again this January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1436.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The professional development is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1438.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: available on the Professional Development website and is now open for registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1444.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's open to all staff, not just teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1448.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The program is going to run Thursday afternoons from 3.15 to 5.15 in January and February via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1454.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The course includes the history of disabilities in the U.S.,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1460.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1461.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: legislation, ableism, belief in our society that not being disabled is the norm, disability etiquette, so teachers can model disability etiquette, and asking a person what they want, if they want assistance rather than stepping in, and the unique needs of students with various disabilities, and also tools to break down stereotypes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1490.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Key curricular concepts are positive representation of people with disabilities in content area lessons, universal design for learning helps all have better access, anti-ableism language practice into content area lessons, reframe misconceptions, building a more inclusive environment and creating a better community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1517.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next steps,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1520.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is to recruit is to have the PD course January and February of 2021 then recruit volunteers to pilot a disability awareness curriculum in February 2021 and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1533.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a pilot in classrooms, March to May 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1538.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not a one and done, and this is one of the most important things that really was stressed in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1545.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This disability awareness, we want it to be embedded into everyday instruction, so that it's not something that which simply just happens once, it's a, you know, get some fanfare, and then it's left behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1557.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rather, the concept<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1558.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and the awareness needs to be embedded into the curriculum so it is ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1562.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1565.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about a book that one fifth grade teacher was using and the lesson plans that had come out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1575.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Last time, 48 teachers took the course and it's hoping that there will be as many this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1584.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's done on a volunteer basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1588.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the end result is creating curriculum units that can be shared amongst our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1601.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we talked a little bit about why we weren't doing a specialized curriculum, but rather embedding it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1610.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC had done research on this in past years and there had been an attempt at the one school, but it ended up being a special event rather than having the long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1625.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1629.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're starting from the pilot and we're growing from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1632.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1638.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Susanna Campbell mentioned that we're taking a two-pronged course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1641.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One is about teaching students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1643.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other part is teaching teachers to use universal design to help them become more knowledgeable about disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1655.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've asked that there would be a report and update at the end of the year, and that's been scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1661.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we'll be reporting back to the committee about how many teachers signed up and took the course and how many volunteers we had and how we were able to implement this this year, this year being 2021 in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1679.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I just want to mention to you that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1684.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next meeting is on December 10th, but that is this Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1689.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're going to be looking at the math curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1692.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also wanted to convey our thanks both to the, particularly to Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorick of the CPAC and to Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen for all the work they did in giving the information for us for this subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1712.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1744.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I just ask, do we have a student representative tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1748.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see a student on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1749.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to introduce yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2284.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Always trying to shut me up some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2286.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I just, just for the public, we're not, I'm not going to address this right now only because I think we have some reports coming and we certainly will have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2321.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2340.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4670.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4671.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear on making sure that I understand the teacher's statement and the information that, Tony, you're supplying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4683.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, my understanding was that there was only one in-school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4691.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have any more than that at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4705.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we've heard that there's a large number of teachers out at the Roberts in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4714.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's because they are quarantining?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4741.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a positive case that was in school, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4767.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we are not seeing in-school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4770.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I understand it correctly, what you're saying is that because of the testing and our ability to pick up cases, we are getting to those students and faculty members before they've actually become positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4789.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand the, you know, when all of a sudden we hear that there's a greater number of teachers who are on quarantine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4817.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4818.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think all of us feel this right now, this anxiety as we see the case number get higher and higher throughout not only Massachusetts, but the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4830.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4833.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's very unsettling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4835.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying is so far the data says that we're doing okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4866.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, by no means am I dismissing the anxiety attached to being told you should quarantine or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4874.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand that that is an important piece of what our staff and teachers are conveying to us is that they're nervous about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4888.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying right now is there's really been no change in the data, which would suggest that we need to do something different in terms of having students come to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4899.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4959.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess then the next question really goes to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4963.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we see the number of staff getting higher because they're on quarantine, do we have enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4972.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that there's been an incredible effort<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4976.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to cover classes and that the administrative people and others have just really stepped up and covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4984.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But when we see what's going on at the Roberts right now with a certain level of teachers being out, are we able to cover the classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4992.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it still working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8206.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8211.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I was going to that next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8214.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9816.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9819.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is a very positive thing for our students, and I particularly like to see the teachers who responded about how this, even though students may not be in school, it's still pulling them together and creating a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9833.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11582.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11584.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11588.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11589.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, I want to express my gratitude for the extensive amount of work in putting this together and updating it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11598.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11599.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're very comprehensive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11603.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, on page 28 on the form itself, bullying incident reporting form, I see that it says date of report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11613.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but I don't see a line that says date of incident or even date of alleged incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11620.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so a report could be made six days afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11626.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should clarify what the date is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11631.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, perhaps it does exist someplace, or maybe you just assume that somebody would write it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11636.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But just in case, to me, that just stood out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11641.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, do you want to talk to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11653.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11655.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thing I want to speak to is that when I see the page and I'm flipping back about notifications, there's not a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11663.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm concerned that there aren't timelines put into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11666.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Notify parents, caregiver of the target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11671.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11672.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, all of a sudden, you know, when the investigative report, I sort of, I think that we, that we need to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11683.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand timelines are tricky because there's holidays, there's weekends, there's whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11688.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet without any timeline, you kind of take away some level of teeth to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11695.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, my colleague Melanie brought up many good reports and I really do like the idea of a simple one page thing, a summary, in some ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11706.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the other thing which makes me a little bit nervous is that because this is so comprehensive, I'm not really comfortable just approving it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11714.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And normally I would expect that this would go, and I know nobody wants to have another meeting, but normally I would expect it to go to rules and regulations or whatever policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11727.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So rather than just approving it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11730.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're not gonna send it there, and I don't know the will of the committee, I would suggest we lay it on the table and we have updates, the one page update added to it before our approval at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11744.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I would like to, I'm not gonna make the motion, I'd like my colleagues to weigh in and let me know what their comfort level is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11796.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, that's kind of an unusual way for a school committee to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11802.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, because part of me would say that you'd certainly be following this better policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11812.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11817.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What about the timelines issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to add the date of the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11854.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11869.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I would like to see it where it says date of report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to find the page again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11878.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It might be 28.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11880.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm looking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11883.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11885.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where it says date of report, right underneath that, if you move that up rather than making it, it should say date of incident or date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11896.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be dates, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11899.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I see some of my colleagues have their hands up, so I'd like them to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12311.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12316.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12317.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia Mastone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12320.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Vanderkloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12971.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe that the first piece of that is that the superintendent would supply the school committee with a self evaluation and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12983.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: certainly support that it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, but I think that it's a little bit unfair to ask her to have that ready by December 21st in just two weeks, given all that she's handling right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13001.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would respectfully ask that we put it to the first meeting that she would supply us that documentation at the first meeting of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13166.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13167.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it certainly, Kathy, since you had that review, if you could just send it to the rest of us so we could see the other steps involved, I think that would be important for us to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13395.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but keep in mind that we have, in fact, been setting goals for the superintendent throughout this period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13402.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked about goals of inclusivity, of involving, if you think about all the meetings that we had during the summer, we've set a goal about getting kids back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13412.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like, I realize it hasn't been in the formal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13418.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: way that you're suggesting, but it would be erroneous to think that we haven't been giving direction to our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13429.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we certainly have plenty to be able to reflect upon on how she has been handling this process, which is, in my opinion, been extremely strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13443.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My recollection from all other times is what we do is that each of us individually will fill out an evaluation once the superintendent gives us her self evaluation and then we'll gather as a committee and discuss it and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13461.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: decide how we're gonna come up with either a collaborative document to then share with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13470.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think in the past, the superintendent has been part of those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13474.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think that the next step is to review what we're supposed to do technically, just to, so we all are on the same page, and that we ask the superintendent to provide us with her self-evaluation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13489.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: by mid-January at the latest, so that we can go ahead with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13494.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we're all in agreement, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13524.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think we've already articulated many goals which we could write down and then we could take a look at and articulate goals for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13562.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, and the superintendent also has a major piece in setting out goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13568.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a joint conversation because she's very much will be a piece of articulating those goals and quantifying them as you suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13837.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's set it for February 8th, that it will be done by February 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13867.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the 8th, the process should be complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13870.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that means that if the superintendent gives us her self-evaluation at the first<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13876.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or even the second meeting in January, and the first might be preferable, or mid-Feb, whatever, that we will have set up a committee of the whole meeting, and we will commit to having done the self-evaluations and the other steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13924.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm saying that because I think Jenny does have a point that we want to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13928.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I'm putting an end date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13930.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we get it done before that, that's even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13933.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this way, we've given the superintendent enough time, but we've committed ourselves to making sure it gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14104.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I would ask that we allow the superintendent a little bit more time than the first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14109.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to Member Graham, this is part of the superintendent's job to set up these meetings and do it in a timely fashion and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14120.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I sometimes feel like it's important to let her have the latitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14126.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14127.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: your need to make sure that it's started early and that process is started early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14132.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I just personally, I think that we need to trust the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14142.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if she's not setting up the budget in a timely fashion or whatever, and I just don't think we have to legislate it as my own personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14153.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that if you're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14154.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Concerned about it or any member is concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14158.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that for me that the best way about it is having conversation with the superintendent and only if she's not then being responsive would you then go about and put it in a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14169.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my personal opinion is that this falls under the superintendent's purview and you're suggesting I think that you would like to have it sooner rather than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14182.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you want to go forward with your resolution, which I'm sure you do, I would just suggest that we say that by the end of January, just to give her a little more latitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14191.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would amend it to be the end of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14256.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will you accept the amendment to the end of January, Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14384.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think I've offered an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14386.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Kathy has seconded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14388.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So should we vote on the amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14403.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14658.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14660.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that means, will the superintendent then report back to us at our next school committee meeting about when that report can be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=39.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2325.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I just wanted to go back to Mary Ann if I could, or Tony, I don't know who better to ask this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2332.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So all together there we have 27 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2335.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When the contact tracers call their home,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2338.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it generally, like of the 27, do they know where they were in contact with someone with COVID?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2348.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do they have certainty of the, like you mentioned, well, the father had it or the mother, or do you have people saying, I have no idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2395.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you follow up and ask them if they've been going to the grocery store and other specifics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2411.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the students, of the 27 students, if we could talk about in-school transmission, how many of those are suspected to be in-school transmission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2439.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in the in-school transmission case, and I realize we don't obviously wanna identify anybody, but how was it determined that that student, did they come to school sick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2456.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just give us a better understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2482.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3082.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4982.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I know they've been waiting an awful long time, but what I would do is I could just ask Member Graham one question for clarification, and then if you would call upon me after we let the residents speak, I don't want them to have to wait any longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4995.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the clarification is, Jenny, you mentioned maybe I should make an amendment, maybe it should be a new resolution, but I wasn't sure what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5005.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: precisely you are either amending or what your resolution would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5009.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you give us the wording so we understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5123.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to clarify, if there was the Brooks School classroom, second grade was sent home, it would say, you know, so sort of a red flag, current closures, Brooks School, grade two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5139.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we- Select grade two or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5142.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so that's just a total hypothetical to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5146.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But then the question is when we do that, and this goes back to Marianne, is the whole confidentiality issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5157.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And are we really giving people more, I mean, if grade two is closed at whatever school, okay, wouldn't automatically, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5170.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: parents would be notified, let's face it, the school would soon know, what are you really accomplishing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5176.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, yes, it is a way of, it would be one way of seeing it across the district, and from that, I like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5183.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, Brooks grade two, Roberts grade four, you know, Cohart C, you know, that would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5241.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if the box said, or if the next current closures, okay, so the box said current closures, and right now, do we have any closures, superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5258.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me ask the confidentiality question first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5526.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mayor, I actually had the floor, but I wanna get to, I know Mr. Began has had his hand up for a long time and there are others, but, and then I'd like to make a statement afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5548.587s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think he heard you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5550.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6125.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6126.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, some of the speakers made points that I wanted to make and first I will start out with Mr. begins point that the really great news is just the one in school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6139.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's, that's just fantastic news and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6143.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we can certainly hope that we can continue that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6149.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To the speaker who talked about the role of the school committee and us representing, well, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6157.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I was elected, I always take that a certain amount of people at least have enough faith in my judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6166.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes we will disagree, but overall, you have listened to me enough and you have some level of faith in my thinking and in my judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6177.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a school committee member, I have watched our superintendent and her team very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6185.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We looked at the policies that we've outlined and I see them following them and working very meticulously as many of the speakers made reference to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6197.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have personally no reason to question her judgment on making a call if we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6207.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: facing a situation, I believe that she would evaluate with her team and with the city people, and also maybe a call to the school committee members, because we certainly would want to be kept in the loop, but I've never felt that I've not been kept in the loop by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6225.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I wouldn't need to be called into a special meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6228.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wouldn't want to put that as this body, the school committee, now would be the ones who make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6237.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have trust that the school committee has selected our superintendent to carry out our policies and I have every reason to believe that that's what she would be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6251.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would support the motion by my colleague and also like to thank everybody for all their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6260.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: work on these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6262.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would support the clarification that member Graham spoke to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6270.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the general sense, not specific, because I think we went through the discussion about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6275.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6278.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you wanted to do an analogy, we could talk about snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6283.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And some might say, well, Paulette, you're making it so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6287.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But frankly, when there's a snow day, a superintendent makes a call with a lot of different inputs about the safety<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6298.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of the travel for our students, travel for our teachers, the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6306.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She confers with other experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6308.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She might confer with other superintendents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6311.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's always going to be people who are going to disagree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6316.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's always going to be people, and luckily we've heard from some of them tonight, which is nice that you've taken the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6323.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who's going to support the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6325.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it's a simplification, obviously this is far more difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6329.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To the speaker who said you're not giving parents enough, well the problem is that this is a pandemic and all I can say to parents is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6338.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At any point, we need you to think about your backup plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6342.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure many of you, all of you, are thinking about that on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6347.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are in a circumstance that calls upon families to be flexible and nimble in the most difficult ways, which obviously none of us would possibly choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6362.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on saying all of that, I would support leaving the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6367.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I always feel that as a school committee member, ultimately, as I vote on the superintendent's contract, that is my probably most important role in so many ways besides making policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6380.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this superintendent, Dr. Marisa Edward-Vincent and her team have showed extraordinarily dedication and also have worked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6391.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very closely with the school committee to make sure that they are doing what we are asking of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6890.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7926.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to do the amendment first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7938.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7940.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the amendment, can we just lump them together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7943.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7944.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7946.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the amendments, member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7988.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Kathy, what was the original motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8080.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Continued authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8081.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8190.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's still giving authority to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8198.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But authority for what I think is what I'm trying to be clear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8202.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to determine whether the schools need to close or should remain open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8221.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8262.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're affirming the superintendent's authority too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8313.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that separating section two with section three makes any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8319.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that it's the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8325.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't understand my colleagues'<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8330.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, lack of clarity on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8331.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, to me, um, we're saying, yes, the superintendent is the one who's going to make the final call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8338.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're, we're saying the superintendent, the school committee is not going to be called into session to make, to make, to take the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8410.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's just an unreal place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8412.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, we have meetings every two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8417.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like this committee is just going to abdicate and walk off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8420.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have continued meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8423.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're talking about this at every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8429.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you're trying to define something so specifically is kind of losing the forest for the trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8437.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that's your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=764.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Alex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=765.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you for all your work with the special education pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=770.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, this is something that I've believed in very firmly and have been part of the discussions in the previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=778.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is the year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=781.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said that now, I think I'm going to turn it over to Joan and or Susanna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=787.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know who's going to take the lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1342.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1549.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Suzanne, can you tell me how many teachers took the course the first time and what your hope is for enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1608.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1611.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that this work that you've been doing is really excellent, you know, and I've loved seeing the lesson plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1620.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My only concern is it's possible that a student would go through eight grades and not happen to get any consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1634.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: discussion from year to year, depending on who this child's teachers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1877.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I might, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1881.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Susan, do you want to answer and then go to Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2151.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I had a question, um, the book that you cited, uh, from the teacher's lesson plan, out of my mind, is that a book that fifth graders, um, in most classes are reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2240.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, what I'm thinking is that, you know, again, it's wonderful the work you're doing today and the work you'll do in the next go round, but is there a way to, you know, suggest to other teachers who aren't participating at least to be looking at that lesson plan, which seems to be very comprehensive, so that maybe they'll be choosing that book too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2267.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to read in their classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2269.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, my concern is what you're doing is fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2274.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just is for those who either aren't participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2277.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I totally understand that this year is so, again, how do we get all the curriculum pieces in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2284.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's why it's so fantastic to be able to infuse it into the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2289.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm wondering how we can encourage all teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2294.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to be looking at those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2296.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering if we can identify a couple of lesson plans for each grade and send them out and just say, hey, FYI, this is one of the things that the district is really looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2307.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's some great lesson plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2310.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would think that for some of our teachers, they might be vastly relieved to have it laid out so clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2317.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'm trying to say, how do we ramp it up a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2325.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, and I'm looking into next year too, how are we making sure that we are hitting, that there's, I mean, there's multiple topics, not just one topic, but so many different topics effectively for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2340.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I bet there will be some teachers who would just absolutely shine at doing this, but if your kid is not in that class, that's what the problem is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2387.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2703.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And remember, we also just last month talked about the racial equity piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2710.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not just this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2712.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's multiple things that we're trying to provide comprehensive education for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2723.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have to talk a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2726.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maurice, I see superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2901.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was wondering whether any of the teachers who've participated before have been from the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2938.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, where I'm what I'm thinking is that, you know, as teachers are attending this they're also learning more about the disabilities that they students might have, particularly say, you know, a student on the spectrum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2958.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that that goes across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2960.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it may not be that the carpentry teacher in essence is really teaching or developing a unit, but also I guess there's another piece of saying, how do we make sure that our staff is knowledgeable about different disabilities that their students have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2982.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know how we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2984.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anybody wanna address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3069.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3071.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3072.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody else like to have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3075.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3077.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3078.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3125.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3127.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anybody else have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3130.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3169.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Alexia, that was exactly my question, is saying how will we follow up on this and then make sure that we're expanding on it in successive years and being able to also evaluate our success of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3189.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: implementing this curriculum or in our larger school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3196.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any thoughts on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3274.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many teachers are you thinking in terms of the pilot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3302.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I would think that it makes sense for this topic, again, that we touch back on it, either at the end of the year or definitely at the very beginning of next year, so we can see what happened and where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3320.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that seem, the pilot program was listed in the original presentation, was that from March to May?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3331.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3333.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can either add it on, perhaps, to our topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3336.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We do know how crazy June gets, but I think that we need to circle back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3342.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3425.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you say that, it also jogs me to be thinking that there are budget implications because we want to make sure that if there are particular books or units that people are excited about presenting, that they have the books or materials that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3445.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So doing this prior to budget so that we were knowledgeable about what we would need would be particularly good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3455.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3508.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3591.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so Jenny, would you like to make a motion that the school committee curriculum subcommittee receive a reconvene in June or prior to budget so that we can get an update and we can see what funding might be necessary to continue this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3616.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3620.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3620.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3660.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3662.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, will you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3666.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3670.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3674.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3675.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I think that we've really covered it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3678.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, thank you, Alex and Tanya.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3680.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there anything else that either of you would like to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3704.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3705.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3706.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3707.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you to both of you and to the work of the PAC over not just this year, but for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3713.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that includes Melanie, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3716.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3717.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just want to remind her we have a meeting in December off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3723.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to say it's December 11 December 10, I believe, 10, so it's a 10 so close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3729.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3729.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we were going to look at addicts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3733.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3737.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3737.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're looking at mathematics in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3739.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We will again continue to let everybody here know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3743.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So now this may be unprecedented, but, and Melanie, I know that you've had maybe a slightly shorter meeting, but I am going to ask whether we have a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3761.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That means that we have actually accomplished something we have yet to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3766.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are having a shorter meeting than called for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3768.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's because everybody was so well prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3772.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=104.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=280.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that I particularly want to bring to the attention of the committee at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1411.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so the ramp, as I understand it, was put in to assist loading and unloading, particularly of the musical instruments and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1421.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was never meant to be ADA accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1425.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you recall, there is an ADA accessible ramp at the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1430.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My safety concerns, though, is that because it is there, that it opens us up to concern automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1440.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As you think about it, there is no railing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1443.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I come out of the building at night from a concert, I have been concerned on many an occasion that someone could make a misstep in the lowered light, even though we've improved lighting there, but it'd be highly possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1458.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's for anybody, not only somebody who might also use the ramp, which might have some concerns, maybe wheelchair, whatever, it's clearly too steep for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: safe wheelchair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but that is not the designated ADA ramp, but it exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1481.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, it was put in for, you know, all of a sudden it appeared and there was a reason for its appearance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1487.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But for me personally, from the time it's gone in, I've been concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1499.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're at the front of the building, and you're looking at the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1502.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the ramp is, part of it is stairs, but the ramp is right there on the left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1512.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, it's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1516.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1517.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you've probably been up and down it 1,000 times, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1540.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, it's not so much an accessibility issue as my concern about what if someone makes a misstep off the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6474.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we have a blanket permission slip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6476.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we have one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6478.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just go over those, that again, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6513.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if parents opt out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6531.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that will be confidential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6536.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm just saying that the teacher will know who opts out and not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6565.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7450.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just going to say that it seems, you know, Mr. Rousseau is presenting certain information that Tony's unaware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7457.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that needs to be a private conversation between the two of them if information wants to be shared so that she can verify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7466.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at this point, it's only, you know, working on hearsay, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7476.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7479.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I just, I'm not privy to the details of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7484.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: None of us are, except perhaps the two of you, and somehow or another, it doesn't seem like it's really moving us ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7493.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like there's some will to have further discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7497.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a hard time because I know I'm not an expert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7501.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know I'm a school committee member who has great intentions and wanna do the best for our kids, but I'm not an expert on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7508.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that means that I have to listen to experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7511.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in some places I'm a little worried because I feel like some perhaps of my fellow school committee members think that they can interpret things in a better way than some of the experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7523.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7525.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm feeling a little uncomfortable about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7528.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we do need to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7529.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're going to have a meeting on it, where the potential would be maybe next Monday, if I threw out a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7538.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know what the will of the entire committee is at this point about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7543.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm definitely feeling uncertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7546.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand arguments that I'm hearing, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7551.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, what are the major question is, I've heard some things about metrics and looking into how Tufts changes us, our potential numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7562.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly, Mr. Rousseau is saying that the current policy that we have is not accurate and needs to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7570.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the same time, I heard the superintendent say something about that it was being updated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9212.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sure that behind each one of these, there's many more stories that could be told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9216.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's nice, especially when we have this kind of meeting, which has had its difficult points to then have this bright side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9229.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10727.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I wanted to go back to the elementary portion and ask specifically two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10734.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, we talked a great deal about the Columbus second grade and bringing in a second teacher because of the unique circumstances that had happened, but I don't see that reflected in a split or have we brought in a second teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10759.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10760.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are they working in unison or have each taken a portion of the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10790.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, especially as the students had begun, that actually makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10796.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Has the feedback from parents and students been positive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10802.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So far, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10803.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10805.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question I had, and I just wanted to refer to it, is at the time when we discussed it two weeks ago, I had brought up the issue that you referenced that needing to change<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10816.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some of the specialists, and I was quite concerned about that because I know for my own grandchild how important those specialists are to him, and were they changed, it would cause him great stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10831.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was very concerned when I had received some emails about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10836.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One in particular stood out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10839.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't received any out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10843.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: input after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10844.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hoping that means that the new specialists have quickly, the kids have quickly adjusted, but that was something that was unexpected and I'm not totally sure whether it was, I know it hadn't been communicated to us, so I didn't understand it was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10861.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we stable at this point with the specialists and are you getting any other feedback about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10921.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10922.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know, you know, in my own, obviously, I don't think it's the ideal situation by any, you know, stretch, but I think that what I'm hearing is really it's what you had to do in very unfortunate circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10937.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I keep on putting that, trying to put that into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10940.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, today we had to, we were asked to submit videos for, to the McGlynn for their Medford Pride Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10948.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, words I had to use was flexible and proud of our students for being flexible, because I think that's such a key here and something that we have to keep on patting them on the back for, and also to our teachers and staff too about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10966.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: striving to keep that flexibility as we work through these times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10974.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11011.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, that's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11014.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2201.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2206.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3465.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3468.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I was just curious whether we've been able to go yet to the next level and find out, say, with the 38 students, is that 22 families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3479.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there multiple siblings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3482.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we been able to look at the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3487.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would think that would be the next step and say if it hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3587.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's very valuable information for us to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3591.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I know, it must have been very time consuming to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3594.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it really gives us a good picture about where we're standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3598.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it also reassures us as committee members of knowing that all of this outreach and touch has happened in a very clear way that we can see on these tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3609.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It really sums it up nicely for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3612.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate it very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6469.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to first, Tonya and Alex, I want to thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6473.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it was very, very interesting to read through all the responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6476.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, they kind of fell to me in two different categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6481.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was the level that was heartbreaking when people just said, I'm struggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6486.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm having a really tough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6487.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, at one point, I just felt like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6490.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tears coming to my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6491.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was sort of thinking of parents really in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6495.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I also had a second feeling and that was there were many responses which really spoke to the dedication of our teachers and the positive interactions that had happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6506.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And locally there's a child not far from where I live who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6513.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is in an out placement and I've spoken to his father and he has said so many wonderful things about the people who he interacts with for his special ed child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=6527.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really think that was brought home in the survey as well and want to thank our teachers for their dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7606.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7607.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7609.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I had a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7611.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, could you please remind us, Peter, was this translated into a variety of languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7617.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And did we get any ones that were translated back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7651.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, my second question, or really just a comment, Peter, is on the slide where you ask about how much time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7659.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a little misleading because you're, in terms of helpfulness, because it's K to 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7668.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what my expectation might be for a high school student is very different than a kindergarten student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7674.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So were we to do it again, if we could break it down at least into elementary, middle, and high school, for me, that would make more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7684.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But otherwise, I certainly appreciated the information and that you did this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7719.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing which would be interesting, especially in the upper grades and perhaps middle school too, is at some point to ask kids how they're feeling and to return, you know, to see what kind of feedback we get from students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=7734.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8397.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had received several letters as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8400.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we all did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8402.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we all feel the same way, the same as Peter and Paul have just conveyed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8409.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's important that we will celebrate this class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8411.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It'll be the most unique and different sort, perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8416.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's things we don't know now, but certainly it's not if, it's really a question of when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8423.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8423.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8923.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this is slightly off topic, but I haven't heard any updates about the advanced placement exams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8932.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have those exams at this point been canceled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=8977.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9372.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be appropriate to add one to the new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9376.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9377.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9378.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9379.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to just mention, of course, that this is the sad, um, you know, today the Boston marathon was supposed to be run and I wanted to certainly remember, uh, Crystal Campbell, uh, this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9392.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9392.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9478.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9479.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to let you know that on Wednesday, I went up to sign the bills, and I'm standing outside the high school down on the main road was a whole lot of our vocational teachers and other staff from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9496.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: holding signs to honor Annie Glenn Cross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9500.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was so, so touching and moving to see our teachers making this effort, knowing that it was such an unusual time, that it was different for the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=9511.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And yet they had gathered together appropriately, social distance, but showing their love for Annie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=292.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to let everybody know that I was in on Wednesday to sign the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=301.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now I'm signing the bills on a bi-weekly basis, so I go in every other week until I hear any, until I'm given any other instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=313.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am proceeding with and very thankful for our great people who are coming in to work to get the bills ready for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=323.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=491.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=493.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I read through it and I was comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=496.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that our administrative people also thought that it was workable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=540.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you to the subcommittee, and I'd like to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1164.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1166.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to say thank you to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1168.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1169.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine's worked very difficult and in a very demanding job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1175.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to say almost a thankless job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1178.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to thank her for her work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1182.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: dedication to her position, and I'd like to wish her well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1185.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's certainly understandable that not driving quite as far as she drives, which is way too long, and being close to her daughter, even though it's going to be difficult to find someone in this very difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1200.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But thank you, Kirsteen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1202.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3080.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this was discussed at the curriculum subcommittee and the subcommittee voted to bring it forth with a positive endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3091.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we didn't have the paperwork at the time, so that was given to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3095.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that we go ahead with the adoption of the new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3100.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as a reminder, if any parents have concerns, they can opt their students out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3106.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But from what I hear, most more people are interested in making sure that their children have this valuable information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3719.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3721.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3722.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at the same time, the bus company, like all of those athletic trips that we would be taking now, we are not paying for, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3732.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3733.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3734.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to make a motion that we authorize you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4031.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4033.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, member Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4042.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the number of potential subcommittees we might be having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4046.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this time, while we're under crisis, that we need to not have them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4052.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know how many requests people have put in to have them, but I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4056.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we do need to limit the amount we're asking of our administrators until we get back to normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think my concern is the number of subcommittee meetings, and I have no idea how many requests there were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4197.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so maybe I can just ask if the superintendent keep us abreast at how many are being asked for, because I just want to keep it real and appropriate for this particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4213.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, you guys know I love going to subcommittee meetings, but it depends on, this is an unusual time and I think people are already taxed, so I want to make sure we're being smart about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5054.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Including our grocery store workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=921.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there's been some frustrations with working out your student enrollment in the music programs in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=934.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What are you looking at for next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=936.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because you mentioned some frustrations this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1566.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that the two requests for the two additional faculty were not included in that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1573.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that, just remind me because I don't remember since our last budget meeting, if anybody else had made requests for additional personnel, were they not included in the baseline budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1600.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In any department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1602.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=1602.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2477.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2480.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Given the, can you tell us, Molly, what was the number of Chromebooks given out to students so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2489.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2493.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So given that that many has come out and will take a certain amount of use and abuse, is there, and also just understanding, even with that amount given out, there might really be more need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2511.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2516.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we really okay with the numbers that we've got right now, or is it just very conservative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=2607.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What does one cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5420.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5425.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we pick one of the areas that we want to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5428.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5430.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5431.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of time by, or, you know, you said June 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5436.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we say June, hold it out a little bit longer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5443.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 15th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5443.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're running out of daylight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5444.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, I'm certainly willing to, you know, I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5453.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that we wanted to put the budget meetings before the other meetings, and I know that there's a lot of planning time, but we could consider doing a different night as well, or time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5463.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to work out, I hear the administration saying, oh my God, we've got so much to do, and I hear your need of saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5472.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to see more in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5475.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we have discussed, and I think we will discuss some of it in depth, but I'm trying to look for a place that might be a little more amenable to administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5485.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we push it out, Christine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5598.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that's necessarily real right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5606.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5611.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5613.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know what is public and not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5723.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would concur that I've certainly heard the information before that it's not that this information was withheld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5728.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's just the update on the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5730.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in previous years, we also waited because the accounts were not finished off yet to a later date in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5741.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I certainly would endorse what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5744.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5746.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, we can certainly shoot for October 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5750.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I think, um, if so we can take the vote and move on now, um, that that would be our objective would be, would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a7nti5izX0Y&t=5758.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, and we'll, um, you know, all things considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=195.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=196.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2353.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just was curious whether we've had any discussions with the Japanese Language School in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2361.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know in previous years, or over the years, they've sometimes been able to work out something where perhaps they would, in fact, pay for the – continue to make their payments this year, of course impacting that next year, then they would – that would be offset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2379.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But have we had any discussions yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2416.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would just be hopeful that we might have a conversation with them and at least negotiate somewhat better terms for us because it's a large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2480.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I continue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2484.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the question that many of us will have has to do with classes of employees who work for some of the revolving accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2495.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know if you want to address that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2497.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's one of the most important things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2521.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Until that time, since it's been put off another week, is everybody being paid in the afterschool and program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2554.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Kids Corner employees will be- Everybody, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=2558.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3649.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this is the time of year where there are various other activities that entail contracts, for example, for the junior and senior prom, perhaps for some of the senior activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3661.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Has that money already been paid out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3665.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like, let's take one of the proms, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3668.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that just so that we don't, so our students don't lose that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3675.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are we in the process around those type of expenses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3728.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3729.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think she can hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=3738.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6733.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I, too, would like to thank everybody for all of their hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6736.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that so much time you've put together to put together this information for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6745.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's very much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6749.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, in this first two weeks, it's been hard to understand what the consistency across the district is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6757.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had some wonderful conversations with very happy parents about the information their students were getting, and so very, very positive feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6769.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what I don't know was how consistent that was, and whether there were some students who weren't having as good as opportunities as others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6780.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, this obviously now takes this to a different level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6784.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my first questions is, is we have lost time, and was there any discussion about what we're gonna do during April vacation had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6799.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No answers, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6802.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, everybody's just assuming April vacation is going to be a no work time, or are we going to reflect on the fact that we've just lost two weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6814.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some degrees, how are we going to look at that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6816.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: People aren't going anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6817.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kids are going to be home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6837.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something that's going to need to be considered and you know personally I would just hope even if the activities didn't continue that week that there would be you know a list of things for kids to do because if they're going to be home at least have them some level of direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6856.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you know I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6859.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: just wondering about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6861.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do realize that this, you know, it's been a recent now that closed till May 4th, you know, and who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6869.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6870.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't know about the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6874.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Other questions I had, are teachers coming in to assemble packets of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6879.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned that, you know, we don't want it to be all, is anybody coming into our schools or are they just assembling them at home if they're sending out any information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6978.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I- Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6979.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Caldwell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7032.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are basically at a stay at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7036.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wouldn't want to jeopardize our teachers in any way, safe words, but I'm asking the question because I don't think, I don't want parents to think that they're necessarily gonna get a packet of information in the mail because I think for many, that's really not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7052.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I wanted the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7054.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My last sort of topic right now is on guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7059.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the time period where many of our seniors are receiving, if they haven't already, acceptances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7067.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There will be some kids who are going to need last-minute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7070.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh my gosh, I need another recommendation or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7074.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I've just somewhat interested in what guidance is doing and how we're making sure that all of our students, particularly our seniors, are receiving the help that they need during this critical period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7185.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any idea about applications for the scholarships, the end of year scholarships, which usually are coming in around beginning now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7214.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=7217.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9919.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to inquire about our homeless students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9923.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we done any outreach to the students who are in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9927.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have we given them any support in particular?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=9932.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And who's in charge of doing so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10326.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I looked at this and again, I realized that part of it is because of the school vacation week, but I feel very uncomfortable that we would have a meeting on the 13th and then not again to the 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10343.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think it's really important that we add a meeting on the 27th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10348.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't need a full agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10351.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: meeting, but I need an opportunity where we are brought together and we can talk and ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10357.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10360.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's a long gap and I'm just not comfortable with, this was a very, very long two weeks that your members had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10369.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we know you were working really hard and we appreciate that, but in our role, that was an extraordinarily long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10376.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when I see that just by chance, and I understand that this is the way it would have been under our regular meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10384.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But under this circumstance, I'm just not comfortable with that amount of time between our meetings, especially because, you know, May 4th, we may be starting school again, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10521.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the only reason I didn't suggest the 20th was because of the fact that it is during that school vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10532.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10534.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So which of course in today and doesn't exist anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10537.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just mentioning that again, the sense of we have a difference in terms of and this certainly was discussed over these last two weeks in terms of the school committees need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10551.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to be able to talk to each other without having the full agenda, without having the, you know, because I understand and appreciate how much work this meeting is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10562.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we set it up so that we have a touch base opportunity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10656.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like my colleagues to weigh in some, and I would like, you know, some concern about the 20th was vacation week so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10663.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're comfortable, you know, in this one, I'd give to Marisa and say the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10668.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just seems very difficult to have a meeting on the 13th and not again to the 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10903.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just would like to ask the administrative people whether they're OK with the 20th as opposed to the 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11181.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11183.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that you, Janine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11184.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't do as early as 3.30, but I could do 4, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11189.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11189.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 4 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=646.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the curriculum subcommittee met on Wednesday, February 26, between 4.30 and 5.30 at the superintendent's conference room in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=655.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In attendance were the subcommittee members, myself and Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=660.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia was absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=661.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee member Paul Rousseau<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=664.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: attended the meeting, as did Superintendent Maryse Edward-Vincent, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of PE Health Rachel Puri, and Middle School Parent Michelle Ciccolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=682.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I called the meeting together at 435 and we saluted the flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=686.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The purpose of the meeting was to review proposed additions to the middle school health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=691.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received handouts from Rachel Puri, including the table of contents for the national health standards and a table reviewing the current Medford health curriculum with the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=701.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Areas where we were not in alignment were highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=704.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Puri reviewed the charts with the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=707.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Currently we use part of the Michigan model, but now we should be incorporating more areas of the most recent Michigan model edition to cover areas related to sexual health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=718.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are covering areas such as vaping, alcohol, drug education, nutrition, physical activity, safety, and other areas of social emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=726.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Currently, the state standards are not out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=729.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at present, we need to rely on the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=732.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Perry explained the health is offered for a half year in grade six, seventh, and eighth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=737.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other half of the year, the students receive instruction from guidance in order to cover the new areas of instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=743.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In order to cover the new areas of instruction, one full-time health teacher will be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=750.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham asked about the trade-off between students receiving health versus the ability to participate in band or orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=758.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Parent Ciccolo noted that her child had no health in sixth grade because of a conflict with orchestra,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=763.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In seventh grade, her child traded phys ed in order to get health instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=767.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee member Rousseau noted that often students on IEPs miss subjects like health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=773.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing said that our kids are under a constant bombardment on vaping and other risky behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=780.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He believes a trained health professional is of highest priority, a must have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=785.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Guiding staff not trained to teach these health areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=789.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent concurred and noted that budget decisions are going to be tough because of the many needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=794.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since the new curriculum covers areas related to sex education, such as gender identity, anatomy, puberty, and contraception, all parents will receive the opt-out notification, which the district has used for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=807.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The sequencing of the curriculum will be given careful consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=810.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The high school ninth grade health class will be reviewed and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=814.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Scheduling at the middle school is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=816.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham offered the following statement to summarize our current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=821.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We recognize that there are scheduling issues that mean parents have to make choices that we would rather they did not have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=828.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are very aware of the issues and are working to address them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=832.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=835.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Curriculum Subcommittee recommends that the school committee adopt Growing Up and Staying Healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements in order to assure that we are aligned with the national health standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=848.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call was Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=850.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=853.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn at 5.30 by Member Graham and seconded by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=858.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the motion passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=860.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we would like to make a motion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=864.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We would ask that the school committee adopt, recommendation is that we adopt growing up, the subcommittee recommendation is that we adopt growing up and staying healthy, the Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there were resources that the teachers would be using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=909.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were not specified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=911.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we did address the needs of the fact that there was concerns about getting the curriculum to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=918.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's one of the reasons why the recommendation is to add a full-time health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=924.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: teacher at that level, because we need to be more comprehensive in our ability to deliver the information to students, all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1084.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I correct in saying when it's tabled, it's tabled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1089.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1092.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1101.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1102.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: »» Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: »» The reason I motioned to table it was because a member asked for additional information that I did not provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1112.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because typically when we've had a handout we don't always provide it that's not customary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1117.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't provide it and since a member asked for that information and we didn't provide it, that's why I made the motion to lay it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1157.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, if I may, there's also a budget piece of getting a, whether we're going to approve the additional health personnel, which is going to make this possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1168.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I absolutely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1171.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that as soon as a member requests a piece of information, I mean, the mayor just said, I don't feel comfortable voting on it unless I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1179.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so, uh, it would be as you and I both being on the subcommittee, we very, very much want to see this go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1186.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1187.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I'm willing to wait for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1189.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would not have to read the minutes again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1191.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We would just have to bring it back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1197.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll lay it on the table to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1201.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1391.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to ask for suspension of, oh, sorry, not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1395.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1623.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1626.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1629.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also, I guess my first question is, did the subcommittee endorse, I don't see a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1638.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there, sorry, where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1646.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And was it a three to one vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1649.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or a three to zero vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1650.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1652.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have a question about, okay, here, I see it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1656.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1661.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It appears that it gives the superintendent or her designee within two normal school days to respond with the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1673.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, when I'm up there signing the bills on Wednesday, I have to say that my observation is that people are running, running, running, juggling so many balls in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1685.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think two normal school days is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1688.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand everybody thinks that whatever they have, as do I, is the most pressing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1695.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I don't think that's real to hold the superintendent to, and I don't want her to be under pressure to simply<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1703.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: designating something to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1705.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then sometimes she may need to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1708.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't find two days to be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1712.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would ask the superintendent, since this affects you directly, is what sort of timeline you would think would be reasonable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2331.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2333.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, so first I want to say I do appreciate the work that the subcommittee did on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2338.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent has indicated her willingness to try it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2343.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern, again, just stands, perhaps I would change it to three normal school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2349.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to work through my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2350.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, it's written on Sunday, it gets sent so it's received Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2354.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That means the expectation is that it would get answered by Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2358.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: afternoon, but all hell breaks out loose on Monday and Tuesday they're running about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2363.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, again, part of me just, I absolutely understand, you know, what the intent is and I think we are all reasonable people, but I'm always concerned when we write policy like this that someone then could come along and be holding, hold the superintendent to something that we agreed would be flexible and we're trying out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2388.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, to me, it just seems very quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2392.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd be more comfortable with a three-day return, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2398.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would go, certainly, with asking the rest of the school committee whether, you know, I'll make a motion that the response within three normal school days as opposed to two, and you either vote up or down, and I'm happy to take whatever the consensus is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2415.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I make a motion, if anybody wants to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2417.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, approve it or second it, that'd be three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2423.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2857.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm also very glad that you acknowledged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2861.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so much that the district has made grave strides in these last months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2867.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2870.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I take that one and we can make a copy and send it back to you maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2874.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2875.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2875.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2942.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3337.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3339.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also wanted to add my thanks Diane and not only for all of your years but I have to emphasize for the last two years because you really were the constant in the office who helped us through the transition of superintendents and that was just an incredibly important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3356.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: role for you to play and you know you could have looked around and said oh I don't think so but instead you chose to stay and to be the transition link and so I think for that not only for that but also for your many years back I remember when you were teaching at the Curtis Tufts and I always thought you were something special so thank you very very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4535.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4540.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'd like to go back and talk about the coronavirus more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4545.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I'm particularly interested in is our proactive plans to talk about education if we were to have to close the schools for a week or two or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4559.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, at this point, I understand it's speculative, but I think planning would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4607.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, I'd love to see homework packets put together, you know, and if possible, or even, you know, read with your child two times for 20 minutes every day or something while whatever break we're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4632.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other concern I have, just with that, that goes hand in hand, is that some of our students are reliant on two meals a day through the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4644.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at least, like I'm thinking at the high school level, we've got the pantry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4649.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: could those students be encouraged to take more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4652.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the pantry needs more food, could you put a call out to the community so we can fill it up right now so that there's more food available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4661.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm thinking about other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4663.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, all of a sudden, you know, we have students who would be home and not accessing our food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4667.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we make sure that we're being proactive and thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4671.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: supplying some food to families that might be in a particular vulnerable place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4680.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I'm glad to hear the administrators are getting together tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4684.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4731.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm hoping that we will do this, send home information so that we don't get to a Monday morning and all of a sudden cancel and the kids haven't received anything on Friday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5457.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to something my colleague said that there would be our teachers and staff and whatever would continue on their regular pay scale as per contract whether we close or not that that would not affect our personnel in terms of being paid and it I'm not sure that's what you said but that's what it sounded like okay just want to be clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5510.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The blessing is right now is that we have quite a number of days still left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5515.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because of the light snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5518.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But saying that, I probably, there was a year, so I won't say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5963.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So did all of the students buy the cancel for any reason insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5969.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5970.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this point in the time window, do I understand they'll only get 50% back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we've had no talks with the company to say whether that could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6024.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So within that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6028.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of the airfare, some airlines are allowing waves or will give credit for future trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6036.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What were you planning on flying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6068.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that we could look into that, because it's quite a hit for a family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6072.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it's a disappointment for students, and I feel terrible about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6077.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so anything that we can at least get the most money back for the families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6084.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: thought or discussion of saying, could we do the trip during the summer instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6240.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6242.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can feel your pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6243.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really appreciate your thoughtful answer and the fact that you had to make this tough decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6250.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9285.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe I can concur with Melanie on many of the points that she makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9294.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9295.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It never was a reasonable timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9298.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems ludicrous that they're asking for such a quick return across the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9303.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My mom used to say, it never hurts to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9306.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think putting together a well-crafted letter saying we would respectfully ask you for more time, we don't believe that this is an adequate amount of time for us to engage our families and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9318.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I would absolutely submit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9320.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would actually go further and talk to the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9323.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: superintendents who are also grappling with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9325.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe there's a few who've managed to figure it out, but I bet there's a whole lot of superintendents trying to slam this together, as we will be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9335.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm not willing to leave money on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9339.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think we need to go ahead and send it to the engagement committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9343.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to write the letter because nothing ventured, nothing gained, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9347.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That we should do that and hope for the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9351.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, do whatever work we can do so that we are prepared to file what we have, whether it's perfect or not, because I'm not going to leave $138,000 on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9362.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can think of many, many different things that we've talked in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9367.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that might be helpful to our students and to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9372.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9373.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of clarification, member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9390.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we don't submit the plan we automatically still get the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2837.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What would you like to suspend the rules for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2840.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, because this is going to take some time to read it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2843.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2844.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules so we can pick up the two departments that were not heard yet from our pre budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=2855.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3599.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3600.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3603.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Seary, I just want to go back to the issue of the ninth grade biology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3608.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So of course, as you know, for many, many years, biology was the ninth grade subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3613.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, the physics was changed to the ninth grade subject because of the fact that the students needed to take a ninth grade<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3624.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: science MCAS and it was thought that the physics was more approachable maybe or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3632.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I'm glad to see biology coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3635.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it fits well in the ninth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3637.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think all students should be able to take it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3639.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I am wondering about the change of thinking about will the students then take the biology MCAS in ninth grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3653.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and so will our teachers who were teaching biology in an upper grade now come teach it to ninth graders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3664.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And will the physics<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3669.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will there still be that introductory physics, or will physics be left?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3739.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we have any earth science course at all offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3766.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this change will happen in September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3770.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: September 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3772.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's with relatively quick, but I imagine that your staff is all on board for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=3777.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4615.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So with the change in the Italian consulate covering the money for the paraprofessionals, I think that we need to have a discussion about how we will use that time, whether we'll continue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4635.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as we are or whether there's something else that's needed in the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4642.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know how much time people have yet from the administrative have been able to consider the options and what might be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=4651.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would make a motion to send this topic to the curriculum subcommittee meeting once people are ready to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5853.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5854.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, my questions are concerning the students left behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5861.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tucci, you noted that the kids, you were thinking of a trip to the Medford High School swimming pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5868.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that the same thought for the Andrews students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5889.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I understand that for many students, maybe going to the high school pool is great, but not all students know how to swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5897.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of me says going to New York City for the weekend versus going to the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5903.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that students used to go into Boston or have something outside of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5910.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just sort of curious about that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5942.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For kids who either didn't know how to swim or was there a swimming assessment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5947.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How did how did we handle that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5965.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I absolutely can understand that it would be great, and if it is great, I wouldn't want to change it, but I certainly feel like I need to ask about it, because it is, you know, it's just not as great as going to New York City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5979.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: no matter how much we might love the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5981.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6001.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on that motion, Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6163.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If the trip needs to be canceled at the last minute for any reason, what is the policy regarding a refund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6201.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I'm at it, for the New York trip, if there was a cancellation, is there insurance to cover that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6213.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought we required that there would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6228.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You are talking to the person whose child was in the grade when the trip was canceled and they stayed at the Medford Hotel rather than being able to go to New York City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6237.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a little concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6242.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just check into it and maybe we'll talk, clarify?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6247.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6247.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=6249.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8705.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I realize that it is somewhat amusing that the Curriculum Subcommittee, which will speak to ECRI, has not yet been reported out yet, only because of the suspensions that we've had this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8717.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we will get to it and explain a little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8721.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in the notes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8726.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First results were given to parents for grade one and two in November, and then kindergarten parents have now, they've all received some results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8737.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm curious whether initially we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8741.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: surprised at the number of kids, or it was what we expected, or no, it was lower than we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8747.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was sort of curious about your initial reactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8750.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I'm wondering if we have supports to help students right away who were red flagged in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8851.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8852.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how about what you're seeing initially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8894.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then lastly, where then becomes the line where we determine that a student is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8903.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is dyslexic or severely dyslexic so that they need more than classroom supports, but they need a specialized, maybe special education support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8969.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8971.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=8971.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11286.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess sort of remembering the discussion last year with all good intentions that we would want to provide instruction to people, because as Member Graham says, it's an incredible responsibility and there's a lot of reporting things that you need to do when all of a sudden you're the treasurer and you need to make sure you're following all the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11308.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in fact, what I see, and I think Paul has just touched on it, is that right now we notice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11315.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, our people are working hard, and they're pretty tapped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11319.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know how we can possibly ask someone within to pursue this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11329.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I think that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11331.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's worthwhile to talk to the MASC and ask them whether any of their member districts, what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11336.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might reach out to some other school committees and see whether they give any training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11343.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if there's something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11344.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that already exists would be so much more preferable than having to spend any time putting something together, even if that would be a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11505.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11506.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11507.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll reach out to the MASC and at least ask the question there of whether they know of any training, whether that's a voice where we can get a message out saying, hey, does your school system do something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11521.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that at least we can start sort of saying, is there anything around that we could adopt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11530.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll do that first piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11532.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11720.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I'm going to make this the short version because of the long hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11726.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you've heard ECRI being referred to any number of times this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11743.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell welcomed everybody and she explained that there would be, on March 3rd, a half day of professional development session conducted by Hill for literacy and professional development would continue next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11765.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: ECRI materials consist of downloadable PDFs for classroom instruction and full district implementation is expected to occur at the beginning of next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11777.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received two handouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11780.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa spoke about ECRI as a multi-tiered program, Tier 1 and Tier 2, featuring a series of teaching routines designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of reading instruction in K-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11795.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The program is being introduced to improve student achievement in word reading and comprehension, fluency, and phonological awareness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11804.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tier one of the program is whole group instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11806.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tier two is targeted intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11809.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our teacher, Kristen Howell, title one at the Columbus, worked with ECRIB this past summer through a grant in conjunction with DESE and spoke highly of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11818.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also at our meeting, Michelle Donahue, a Medford resident and a teacher in another district,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11823.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: spoke to her very positive experience with ECRI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11826.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Her district uses a different reading program than Medford's journeys, but they have the same concerns about foundational weaknesses that we are seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11835.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11835.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Donaghy brought her teaching materials and explained facets of the day-to-day implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11840.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She sees it as something that easily fit into her current teaching and bolstered her students' understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11846.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham asked when the Journeys Program would be evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11850.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A discussion about the complexity of implementing all the new curriculum pieces followed, and we covered that some in our budget meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11858.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Keyes explained that it was essential not to overwhelm teachers while other new curriculums were being adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11866.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kloot asked Director Teixeira whether ECRI program would be useful for EL, and he explained he responded in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11875.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Parent Sharon Hayes expressed some concerns with Journey's approach to the teaching of combination letter sounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11881.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane Caldwell noted that the cost of ECRI is $275 per level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11885.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The combined cost came to $3,300, and the cost would be covered by Title I funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11892.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The motion was accepted, was made to accept ECRI, was made by myself and seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11898.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Stone, and the motion passed three to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11901.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The chair asked about upcoming topics, and we have a list, elementary, ELA, and math, suggestion to create the overall map of the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11910.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We reviewed, we suggested we talk about civic standards in fourth and eighth grade, the amount of assessments, possibly reviewing elementary Italian program, and win assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11922.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we adjourned at 6.59 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11926.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to add to this and announce that we have another curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday at 4.30, between 4.30 and 5.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11937.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The purpose is to discuss proposed changes to the middle school health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11941.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll be meeting this week again, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11947.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It will be up at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11949.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11950.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be appropriate for the school committee to endorse the adoption of ECRI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=11960.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the proposed adoption of ECRI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=955.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1840.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think my colleagues have summed up many of the discussion points, but I feel particularly disheartened to hear from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1846.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Donlon that any student felt that they were getting negative feedback because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1853.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to say, and add my voice, that I applaud you for coming forward and for advocating for yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1859.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That is exactly what we want you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1861.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're appreciative of your time and presence here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2173.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we heard from students involved in the after school program, we have other students who work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2179.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it would only be equitable to understand the full breadth of student employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2186.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, we have students who are lifeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2188.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's part of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2894.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have several things to bring to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2897.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At our last school committee meeting, Member McLaughlin asked, and it was reflected in our minutes, about the conversations with non-English speaking families from the health office, and we talked about a translation service that were used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2916.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I pulled one of the bills so that you could see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2920.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to note that the names that are on it are not student names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2923.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They are, in fact, the employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2925.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I thought you would just be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2927.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can see that sometimes the conference is only two minutes, and sometimes it's 14 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2933.571s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this is that we employ a service to help with the translation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2938.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I brought that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2939.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pass them around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2940.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would ask that they all, they are copies, but if you just return them to me, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2945.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Secondarily, and this is kind of an ode to my former colleague, our former colleague, Erinda Benedetto, I pulled a bill that was for professional cleaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2957.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whenever I see professional odor remediation services that piqued my interest so I followed it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2964.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It had to do with the Curtis-Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2966.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They had a problem in the library classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2970.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on December 26th, when students were not in the building, they brought in ServPro to help remediate that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2979.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so you'll see that bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2983.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I just thought you might be interested that we have received new textbooks for our students for our civic education in grade 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2991.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I brought in the bills for you to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2993.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, much to my dismay, I realized that they are already out of date as I couldn't help but look under impeach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3001.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it mentioned that only, you know, two presidents have been impeached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3006.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, we are obviously, our teachers are going to have to update that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3011.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is also a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3012.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I brought them in just so you could see and know that these resources have been brought to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3018.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3038.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One further thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3040.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to extend again an invitation to any other member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5946.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one thing in the timeline that doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5950.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I note that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form is due on March 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5957.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the open houses, the three of them occur after that deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5964.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for me, it would make more sense for the sibling opt-in, opt-out form to be sent home, to be due on March 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6040.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, with... If it would work such that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6047.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is not a drop-dead, but which is to say that instead they'd be collected with the ideal on March 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6054.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if there were forms that were not turned in, there would be follow-up with the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6060.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would be comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6064.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's a procedural thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6066.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If it's meant that if the parent doesn't return the form by that date,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6072.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: then I'm not particular, you know, one way or the other, then I'm not particularly comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6077.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I assume you'd be following up with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6089.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6090.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can make that, that makes them more comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6095.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7998.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8004.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8006.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like where we're heading is that we're going to need to do some specialized preschool information directed to preschool parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8016.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Especially, we have the Medford Family Network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8019.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have parents we can outreach to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8022.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know one year I went and I was very disheartened by how many of those parents, it just happened that year, were going to charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8033.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it seems like with the feedback from my colleagues that it's definitely time to think about an earlier outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8042.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that these presentations are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8044.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know the staff does a fabulous job on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8048.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But clearly, we're going to need to think about sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8053.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9562.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so thank you for all the work to the team who's been putting and working on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9568.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just for our clarity, I believe my understanding is that for each of the bullets, you'd hyperlink to a page that would outline in detail the steps needed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9581.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to achieve and the person in charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9587.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the bullets that we have here, roughly 16, 17, how many have we done that next step for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9596.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is that the next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9692.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can just follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9693.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Moving forward, what do you envision now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9696.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you envision it going to the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9816.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11294.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, now that we've officially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11297.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're promoted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11298.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11310.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, given that we are now official, I'd like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11317.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Announce that the curriculum subcommittee is going to meet on Wednesday at 6 o'clock between 6 and 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11325.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are meeting at the request of associate superintendent Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11331.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for a presentation on enhanced core reading instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11337.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did the unusual step of going ahead and setting up the meeting prior to sending it to the subcommittee officially from this body because of a timeline issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11348.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I hope that no one has any concern or objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11352.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that will be on this Wednesday, February 5th at 6 o'clock up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11359.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11360.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, while we're under this, I noticed that we haven't yet received any appointees to the vision committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11367.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to ask the mayor what her intention was about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11393.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11394.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11848.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanna make sure, this is one of those circumstances where we have a meeting immediately after a vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11861.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so given that timeline, is that meeting the best meeting to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11871.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you prepared at that point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11894.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I only raise it only because of the fact it is right after, and you know, some people are on vacation, but not all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11901.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you, and I would support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11904.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11905.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11972.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the point of sending it to the subcommittee is so you can argue it out there about saying what makes sense to send, what's an ad hoc report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11985.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and does something like this qualify and how do you discern?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11989.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's kind of my thinking about it is that there'll be multiple interesting discussions about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12000.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why it's going to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12006.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not this resolution, what she's referring to with the ad hoc report, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12013.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, future resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12019.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you're going to have to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=213.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some weeks are heavier than other weeks, so you never know in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=217.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But please, if you would like to join me this Wednesday, let me know, just so I have a heads up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=223.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I certainly think it's a valuable experience, so please do so when you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3674.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the bathrooms were part of that plan, if I recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3678.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might want to take that out again, take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3682.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had anticipated that there would be certain monies available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3686.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and just so that we're on track and consistent with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3691.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we may need to revisit it, of course, but the bathrooms were certainly an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3695.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then secondarily, I also want this really falls, there's the sort of short-term immediacy of the issue, but there is the long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3705.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And from our subcommittee on buildings and grounds led by Kathy Kreatz, we made a motion that we would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3713.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have a larger committee put together appointed by the mayor to look into the high school renovations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3721.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I know it's your first day, but that obviously is something that this falls underneath because how much money are we going to invest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3730.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the long term plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3732.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What makes sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3733.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, John, we need all of your efforts right now to make sure that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3737.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: they're as presentable as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3738.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3739.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we need to invest some short-term money, but there is a long-term issue as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6437.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6902.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we're through the 10 pages of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6908.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6909.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we let Mr. Russo finish his questions, and then I've got a question on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6915.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6997.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Christina, I wanted to go back to your main report and on the back you noted we drew down from the following accounts as identified during the FY19 budget development progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7008.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7009.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand you might not have with them tonight, but can you tell me from the after school program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7014.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: how much money was used to offset other programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7030.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the before school, do you have those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7035.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7046.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7093.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so really the major one really is the before and after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7096.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7097.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of about a half a million dollars that is used to offset other accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7104.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so it's less than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7105.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7106.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, it still leaves us the question of saying is that what we want with the tuitions and how else can we, should our budget be expanded so it really reflects real costs rather than the need to do creative fundraising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2481.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2481.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2483.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Zigny and the students, we thank you so much for coming and gracing our halls again this evening as you have for so many years past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2490.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sort of sets the tone for us and you know how much we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2494.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you that I and some of my colleagues were able to make some of the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2502.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: performances this holiday season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2505.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I recall, that's not your first standing ovation for the orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2509.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The orchestra concert was so great that people were blown away in the audience and everybody stood at the end, which doesn't often happen at a student performance like this, but it really was a testament to the work and dedication, both of our students and to their fabulous teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2525.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2525.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Merry Christmas or happy holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2539.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, parents, for bringing the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2929.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree that limiting the goals was in fact an excellent plan and really gave focus to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2935.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And rest assured, we certainly will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2939.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: making sure that the work continues and will be focused and will continue along the lines, the trajectory that you started us on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2946.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Erin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2993.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, I would like to make a motion to suspend the order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2997.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to take superintendent's updates and comments at the end of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3001.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: calendar, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3423.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've always been there for us and one of the things is that so often we are just in sync with our thinking and it's absolutely a pleasure and I thought this is such a great time to recognize the work that you do not only for the Student Opportunities Act<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3443.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3445.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, we're going to need your continued work and to advocate for us to make sure, you know, there's those dirty words, subject to appropriation, and we want to make sure that, in fact, where the places are, we can maximize the benefit for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3462.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3464.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was hoping that we could all do a picture with your bells in front here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3469.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So take them out again, and let's ring the bell for education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3588.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3642.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3642.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Item three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3867.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could we please send letters of thanks to Noah and the other students as well as anybody else who took part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3876.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The veterans on behalf from the school committee, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3880.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4348.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to comment because I was a colleague of Lena's for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4353.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Lena was a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4357.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My most wonderful memory was when Lena, in her high heels, because Lena was always dressed to the T, and I climbed to every roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4367.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is when the Osgoode was still standing, so we're talking many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4371.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We climbed to the top of every roof and examined them ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4375.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4377.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the schools were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4378.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was way before that, as a matter of fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4381.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Lena was going to never let anything stop her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4385.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought Lena would have been so happy in her own right because, you know, it's a Monday and Lena is being waked tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4392.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I went to the wake earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4394.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she used to love when the music played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4396.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Lena was, we didn't always agree, but Lena was passionate about education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4406.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we send our heartfelt condolences to her family and memories of the many years that she decked these halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4528.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4534.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a few words to say, which is traditional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4538.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's always a bittersweet moment when we come to this place and we recognize the work of our fellow colleagues, but also know that change is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4548.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Michael, you and I stood out together this election day, all day, from the beginning of the day to the end of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4557.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there was no way that I was going to let you leave one minute before me and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4562.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we had a wonderful time talking and chatting with each other and I thought, boy, what a benefit this was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4568.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And during that time, I really appreciated as I talked to you and heard what a passionate dad you are to your two wonderful sons and a husband to your lovely wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4580.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was, you brought a breath of fresh air to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4583.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not every day that we have a blueberry farmer amongst us, and that was something that I think was always interesting to your colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4591.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We always want to know more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4592.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to that end, tonight I'm bringing you Mr. Ashley's blueberries, which happened to be on sale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4598.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the school committee conference, I kid you not, I couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4602.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is a lovely, lovely book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4605.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I am sure that you're going to enjoy reading it to your young sons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4610.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Michael, I think this is hardly the last that we're going to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4613.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your time here has been relatively brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4616.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think that you've probably, I certainly was enriched by your presence and I hope that you've enjoyed your stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4624.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suspect very, very much that we will hear more from you in the future and that you will continue your outspoken passion for education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4634.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, Michael, as you talked about reelection, you mentioned your concern about the obesity epidemic for children, and that, of course, brings into it also the concerns about exercise and recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4646.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so as one of the members who is continuing on, I promise you that I will take up that mantle and continue it so that your work and thoughts in that direction will be continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4657.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Michael, thank you so much for your tenure, for being here, and for being one of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4662.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aaron.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4664.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4667.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Erin, I can't believe that eight years have passed because it seems like just yesterday that you joined our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4674.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm having a hard time with that processing that really you've been on the committee eight years, and I'm probably having an even harder time believing that you're leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4685.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank you, too, for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4687.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's not only just you, but also we got to meet and become friends with your wonderful husband, Joe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4696.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We heard about Caitlin and Joey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4699.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We lived just through one wedding and know that there's another wedding upcoming and house buying and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4704.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remember them when they were so much younger, and you were, sorry, younger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4711.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: active parent, well I'm older so it's okay, active parent, a band parent, I remember all your work for the prom dress and mostly I think that your work for the Curtis Tufts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4724.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: keeping that school in vision, in mind, saying, how are we going to approve it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4729.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need new shades, we need the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4731.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just each meeting, we wondered what else you would come up with because you were intent of making sure that that work would be done, just as you were with the special education subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4742.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your tenacity, your thoughtfulness, we didn't always agree, but within that, we certainly had a level of respect with each other, and that's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4755.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4756.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Erin, I too believe, like Michael, that you will continue on and be very active in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4763.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure exactly how that's going to turn out, which direction you're going to go in, but I know that it will be one that you will work very hard at as you find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4775.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: your passion and I also believe strongly that you are not over for education and that we will see you here in these halls again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4783.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Erin, thank you for your dedication and your time and your commitment to the children of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4855.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I now want to turn to Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4861.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who has been a fantastic mayor for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4865.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But more importantly for us, for this contingent, for these people sitting here, you have been a fantastic chair of the Medford School Committee, and we thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4876.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not been the easiest of four years, but your accomplishments have been great, and you have ruled with steadfast<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4890.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The time, and I know that you've said it, but more was seeing you with the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4893.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know how much you loved going to the schools and seeing and being with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4898.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And believe me, you'll always be welcome in our halls because you have a natural ability with the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4905.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was just wonderful to see that piece of you, which I hadn't known before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4911.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But your accomplishments, of course, are bigger, although we have to recognize that one of the key things of your administration is that we made a transfer from a very longstanding superintendent, Mr. Belson, and made a commitment to a search<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4929.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to be open, to be inclusive, and we, under your direction, we were able to identify and bring in Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4940.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly think that you should keep that as high on your accomplishment list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4945.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not to mention, by the way, I drove by the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4951.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: police building going up and I saw the light shining and of course I also have the luxury of driving past the library renovation which will also have your fingerprints on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4967.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4976.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We appreciate so much that, I mean I can't say enough, but that sense of professionalism of keeping what is important for the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4987.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we proceed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4988.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we move on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4990.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and through and make the best for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4996.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5093.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe we have some other people in the house who also wanted to recognize the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5097.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5098.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you want me to do the... Whichever way if you want to do those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5102.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't want to forget at the last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5237.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was vice president of the photo club in high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5244.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5268.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You guys should come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1145.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much Writers of those letters from the school committee members thanking them for weighing in on behalf of our students I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3294.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I'll start at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3295.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank you, Michael and Rich, for coming tonight and for updating us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3300.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, we know what a positive thing this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3303.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I've been sitting here and reading some of the other projects that happened at the elementary level, something else occurred to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3310.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first, at the elementary level, I happened to look in my book and one was teal pumpkin awareness for letting the community know more about the teal pumpkins means on Halloween, that there are non-food items available in case kids have allergies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3328.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And another one, you know, more books for little free libraries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3332.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We see the little free libraries<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3334.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: popping up, but not enough kids books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3336.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3337.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And all of a sudden, as I was thinking about this, I was thinking, because of course, we know what fantastic high school projects we've had and how wonderful you just represented yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3348.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But when I go to the music concerts, one of the things I'm always struck about is how when people, students get up at that spring concert,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3358.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They often thank the music teachers because it is the music teachers who have continuity from the elementary to the middle to the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3368.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what we've now managed to build with the CCSR is that there's a continuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3375.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of ideals going from the elementary to the middle to the high school and soon because of this while the time the kids get to the high school of course we'll always be welcoming more new high school students but we'll also be building the space that will come up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3391.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's an incredibly powerful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3394.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm very appreciative of the success that we've had and the building that we've done over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3401.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did just want to mention to Marie, I read an article, I believe it was the Boston Globe, just a week or so ago, talking about how difficult it was that while our students from less<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3415.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Students perhaps who come from families who were their first time college students, while they might get into college, it's difficult for them to stay into college and they're not necessarily prepared for all of the challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3428.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And laying that base now for them to be able to talk to college students is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3434.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of the projects we heard tonight were wonderful and I can't wait to hear about all the other ones that will be happening from all the levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3441.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3853.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your voice is extremely important, and I am so glad we are finally getting this student voice back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4363.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say the exact same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4365.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you, Molly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4520.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to make sure that a letter is sent on behalf of the school committee to Mr. Hoff and family for their, at this time, thanking them for the incredibly generous donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4702.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention that I'm grateful that Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson put in the grant for this, because this is money that certainly can be used and will be very practical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4717.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my thanks to her, and I'm glad we're going to be able to go forward with upgrading some of our equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4725.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6621.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to say my colleagues have done a wonderful job of covering the basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6625.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to go a little bit further, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6628.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Erwin, with yours, I would like to make a motion that we receive a financial report about the after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6636.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, I want to know what income comes out, what our expenses are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6640.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to know what staff are paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6642.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want it to be as thorough and clear so that the committee really understands what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6649.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, I believe that some of the money that we took in was used for other expenses in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6655.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to take a look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6657.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm concerned because obviously staffing is an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6662.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we mentioned the high school rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6665.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I totally understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6669.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said you have $14 for an assistant group leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6671.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, anybody can go to Whole Foods now and start at $15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6678.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is not a position which comes with benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6682.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so it may be a position that even though we may be competitive with other after school programs, the fact of the matter is that if maybe we have to be better than competitive, maybe we have to be the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6698.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My little grandson goes to after school care in another state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6701.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I worried about availability and asked my daughter, are you going to get in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6706.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is he going to get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6708.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She said, Mom, every parent is guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6710.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to have after-school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6712.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's where we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6714.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6715.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be every parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6717.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at the same time, we need our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6719.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, my experience and my past with some after-school is it can be pretty tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6725.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was impressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6726.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like my colleague Kathy, I went to go visit the after-school program, and I was amazed at how calmly and efficiently and caringly it was run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6737.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was really proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6739.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to see how wonderful our staff members were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6742.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm concerned if they're stretched, if all of a sudden they have to cover<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6746.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: two classrooms if they have to cover more because someone's out sick or someone has left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6751.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the questions we have to raise is we don't need to want to be going every single year to start out at the beginning of the year being understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6761.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is there incentives that we can put in to keep people with us so that it's not just, you know, a short-term job but in fact something that people will commit themselves to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6771.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, you pay different money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6775.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the hospital, there are certain jobs where when you're on the more difficult shifts, you get more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6782.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're not getting benefits for a shift for a job like this, then I think you need to factor that in into the hourly pay raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6791.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think the time has come that we really need to look at the finances to understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6796.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think I appreciate your report very much, Megan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6799.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6800.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking for step two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8432.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, like my colleague, I've thought about this, and what he just said was sort of on key, that these, this plan is really for the purposes of evaluating the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8444.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think many of the school committee members, and I know that as we just went through this election, many of us said, we need a strategic plan for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8452.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that wasn't limited to, I mean, this is very focused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8457.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe that we need to take a look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8460.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the district and set a strategic plan, and maybe we should call it the school committee strategic plan as opposed to the superintendent's strategic plan, to take a look at all the factors and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8470.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where do we want to be in three years, in five years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8475.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is our projection?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8476.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's a different type of strategic plan than this evaluation piece, which is obviously moving us forward and specifically geared to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8492.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: mathematics instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8494.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm sure that with my colleagues we'll be doing that and we should be talking about what type of meetings we want to set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8503.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that those kind of discussions work within a regular school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8508.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would be more important to take a look at a different venue and to really lay out some time and see what the vision is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8518.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll certainly, and I know that many other of my colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8522.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we're thinking that way as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8748.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8750.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to, we had a legal matter today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8756.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that we would be going into an executive session, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8765.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=8768.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that quite a number of people have been brought on after the start of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1443.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, for example, let's just use the paraprofessionals that have been brought on, say, in October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1448.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one October 8th, one October 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1451.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second one, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1453.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at the beginning of the school, we have many new employee induction programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1462.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: people are hired and have a later arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1466.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we making sure that they are up to date on all of the information they need to or would have gotten had they been hired in an earlier time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1506.509s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have some sort of check-off list to make sure, for example, that everybody is aware of our emergency plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1521.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I think we need to follow that through at some point, so thank you for that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1527.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question is, I noticed cheerfully that we have hired quite a few people in the after-school program, and I would like to ask for a update on the after-school program at a meeting in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1550.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thirdly, one last, I understand we have a teacher out, a science teacher out and at, oh I think it's the Andrews 8th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1561.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and parents were concerned about who was going to replace the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1568.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Dr. Maurice, you and I corresponded about this, saying that right now it was a certified teacher, but not certified in science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1579.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, is are we seeking a certified<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1582.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: science teacher to replace that, because I think that there is concern, especially given that the students had a teacher, the same group of students had a teacher out last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1593.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's two years in a row that they would be having a non, or I don't know who took the place last year, but I do know right now that we have a person in there who may be terrific, I don't know, but is not certified in science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you provide us with an update on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1657.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also again, because of the concern, I would like to ask that, you know, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1663.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the new teacher be monitored carefully just to make sure that he or she is doing whatever they're supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1673.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5484.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5485.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, just as a comment, I think that my initial reading of this was I was almost a little disappointed, and people have touched on this, that we weren't doing the DIBLS 8 at one of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5497.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because just from a kind of common sense place of where we're sitting is, oh, that means that we're testing different assessment tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5508.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and getting an idea of how they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5510.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did read carefully your sentence that you put in here about saying that you guys have truly looked at both of them and saw them to be comparable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5521.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but that's, you know, it's kind of almost a common sense that my initial reaction was saying, oh wait, they're not doing DIBLS-8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5528.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I thought we should be because we should be looking at all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5531.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thing is we were passing around the colored<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5535.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: places, pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5537.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I wanted to know what you do for a child who's colorblind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5541.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you first assess whether they're colorblind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5552.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and with those, the students, the idea is how fast the students can read those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5580.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5581.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And a student who's coming in who has been speaking a different language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5607.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And my last comment really is, and this really comes from speaking to my own daughter recently, recently, and the whole question of dyslexic, and she is dyslexic and was not identified until really till older in high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5626.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But she said to me, well, mom, of course we should have known because I was always in the low reading group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5631.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and made clear the pain of being stigmatized in the low reading group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5639.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And here we're talking a lot about taking students and determining what they know can do and not, but it also opens up and raises the concern of saying that those kids then are grouped together as the poor readers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5653.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I don't know how we're doing that today, but Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5738.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one last, because you brought it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5739.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the interesting things about my daughter, she can read on a computer screen much, much easier than she can read on a page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5746.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So how do we differentiate when we're giving a computer test for those kids for her who might struggle with the written page?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6700.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6701.759s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The increase, say, between the last year and this new year one, do you know what that is approximately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6709.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's roughly 4%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6724.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6725.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7062.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To my colleague, it would make more sense for you to make the motion that prior to the next implementation or prior to the next time contract that we do a study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7075.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because to do it in December, well now, then another two and three quarter years are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7082.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the information will be current, but if you make the motion that prior to the next time we go out to renew the contract, we do that cost analysis between in-house and out-house or outside, that would make much more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7098.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could ask you to reword it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7130.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7130.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7131.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing I just want to remind my colleague is that, while I understand that it sounds great to say, well, we want to give Medford people jobs, this company may be employing Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7145.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know who the employees are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7147.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know that there were multiple employees who have already worked for the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7153.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so to just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7158.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While it may sound great, that statement may sound great, I think it's superficial because the fact of the matter is that there are probably people, I know that we have gotten good feedback on the employees, and I'd hate to just put them out of work because we had some other thought of, oh, Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7176.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, maybe they are Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7179.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a little more complex than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7183.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1566.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I did attend the meeting because I was the one who had sent it from the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1572.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And originally, we had sent it to a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1574.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then on request, we sent it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1577.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the Policy Subcommittee, but I'm not a member, so I wanted to attend, so I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1582.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing that I think was clear from the meeting was that many of the policies that we have posted on the website<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1592.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as Benford Public Schools need to be reviewed and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1595.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That at this time that they were over time, since we originally did it and we worked very, very hard to have it done originally, but it was not updated periodically as we changed policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1609.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know exactly when we're gonna get to that, but I believe that it's probably your committee, Kathy, that wants to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1681.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have been meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1682.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1684.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know how time consuming it is, because I was part of the original putting them together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1688.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, as they're updated, they should be brought to the school committee for their review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1692.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1710.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1710.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1715.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't understand that your plan was to review every policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1719.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what I'm suggesting that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1721.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly, we're on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1722.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1723.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2410.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2411.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2411.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2413.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, too, just wanted to add my thanks to both of you, and I particularly appreciated, as I read the part about sort of revamping the DARE education to now fit within the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2427.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That includes vaping education as well, and I think that's something that we're all concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2434.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was really glad to see that that was articulated in here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2439.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think it's a wonderful idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2440.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that I used to run lunch bunches, and I know how valuable they can be for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2447.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a little bit relaxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2448.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2450.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And having a police officer as a friendly face in the room, I think, is a wonderful idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2455.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2805.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, I was wondering if you could let the school committee know when the next PFLAG presentation will happen at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2813.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would it be possible for us to attend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2815.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that something that would be OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2819.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2827.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it would be OK if we attended?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2830.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3652.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank you, too, for your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3655.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was curious a little bit just about the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3660.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it sounds like we need more parking spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3663.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that because more students are driving to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3701.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which is the area for student parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=659.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to know him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=660.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=661.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's nothing new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=662.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're so excited over the years watching you grow and your family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=666.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=672.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been so great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=674.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=683.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=685.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much, Joseph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1660.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1661.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought about this a lot, and because I was disappointed that students who really would have liked to have gone to the March<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1672.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: didn't go because they would have adversely affected their team because they're not allowed to take part in those activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1682.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But to me, while there was a question of timing, it happened quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1688.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We only knew about it, or I only knew about it the day before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1692.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, this is a school committee policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1696.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to me, I feel like the administrative people probably are doing their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1702.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I have to step in and say, this is a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1705.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to look at the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1707.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that students should be penalized for attending a climate change march.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1713.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd love it to be an educational opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1716.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would even consider some sort of, I mean, I agree with Paul that that distinction between excused and unexcused, perhaps we need to talk about that overall because I've had parents come to me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1730.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with frustration about that policy in the bigger sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1736.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because they say, you know, my kid was sick, but not so sick that they needed to go to the doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1741.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just put aside over to the left and say, we have a bigger question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1747.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do believe it's a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1750.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion that the school committee meet to discuss the absentee policy, especially in regards to outside events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1760.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that students would like to participate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1762.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that if we can sit down around the table and come to a better way to handle this, that this would be better for our students, and then we wouldn't be putting our administrators, you know, holding them up with annoyance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1779.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2557.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear that by asking to send this to the policy committee, it's not because in any way that I agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2564.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't agree with the choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2566.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just because I'm taking the power that we have as school committee members, and that is to make and set policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2573.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's the way that we can go about it and craft what we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2578.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: will agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2580.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also just want to mention in all of this, the one thing that I kept on thinking about was that lovely young lady that came to us last spring, wanting to bring to our attention her frustration with the styrofoam trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2593.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think now it's September, and I know we're working on it, but yet it doesn't feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2605.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we're really concerned enough, because if we're concerned enough, then price wouldn't be a matter, and we would get reusable trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2612.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was at Tufts yesterday, at the Tufts Community Day, and I noticed all the plates were, they're recycled paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2619.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm concerned that our own body isn't feeling the pressure enough, that we're gonna get to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2631.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but we're not getting to it fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2634.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it's up to us when we have a student like this, and we all agreed, we all agreed what we should do, that we should make it happen, not wait until it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2699.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It may be trickier than you think because the excused and unexcused, I mean, I'm not sure that matters as much as, and I don't think we can go back and unfortunately change the fact that the real issue was they couldn't participate in their extracurriculars if they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2726.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what is at the real meat of this, is that that's what the problem was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2735.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2739.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just as I try to think about this and I may need some help from the administration here of saying we could ask students if they went to the climate change on Friday, I guess that's how we would identify who went as opposed to who was sick or who was whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2757.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2759.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we kind of need to look at our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2761.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not against it, Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2763.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just not quite sure how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2766.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could, it doesn't have to be decided tonight, we could go to that policy, the policy subcommittee and we could discuss it there and it could be retroactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2776.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would that be okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3778.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I commend Kathy for volunteering to be the chair, and she may very well end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3783.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In previous times when we did, I was on both the Building the Future 1 and Building the Future 2, and part of the much larger community group that was on it, the mayor appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3794.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is typical, in my experience on the school committee, is that the mayor appoints who's going to be on a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3800.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as we did with the superintendent search,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3803.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We asked the community who was interested in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4276.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that I was up at Tufts and I saw Diane Caldwell giving out these bookmarks that had been made by our Graphic Arts Department, a nice little PR piece, and I wanted to express my appreciation to Diane for sitting in the sun, as well as I believe Lisa was there earlier, Lisa Evangelista, and also to the CCSR students who were present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4300.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a hot day, but very, very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6997.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to ask you about the grade implementation, because on one it says K to 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7004.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we doing K to 2 students in all the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7013.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when we, is this a one-on-one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7066.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at some point, if it's possible, once they get a little bit of practice, I think it would be great if school committee members who are available could go and watch an implementation, see what a child is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=421.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine, I'm only mentioning this just so that in your records it doesn't cause you a problem down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=428.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've got a typo on page 10 of 17, Greater Boston League.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=432.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be G-R-E-A rather than A-E.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=447.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=451.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2391.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tower, thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2393.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, I didn't catch, I heard Red Bones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2396.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2397.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I didn't hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2397.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford Brewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2399.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Medford Brewing Company will be supplying the liquor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2402.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2402.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2403.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2405.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, well it's a liquor permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2406.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2407.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's beer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2411.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2413.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My guess is if you're advertising that, you'll expect to get more than 300 people, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2423.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The 27th is a Sunday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2426.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So weather dependent on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2432.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you registered beforehand anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2434.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2435.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a walkers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2437.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2479.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2480.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2480.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3116.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3116.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3118.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to comment that I agree with Erin that I was under the impression that we weren't just doing a pilot program at one elementary school, but that the will of the school committee was to be very aggressive in moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3134.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was some question about which would be the tool that we used, but I certainly, I wasn't thinking that we were just doing a pilot program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3146.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At one school, I thought it would be that we certainly would be even if it wasn't at the beginning of the year, but it would that certainly at the very in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3156.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was my recollection that the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3159.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: really was very clear that we wanted an aggressive effort on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3164.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll throw that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3165.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll look through my notes and see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3224.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A parent approached me with concerns about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3240.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She wondered what the kids were receiving to eat, because her child had come home and reported something that was concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3248.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She thought perhaps two should agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3251.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we just wanted to be clear on what the breakfast program is providing to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3257.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll absolutely do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3258.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3272.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4542.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4542.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4544.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a clarification then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4546.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So each of the projects that we put in the capital plan from now on will be brought forth one by one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4569.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have an understanding of when that would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4573.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the CPC process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4587.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So no possible, we're not moving forward on any of the playgrounds till next spring, even though they were in year two of our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4596.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we, you know, I guess part of me thought that we're just going out to bond for money come into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4619.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was at the Columbus School for the Welcome to Kindergarten students, and though I've been there many times looking at the playground surface, I was truly taken aback at how bad it had gotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4635.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was thinking that we were going to be able to be moving on these much sooner than now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4641.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Money coming up in the spring, and we all know what that means, is the projects aren't really going to happen maybe until next summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4648.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, I just think it's, I mean, at some point there's a question of what is the safety level of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4655.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4656.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been a good number of years that they're there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4659.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're not meant to last forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4661.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4663.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so quite honestly, I'm really disappointed that we're not moving more aggressively on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4667.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand that there's these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4670.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess part of me feels like, well, we ought to have a plan B. We ought to be thinking of a plan B now in case we don't get funded for all of those plan grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4699.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5378.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to follow up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5379.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5380.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that I noted in particular with the compressors, that was a big ticket item and I see a lot of them got done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5386.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5388.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing which I noticed on this list is how much of this, you know, it's stuff that people can't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5396.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It needs to be done, but it's not visible stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5398.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5399.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not paint and wax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5400.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's just, I'm making a point because it's important to realize that this is thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, all of which needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5407.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5408.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you can't really even see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5409.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's the infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5410.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thanks again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5557.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5557.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Conwell, do we have any students who are here for medical treatment who might be adversely affected by the federal government's move not to continue their immigration status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5576.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not to my knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5577.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5578.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there are, would you let us know only so we can advocate for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5581.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5585.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you never let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5586.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if they had come to you, it was just a great concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7664.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to nominate Paul Rousseau to be our delegate at the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3857.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I would think that it seems to me that there is a leap of faith here, to some extent, by going with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3866.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we have the statistics between two of our schools, and someone answered about a bus being late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3874.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm sure hoping that the principal who's meeting that bus that is late is the caring individual who we know that they are and who will usher that it's not a, you know, all of a sudden breakfast is going to close and the door is closed and there's no chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3891.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I was a guidance Councilor over in Everett, there was a child who consistently came late to school and we knew had no food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3901.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to tell you, we always managed to get that child food by going down to the kitchen, by getting help, and we had no breakfast program at that time set up for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3910.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there are caring individuals in our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3913.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure that there are other people in our buildings who want to make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3917.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm betting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3919.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to bet on that and vote for approval of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3923.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then see, we might have kinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3926.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3927.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have to revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3928.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm at least willing to try it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3930.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's where I'll come down tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4127.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, well I'll speak to this for just a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4130.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's indeed wonderful to see how well Superintendent Maurice-Edouard Vincent has done this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4137.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The fact that she got unanimous support and that we all recognize that this has been a very strong first year for her and she's got such potential for growing from where she's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4150.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's truly been a great year to be able to work with her and be able to, for all of us to recognize this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4158.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4159.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4162.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4163.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4163.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have something we have to do before the end, just with the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4172.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine's very concerned, so that's why I wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4178.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, we haven't approved the budget yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2260.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, by the way, I love these trips for students in these opportunities I do also one of the things that the school committee worried about previously Is that the list would be given to the school nurse to find out whether there is any special?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2282.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2283.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2284.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4371.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4373.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to underline, I think, that this real accomplishment this year, and it certainly was so great to hear about, was the universal design for emergency preparedness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4384.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A real kudos for the CPAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4386.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5083.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy, Erin said it very well, so I don't want to take a lot of time, but I really want to thank you for all of your service to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5091.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've done a magnificent job working in a sometimes very difficult area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5096.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've kept the needs of the kids in the forefront, and I really appreciate having you here, and we wish you every good thing in your retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5455.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5456.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5457.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5460.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also received in our packet while we're on the topic of assessments,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5466.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a follow-up report on the universal dyslexic screening cost analysis, and that is not on our agenda specifically, although it certainly is an assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5476.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't thinking that tonight we would be debating which one we're going to do, but I'm assuming, and I just want you to confirm this, that our professionals will be looking at this and will be making a choice and will be part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5490.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it will be budgeted for in our upcoming school year budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5494.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5496.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5497.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5498.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6519.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would just like to add she also was my children's teacher and she went on and was a school committee member in her community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6526.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Peggy was a great person and it's a great loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=990.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much for your presentation, Jennifer, Zane, and Lila.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=995.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to tell you that this is actually not the first time it's come before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=999.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It came many years ago, I'm guessing 10, 15, and at the time we actually had trays but used Styrofoam plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1009.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at that point in time we did a cost analysis and it was determined that it was too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1015.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, now lots of years have passed and I am so happy you're bringing this to us again because it's not too expensive to save our earth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1024.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really appreciate you speaking up on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1028.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to need to ask for that we do a study in terms of what the cost of, what our options are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1037.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It may be an option to go back to reusable trays and water, but that, of course, also means expenditures using water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1045.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's many factors that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1048.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we're at a prime place now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1051.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We appreciate the work of our very young activists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1053.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's nothing that can bring it home like seeing that stack of trays and then understanding how that adds up over the course of a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1062.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you again for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1065.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make a motion that we send this question to committee and that we do a study and we report back by the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1674.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1675.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cheng and students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1678.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mr. Zigny, a lot of people ask me a lot of the time why I want to be on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1684.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I say to them, you know, it can be really rewarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1686.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they look at me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1688.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I want to tell you, it's really rewarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1690.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1826.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I failed to mention one other group that we want to express our appreciation and we didn't say thank you to the parents because the parents make sure that their kids are brought and picked up and from all the rehearsals and you know they're listening probably to the same piece of music many times sometimes and you know when you start in fourth grade it's a little rough at the beginning but my it's it's so worth it and thank you so very much for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1851.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: supporting your children in this endeavor, obviously it's so well worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8326.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8326.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8327.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first I want to thank the parents for being here this evening, and I also want to thank them for all the work and time they've invested into their schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8339.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Overall, I edited up, it was $143,000 worth of different activities, events, books, Chromebooks, things that were funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8351.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: by the PTOs or PTJ for their students and their schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8356.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's truly fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8358.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to mention the transportation issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8363.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The field trips are part of our negotiations with the bus company, which happens every three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8372.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is disheartening because that number always just goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8376.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's one of the reasons why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8377.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In some cases, it's better if an outside resource can come into your school rather than you busing the kids out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8385.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know, of course, that it's really great to give kids different perspectives and bus them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8391.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that one, we'll look again when we talk about our transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8396.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I think we've got one more year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8399.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8400.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we have one more year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8401.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that contract will come up in the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8405.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you do have a problem, and I trust that anybody who did would immediately report it, because I'm disheartened to hear about the issue like with Smolluck Farms, but that should immediately be brought to the attention of Christine Patterson, who will then follow it up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8423.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, thank you so much for all of your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8427.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do see some equity issues that were raised, and I think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8431.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: talk about them a little bit more in terms of the number of Chromebooks that the district has supplied versus the PTO has bought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8441.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because in some ways that seems like, gee, I think that's a district responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8446.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is one thing I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled that the elementary schools are working together and that you've formed this alliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8454.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, as the former head of the Medford Home and School Association, which lasted four years, and I'm a little concerned about the exclusivity only to elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8471.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: years go on quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8474.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I fear that by just containing it to just the elementary schools, that you're really writing off some of the most involved parents that have been part of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8484.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you might not think about it right now because maybe your child's only in third grade, but before you know it, they're going to be in sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8491.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why would you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8494.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: seek to exclude those parents who are very active or who might be very active or who have been very active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8502.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rather than limit it, I would prefer to see it grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8507.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I realize that for the different projects there might be different ways that maybe it's not equitable for the middle schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8515.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if they're part of it to receive as high an amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8519.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe on some other projects, they would be equal partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8522.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really think you need to give that some consideration and take a look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8526.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know it's probably a lengthy discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8528.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't do it all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8530.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm throwing out my two cents and saying, please don't limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8533.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please increase, become more inclusive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8536.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: not less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8537.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a wonderful, wonderful resource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8539.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have people talking to each other, which is just so great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8543.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, schools finding out which things worked at your school, which doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8547.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, the combined resources, that Disney project alone, what a great, great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8552.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are my two cents, and I hope to talk to you more about that at some other time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9546.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9546.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations, Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9548.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're very, very happy to have you move into the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9551.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're sad to lose Kathy, but we're delighted to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9555.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to say a few words?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9556.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10429.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10429.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10431.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, do students who would normally pay for their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10436.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: breakfast or lunch, would they be paying for their breakfast and lunch?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10451.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So how do we pay for that breakfast?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10455.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And will the federal reimbursements cover all of our costs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10473.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what's the downside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10492.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that it would be appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10494.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously, this sounds like it's great, but I think that it makes sense for you to sit down with our administrative people, one of whom, Christine, is standing behind you, unless you want to give us a recommendation right now or...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10509.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We said it would be short, that's my only concern here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10517.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11230.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm sort of caught here because I think that it's so clear, the message that this committee is sending is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11240.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students free<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11247.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to adopting provision 2, so to enable our students, the possibility of, all of our students, the possibility of free breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11258.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm reluctant to vote on it without having a report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11264.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's a courtesy to our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11267.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hear from Sarah that they wanted to report to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11273.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we could make the resolution, if my colleague was willing to withdraw his, to say that the members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students with nutritious breakfast options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11288.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to that end, they want to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11294.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: uh, project, uh, sorry, provision two, uh, breakfast model, um, uh, that we, and further that we are asking, uh, for a, a follow-up from administration at the meeting of June 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11321.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11322.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I said June 17th, that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12266.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the incentive for students to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12367.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: confirmed to be abstinent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12369.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I read it by urine test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12376.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so month one, abstinent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12379.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Month two, abstinent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12380.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Month three, failed the urine test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12383.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12385.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No payment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12399.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12399.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the incentive for a child... So what if a child has used marijuana once?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12406.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was a one-time thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12429.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like there's a fair amount of interaction with the students who participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12437.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12437.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when are they doing that interaction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12488.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For the purposes of this study, can we say, yes, we're interested in having our students participate, but we want to limit it to 9th to 12th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12498.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so we don't necessarily have to include the younger kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12502.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12525.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12525.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just wondering in terms of, say, rolling it out, whether you might start at one age group and then, you know, say, this is how it worked or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12536.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I just ask for this evening, what is... I don't think we're at the point of final approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12548.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems like there's a lot of details that need to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12554.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Superintendent, could you give us an idea what you would suggest would be the way to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14226.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14227.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first question is in terms of the two-day PD, are there two days in June scheduled for PD that are available, and this would be all middle school math teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14251.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, what will the other teachers be doing for PD during that time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14281.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14282.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, boy, I mean, that's just a lot of organization that needs to be done very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14286.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14287.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14287.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I recall when we discussed this, one of the things that I had thought as I was concerned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14294.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the issues is that we should buy some sets of classroom editions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14301.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I see the cost for books, one classroom set of student edition per teacher, and one teacher edition is $12,962.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14309.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that would be multiplied by what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14410.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to continue, the student editions are paperback, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15150.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15152.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not receive your letter, probably because you sent it to the school, and it never forwards to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15157.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pvanderkloot at gmail.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15160.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Works every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15161.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So look, if we do the extensive PD, and we talked about the need for PD, it's $15,350.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15171.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 12,962 buys us one set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15172.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, it seems to me that there's huge arguments in favor of doing a comprehensive middle school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15180.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We hear Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15182.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Irving's concerns and we respect her very much from years, if not decades,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15191.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15194.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay, I didn't even read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15196.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, one of the things that we haven't really quite understood overall is where we are in the comprehensive budget final number, because ultimately this comes down to a budget number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15210.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So one set of books and a teacher's edition comes to $12,962, but we're saying maybe we want more than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15221.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a teacher to have more than one set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15224.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's say we were willing to, if we had the money and we wanted to put, we're saying, look, this is so important, we're going to spend $75,000 on it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15233.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many books does that get us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15235.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have that money in our, is that possible for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15240.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the limit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15241.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I don't think we've answered that question yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15243.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know in our budget where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15249.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it becomes very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15251.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally believe that we should go forward, okay, but we should go forward with the maximum amount of professional development, that we should go forward with the maximum amount of resources for students that we can afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15265.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15266.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, that we don't want to set people up for failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=756.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the usual order of business so we can take up item number four, recognition of student achievements, humanities awards, today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2391.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would also like to thank the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2392.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to tell you that I wish that many years ago when my youngest, I didn't realize, we didn't know until much later that she was dyslexic, and it's actually impacted her whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2405.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2407.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would make sense for us to again suspend the order of business and go directly to the reports on dyslexia since we've now gotten into the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4196.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just was curious whether there is any indication that for preschoolers, I mean, is this something that can be seen even earlier for a parent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4213.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there particular sort of warning signs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4241.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question is the parent who came before us noted that her student had in fact been given some remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4248.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we figure out what's the best way to help a student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4255.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll go with the model that the student has been screened early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4258.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the approach that we're going to best meet the needs of a student who falls into that category?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4346.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Who do you think is doing a particularly good job, if we think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4351.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: districts you've worked with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4395.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7026.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I also would like to give a shout out to Nicole Chin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7030.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nicole was the CCSR student who really organized that dinner on Friday night, and she and her devoted parents did such a wonderful job pulling that event together, and I think everybody had a great time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7044.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was great to celebrate the students as well as to see those senior students who received $500 scholarships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7053.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was a great, great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7055.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to go back to the beginning where you talked about the middle school lottery, Superintendent, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7062.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7063.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I sort of have two different sort of series of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7067.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important to look back at the process and say what worked well, what didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7073.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so in reflecting on that, I was curious how much the outside CPA firm cost and whether it was worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7082.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we were to do it again, whether we would need an outside firm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was it worth it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we did it again, would we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7137.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I absolutely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7138.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to know, and it was important to create a baseline of making sure that it was transparent and clear and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7146.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But of course, having said that, I'm sure others have received, too, discussion from parents still asking, is there another way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7154.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it's important now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7156.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that in the time that you came in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7161.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and did a quick evaluation and say, this year this is the best way to do it, that we didn't really afford the timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7170.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think it's important now to take a step back and to say, is there another way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7176.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it make sense for all the 6th graders to be in one place and divide up the 7th or 8th grade class so that they all know each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7311.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I always feel the urge, though, as we discuss this, and I very much would like to see that feasibility study, and that's the reason why I'm bringing it up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7319.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it doesn't sound like I need to make a motion because it seems like it's clearly part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7324.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: your direction, but of course I want the school committee member to be very much involved with the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7329.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do, I always think that just from a historical perspective, it's very important that the community realize that the reason why we built the two schools in the way that we did was that because it enabled us to get 90% funding from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7345.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the cost of our buildings, these magnificent buildings, was a very small cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7352.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I always have listened to other districts and heard when someone came and talked to me today about what's going on in their district,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7358.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I said, well, how much is the state going to be able to contribute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7363.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7365.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was like 10%, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7367.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is why we ended up with the K to 8 in one building in the middle school, 6th, 7th, and 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7376.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But now many years have passed, and it's time to take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7414.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7415.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But did you get up and dance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7446.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7448.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7449.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7450.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Call it, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7453.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, you have to do it, it's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7454.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7466.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8298.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vendicott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8397.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I feel like I'm a little confused because I think we're mixing a lot of different things in that there's different issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8405.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, you're raising the question of the calendar scheduling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8410.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the tie-in was where is the money going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8415.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we have received<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8418.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: reports from Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8419.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8420.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was somewhere, I don't remember, back at some point or another, maybe it was a year ago, where we looked at it and we saw, and at that time no one had any questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8430.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was all detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8432.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe, you know, again, we should look at what date we did that and we should do it again on a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8438.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, I think that the motion at the time was that we would be doing it at a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8444.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's sort of in one pot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8447.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The report that we got today was on student activity accounts, which is different, but maybe we want them side to side with the friends of, so that we can say, gee, it's interesting, girls basketball, and I'm just picking one up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8463.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: out of the blue with, you know, has both a student activity account and it has this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8470.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It also is a friends of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8472.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because I think that's, Erin, what you're talking about is sort of saying, gee, there are some things that aren't listed here, which I thought they would come up with a student activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8481.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, a student activity account is different than what we talked about earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8486.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, I need to make some lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8488.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we, you know, when you throw it all into the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8492.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: motion, it doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8496.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8497.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, having said that, it's... Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8506.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I think about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8508.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to do it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8510.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8644.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8648.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To my colleague, I think it would make sense if we reviewed that in October as a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8653.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we need to make a motion right at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8656.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be my suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8711.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Resolutions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8713.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8827.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8828.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To executive session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have to vote for that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=793.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have a couple of different talks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=795.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one I mentioned, we did receive, or we're going to receive, a little while before about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=803.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that should be included in this capital plan because it was a piece of information we didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=810.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we can probably go ahead with the approval of the work of the committee of the whole now, but perhaps, you know, I'm still thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=819.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we add that to the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=821.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I end a meeting, you could... I think that while it was important to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=828.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Though, we are far from done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=831.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My colleague Mr. Ruggiero asked for, and I don't see it noted here, but there was also an ask for a report on things like how many compressors we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=843.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: water heaters, just so that we had a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=846.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when we started out, and it was four years ago, or three and a half in November, we really had gone through the schools and put together a comprehensive list, which I understand that Christine had told us that we are, you know, we've been hitting items on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=861.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the very end of the meeting, we talked about, we had a conversation that wandered into saying, you know, there's still a lot of people in our community who have grave concerns about the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=873.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's this question about what's functional and what's aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=880.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Many of us have long been concerned, just like City Hall down in Boston has the same type of architecture that our high school does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=889.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there anything that we can do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=891.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've actually never looked into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=896.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a paint that works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=898.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did comment that there is a building over in Arlington that used to look very much like our high school did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=906.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's the DSS building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=909.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they've made it look from externally, I'm talking externally, much, much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=917.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, the external factors for me, landscaping and making it look nicer that way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=922.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we actually need to do more exploration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=925.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had some discussions, some thoughts went out at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=931.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there's concern about having another subcommittee, because my initial desire would be saying, I think we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=941.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a working subcommittee of really members who are willing to do a little bit of, during, and I would suggest that we do it during the summer, doing some more research into some of these other questions around the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=957.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not putting together a motion right now because I want to talk to members to say, how should we do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=962.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we go forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=964.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we have to discuss these issues more thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=967.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and take a look at those concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=969.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I walked through the high school again, and you know, my biggest, you think about what is functional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=977.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm thinking about being functional as a school committee member and being what is my first impression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=986.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you do get kind of blind to what someone's first impression would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=992.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's certainly issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=995.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just going to put it on the table now to say to my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=999.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Colleagues, I think we only just began in that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1005.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not the first go-round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1006.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can assure you of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1008.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those discussions have been had comprehensively across the city about creating lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1013.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it is time that we look again so that we feel when we're looking at more capital improvements in the future, we will be going back to information that we've gathered at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1282.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had a discussion with the superintendent about the concerns about creating another subcommittee We have building and grounds so I think that that would probably be the place Place for us to to go to with this, but I think that if we could I don't know if we could look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1301.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know for me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1302.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: having, because we don't have a lot of other events and meetings during the summer, the summer would be a good time to spend some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1308.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if there were, if there was the will, that's what I think we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1312.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to send the topic, if I make a motion to send the topic to Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1336.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3365.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to support this and make a motion to approve the change of language so that our language department would now be called world language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3381.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that this was the right thing to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3383.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm also very excited that you brought this forward to us and said, hey, we should do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3387.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3389.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, sometimes we're just thinking this way, and then someone else comes in new and goes, oh, yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3394.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this was one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3395.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3396.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3733.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my concern is once we have an opinion like this, which clearly specifies, you know, the new four-inch power spring system is far superior<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3744.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: upgrading the spring floor system will be a night and day difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3748.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm so reminded of the young woman I once met who was a high school gymnast and she was practically had suffered many injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3759.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when I, I'm very concerned about the potential for injuries here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3763.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know we can say that forever, but we've now got the report here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3768.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to see this was not in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3771.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thinking when we did the capital plan, we just talked about a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3774.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about the potential of available money from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3779.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there were to be money, I think that we should either look for it to be in this current year, if there's any left over at the end of the year, once the books are settled, or be placed into year two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3793.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking, again, I'm no expert in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3797.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but I'm always concerned about the potential of injuries, and clearly there is any number of students or groups of students who use this, and so I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3808.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my motion is to look to see whether we can place this in the capital plan for either year one, and if not year one, then year two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3821.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To include it in the capital plan, either year one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3825.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or year two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3829.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3829.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it could be replaced prior to the fall competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3837.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3990.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can put it into our regular budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5808.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5808.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5810.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, thank you, Dr. Maurice Vincent, for the comprehensive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5816.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know how warmly the students have taken to you, and it's really great to see you with the students and with the staff out in the field, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5828.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's clearly so many different things in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5833.298s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things I did want to ask is that you mentioned that one of your key work underway is the launching of a district safety team to examine external reports and streamline safety policies, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5847.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would ask that the school committee, before the end of the school year, receive, and probably we need to do this because of sensitivity to security issues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5860.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we would receive a more comprehensive report from this team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5866.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, other than that, thank you very much for bringing us this report tonight, and I look forward to our future work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2776.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jasper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3480.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3482.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could remind me, Mr. Fallon, for the expenses for the students to travel to the next competition, how are we covering those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3509.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, we've had other students come before us, and my personal feeling is that these students are bringing the pride of Medford with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3519.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to see, again, if we could look towards a budget or perhaps, again, every so often the mayor's been able to come up with somebody who can cover the costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3528.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really believe that we should be building in some costs, that this automatically, we now have participation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3537.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in DECA and it would seem that we should build in a budget line item to cover costs for this because we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3547.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: optimistic about the success of our students, whether it be in this or the ethics team, and even before we talked about Albert's success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3556.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would make that as a recommendation in general now, but as we talk about in our budget meetings, I'm going to come back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3565.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, if we could look for funding, I'll put the request in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3569.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that you are successful, have been successful doing some fundraising, and I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3577.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We certainly appreciate that, but I'd also like to see the rest of the cost covered if at all possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4594.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4594.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4596.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Fallon, I just want to ask you, what space the new salon is going to be in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4661.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, and certainly in terms of access from the outside in the bistro, it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4691.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=4692.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4471.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I didn't have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4472.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just appreciate the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6842.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6844.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On page 5, one of the things I noticed, and you sort of did a side throwaway comment, was that, in fact, at the grade 4 level and grade 5, there really seems to be some struggle with fractions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6859.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6859.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you said, and I noticed this as a high school teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6863.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So part of that is, and I do see some of your action items do include remedial help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6870.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, it seems like that this is something that we might need to work into some regular classrooms just to make sure that our students really are getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6879.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So apart from the remedial MCAS sessions, is there possibility to bring this into the regular math classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6916.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6917.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The follow-up then also was on page 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6921.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For your future items, I see you wrote, adopt an inquiry-based mathematics program that will increase higher-level thinking for a more successful mathematics experience at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6932.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6932.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That seems to be a very important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6934.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering whether you're thinking that adoption would take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6939.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We haven't talked about it yet, so I'm not thinking you're suggesting this coming year, or are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7041.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7041.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that something you're going to be bringing to us during budget time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7047.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7048.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7048.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7049.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7050.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7051.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have yet to get this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7052.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7053.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7053.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we'll be on the lookout for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7055.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7055.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I want to bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7056.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7057.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I just wanted to mention that this Saturday I was driving in my car and I was listening to NPR and there was a TED Talk on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7064.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the TED Talk was on teaching mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7066.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the particular part that I happened to be listening to was the importance of struggle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7070.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, because I had the opportunity to go with the superintendent to do one of the walkthroughs in math, and that was one of the criteria that we looked at and that I saw and understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7083.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just thought that it was just a great thing then to be sitting and listening to the TED Talk about how we should be teaching math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7091.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9261.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9262.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kloop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9264.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rocco, thank you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9265.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am a little bit concerned and I just hope that the requests that members have made are not going to tie you up for hours and hours and hours to generate additional data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9276.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that a problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9285.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9286.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So sometimes I think that there's a problem wanting additional data, but also wanting to make sure that we're not tying up our professionals for doing the work that they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9297.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm a little concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9299.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But mostly exciting in your report was the suggestion that there was a middle school program that would build on what we have just adopted with the Amplify Science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9311.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I look forward to hearing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9313.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that possibly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9314.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could that be tried out next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9318.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that what you were suggesting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9361.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would that happen by the beginning of next September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9381.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think it's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9382.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can build on the momentum we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9385.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2195.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question about the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2198.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The last time when the students went to the Ethics Bowl, we were able, if I recall, to get a contributor to cover the costs of the student's trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2208.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so at this point, I would like to ask the mayor on behalf of the school committee if you could see if we could get a donor to cover the cost, as you've been successful in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5291.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5294.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to see, and maybe I've missed it, but I see the mention of an improved cafeteria, but what about the library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5361.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But under number seven, the cafeteria is part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5384.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'm reflecting back a couple of years when we submitted but unfortunately were not chosen for renovation of the whole library area and that that's not a piece of either this or the funds we spoke about earlier this evening in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5402.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that there were other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5404.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Other parts, I don't recall them off of hand, but they were very detailed at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5409.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I was surprised not to see it as a piece of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5413.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd sort of like to look back at some of the plans at that time to see where we are, because not to even be considering it at this point would seem unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5426.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in terms of what is acceptable, then I would make a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5734.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5775.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paulette?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5775.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5778.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just the one thing to keep in mind, the question is at some point we may not be able to accommodate every member's particular, as much as we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5790.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5790.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson is available on Mondays and Thursdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5794.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so that, that's the first limitation that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5797.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, the, to me, it's important, it, um, that as many members as can possibly make whatever subcommittee, uh, meeting, make them because, you know, we want our full representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5810.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, the advantage of putting it in the subcommittee is that, uh, we won't need a quorum if we can't get it, um, you know, or it's a smaller quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5819.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But for me, personally, I believe that it's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5822.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: important for every committee member who can possibly make these committee to please do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5829.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5979.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5981.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, in and of itself, apart from the fact that I happen to be the head of the committee, I personally need, you need to understand, I'm also happening to have a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5994.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only question becomes the scheduling, and the scheduling is tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5999.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What if you say you can't do Thursdays or, you know, majority of the committee, I mean, are we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6004.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we handle the scheduling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6006.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Already with these dates, people have said, I can't do that one, I can't do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6011.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that becomes the difficult part, is just a pure nuts and bolts, how do we schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6016.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a lot of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6603.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll yield to my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6664.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6665.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6665.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6666.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first question I have is the first proposed date is March 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6696.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so for me, I've got to be pragmatic at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6699.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that there's been thinking that it might be easier if it were a smaller group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6709.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the same time, I listen to my colleagues, and I know that if I wasn't on the subcommittee, I'd be arguing the way that they were, and that's a problem for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6720.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, part of me sort of says, hey, wait a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6722.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got the first meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6724.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very nicely organized here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6726.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first meeting is proposed for March 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6730.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear other concerns about that particular date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6735.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we see how it goes as a committee of the whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6738.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's try the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6739.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If it seems unwieldy after that date, we'll reconsider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6742.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I can't, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6746.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to support you, but at the same time, I sort of feel like if I was not on the committee, I would be arguing just the way my colleagues who are opposed to it are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6840.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I didn't, if I may Mayor Burke, I didn't understand why the first meeting March 14th, which is a week from tomorrow, was you said maybe it won't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6852.514s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why wouldn't it work date-wise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6868.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I made a motion that we had a committee of the whole meeting next week to, on March 14th, to discuss the items listed, guidance, English language cards, social studies, that can't happen at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6884.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where you're uncertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=100.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=100.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=101.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to suspend the rules in order to take up item number 7 under community participation, the Jingle Bell Road Race funds distribution, as well as items number 2, 3, 4, and 5 under the report of the superintendent Roman numeral 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=510.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=788.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=883.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Judy, you are such an inspiration to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=886.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you and all of your team, Rosemary, all the team, thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=892.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My colleague said it perfectly, so I'll just add my thanks from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1148.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that the members received your stories and we had a great time reading them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1154.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Especially things that made me feel a little creepy was things like green-fleshed army and you have been dead for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1163.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a great job kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1331.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nice job, Arden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1332.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I love watching you play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1672.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we're under suspension, I wish to bring information to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1678.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was approached by Kirsten Patterson to discuss the potential of doing in-depth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1686.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: budget review this year in a slightly different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1689.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've normally had quick proposals that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1693.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: presentations that have come at the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1696.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She suggested that we might do better to send it to a subcommittee to go for a very thorough, transparent look at the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1706.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to ask Christine if she could come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1709.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She suggested that it would come to the, that we would set up the meetings through the personnel subcommittee since 80% or so of the budget is personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1720.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm the head of personnel, so I just want to make it clear that for me it would be always important that every member realizes that this would be a meeting that they are welcome and encouraged to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1732.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We debated back and forth what we do with the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1735.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That puts an obligation on the whole committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1737.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1738.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There will be expected to be quite a number of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1742.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what's really important is that we always have a certain number of members present to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1749.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Christine, could you speak to the proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1751.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2730.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2730.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2732.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as the superintendent mentioned, I was talking to her and asked if I could attend when she mentioned this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2737.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really felt that it was a wonderful opportunity to understand because I didn't, quite honestly, I really didn't understand what the superintendent was getting at when she was saying learning walks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2750.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, you spent 15 minutes in each class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2752.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking, what are you going to find out in 15 minutes and whatever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2755.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was really terrific to be able to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2757.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I watched this video, I'm sure that I saw things because I was able to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2765.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, watching a student and understanding that concept of productive struggle was really great to see happening in our classroom, to understand why we want to encourage our teachers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2780.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to continue to have that grow in our classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2784.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, if you have the opportunity in the next go-around, I highly would encourage my committee members to go and I'm quite thankful I was at the right place at the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4441.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot, you're all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4444.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, Superintendent, I really appreciate your fair and equitable approach to this dilemma that we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4455.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I do believe that it certainly is going to still cause some consternation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4460.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One specific question, just to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4464.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, the McGlynn Elementary students really had a, if they wanted to stay at the McGlynn, they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4472.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now it appears that this group of students, half of them would be going to the Andrew School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4479.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4562.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, one of the questions we've had in the past had to do with the sibling preference, and I just want to be very clear as we roll this out that the sibling preference of people, and there was a past policy and discussion that happened, and it was around the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4581.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Parents argued that they had been guaranteed sibling preference for the year after their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4587.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a child perhaps was going up to the high school and going into 9th grade, but another child was coming in at the 6th grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4596.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the reason behind it was that they had spent all that time contributing and building the school, and the parents had relationships which they wanted to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4608.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: because of their support of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4610.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear that as we roll this out, that's one of the things that has arisen in the past that we need to be clear on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4673.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I absolutely understand where you're going, but I just wanted to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4681.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4686.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, there was a letter and the parents were able to substantiate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4691.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, policy can change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4692.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We just need to be very clear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4695.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing I guess is I'm curious about how you're going to roll this out now after our, I would assume we'll vote on it, but after our approval, how will you sell this to the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4772.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, I mean, I believe that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4775.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the other concern that will arise will be the friendship groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4782.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My child's over here at this school and all the friends are going over to the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4787.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to that means, I think that it's really, really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4791.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we do a very concerted effort of understanding, especially now that it's very clear that we're going to have these new mixed groups of students, that we foster activities and create opportunities for kids to get to know new children, and we make that very much part of our goal as we enter this new phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5674.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So earlier tonight, we in subcommittee talked about sort of the guiding principles of the Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5683.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what really we said was that we were here for all students and to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5689.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that their educational opportunities were the best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5693.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I go back to that guiding principle and I look at what the superintendent just presented to us, I see that there may be some short-term pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5703.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The long-term gain of making an equitable middle school environment is where we need to go for the benefit of all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5714.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate that my colleague<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5717.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero might like some more time to digest it and to talk a little bit about rollout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5725.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, I am pulled because I would also like to affirm the policy and say that we should move forward and then have a subcommittee meeting to talk about what kind of presentations we're going to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5740.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to, and I'm just trying to figure out the right rules of order to do this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5748.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: His would come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5750.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I change yours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6482.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6482.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6485.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To my colleague, Mr. Rousseau, I think that there's some pragmatic questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6489.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We started this year with a new superintendent, and she certainly needed some time to get on board and to learn the ropes and learn all the people and start with an instructional initiative with the math, which we saw earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6508.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If there was clearly a simple answer other than this in terms of the size or whatever, I think she would have presented it tonight or suggested it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6520.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The in-depth that you speak of I think is probably worthwhile doing for the whole committee and community to really understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6529.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think that there's a question that is before us in the immediate, and that is next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6537.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't think it's realistic to have had the superintendent come back and try and figure out all of those in-depth questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6544.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we need to set that as a goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6549.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6549.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6607.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6607.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out the timeline, the pragmatic point of all of this, is trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6615.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And maybe we certainly want to, as we're doing this, we certainly want to be looking at that questions in terms of either our special education or our EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6625.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way to better incorporate them into the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6630.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and equal opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6634.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the question before us right at the moment is, I hear that there is a general feeling amongst members that this is the right thing to do, that the superintendent has come to us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6649.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and she's shown us numbers, numbers speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6653.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked about equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6655.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked about doing the right thing for all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6657.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hear that we actually have some level of consensus in terms of what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6664.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I don't hear consensus on yet is whether we're going to approve the policy tonight and then have a subcommittee, or as the motion states, first have a subcommittee meeting and then approve the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6679.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6862.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So next week is vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6902.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to approve the policy change and follow it up with the committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6933.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'd like that to be a separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6975.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8354.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8354.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8356.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So included in our packet was the determination of need for an individual emergency response plan and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8365.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this ready now for a motion for adoption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8368.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you putting it forward to us now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8393.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8393.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say, I was so impressed when I read through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8396.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I had a Gen Ed kid who was absolutely incredibly scared of fire drills, and this would have been very appropriate for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8404.53s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But especially on the back page, listing all the medical needs, the tools, the accommodations, physical needs, tools, accommodations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8413.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: communication memory, social-emotional needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8416.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just thought this was an excellent, excellent document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8418.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I look forward for it to come back for approval for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8422.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=577.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=577.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=578.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=579.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would it make sense, since we have the rest of the policy here, to go ahead with the approval so everything else is updated and... I'd rather this... This is such an important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=591.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have respect for... We have a meeting next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=644.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Erin, I understand your concern and the importance of what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=648.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have some questions about how it should be worded correctly, because there's also an obligation by the physician as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=656.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So to just put all the onus on how we write it has to include both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=663.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm reluctant to all of a sudden just put a sentence in here and say we're going to approve it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=669.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hearing your concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=671.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand there was an issue that I know nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=674.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but I'm asking that we would give us an opportunity, you know, we could perhaps do it at the beginning of our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=683.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could also have a subcommittee meeting, so we could bring it back next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=686.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wouldn't it be a long time frame?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=689.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would that be acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=708.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second it with the added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=710.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We do not have anything before our meeting next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=713.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=714.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have to figure out when we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=728.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, we'll do it as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=730.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=770.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, yes, I'd like to suspend the rules and I would like to change the order of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=774.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to have the superintendent's updates and comments follow item four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=779.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1994.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just thank you to all of the students who came out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1997.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's so nice to hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1999.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would like if we could send to Judge Klein a thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2005.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: note from the school committee thanking her for taking the time out of her schedule and coming back home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2011.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2012.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure she would appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2015.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2125.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, if you could have the, maybe we could do a picture afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3637.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I spoke with Marie Cassidy, and in fact, in the auditorium, the magician is going to need to set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3644.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we need a different location for that at the McGlynn, perhaps in the library, someplace where we can put a poster up and let people know we're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3654.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, I think it would be advantageous if we had name tags for the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4559.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I seconded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4560.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, you didn't have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4562.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only other thing I would say is please keep us abreast of when there are fundraisings for this so that we can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4571.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5804.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5805.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the list from the Attorney General, there's Medford Field of Dreams is listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5812.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had an interesting relationship with the Field of Dreams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5816.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That one is not, does not show up on our list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5838.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure whether they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5841.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: collecting any money right now or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5843.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's okay, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5847.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5888.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question I had I think really reflects, I had expected a much longer list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5893.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's really the friends of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5897.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: all of those ones that you were alluding to earlier that would make sense for us to have a list of two, understanding that those are not 501c3s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5973.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was just my other question was, is there a Curtis-Tufts PTO?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5977.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is not that I was able to find at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1471.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1472.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we have our budget book, we have a name, we have a department, and we have an amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1479.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How come it works then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2978.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2978.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2980.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to remind the committee that we had voted to do a meet and greet prior to the Medford Family Network Valentine's Family Festival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2992.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was advertised, or the Valentine's Festival has been advertised between 11 and 1 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2998.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2999.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which means that our meet and greet, when we were talking about it, would be the hour before 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3004.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we must ask Superintendent that we have Lisa Evangelista, please, if she would write an article, and we have other advertising going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3015.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The idea was that the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3018.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: school committee would be available to meet and greet, and in no way would whatever room we're set up with, would that interfere with any of the setup for the Valentine Festival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3027.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we need to make sure that it's advertised, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3031.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to remind the membership that we said we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3269.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to express a little level of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3272.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While I'm interested in those numbers, I'm more interested in the confidentiality of the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3277.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wouldn't want any reporting out to put pressure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3283.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so just that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3293.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Utilizing the pantry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3294.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep in mind, for instance, there was a photo of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3298.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the event that you referenced about the, that not every one of those students necessarily was homeless or whatever, and that it's open to students and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3308.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted, you know, I'm just concerned that because we're interested in the numbers and in due diligence and all the rest, we don't then discourage kids who really need to go from going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3709.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3711.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3711.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the kindergarten registration parent, the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3717.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next to the last paragraph, it should be Medford Public Schools offers a before and after school program for registered students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3725.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Registration for both programs will begin on Monday, April 1st, 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3730.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Registration forms and pricing information will be available on the Medford Public Schools website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3736.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Somewhere you need to indicate that it is not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3742.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or that there is a cost involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3744.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So... Great suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3745.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3746.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3746.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, I haven't figured out how to put it in, but it's not guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3752.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not... We've had years where a wait list has needed to be developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3759.044s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think it's important that parents available on a first come, first serve basis or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3765.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would take a look at that, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3868.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where it says up on the top?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6398.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6398.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6399.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To follow up on that, I would like to ask to reach out back to the Attorney General's office and ask them to, in fact, record it so that somebody who's interested but who cannot go at 10.30, I mean, who cannot be in front of a computer screen at 10.30 on January 22nd<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6419.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: could watch it that evening or watch it sometime other to the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6422.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would really ask if you would go back and at least give them that suggestion and plea because it just seems that, you know, it's just not real to sort of say, oh, everybody, you've got to be available at this time, you know, to do this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6451.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone who's watching other people engage actively could learn a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6455.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe we could put a quick letter together from the Medford School Committee asking that they would please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6463.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tape it and have it available at other times for people who can't make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6970.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Would you like to sign all of them moving forward Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2118.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2120.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you let us know what the projected salary range is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2125.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2126.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can send you a copy of the job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2127.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll put it in about 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2129.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2130.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And where would the person be housed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2292.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any open interviews that school committee members could attend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4664.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Schuster, I just wanted to thank you for coming forward and sharing your knowledge with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4670.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that for me what really touched home was the increase in the potency in THC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4677.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8257.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8258.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8259.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8259.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, whenever I hear that there's a program at the McGlynn, which of course sounds like a great idea, being partnered,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8266.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to ask whether it's going to be similarly at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8275.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8276.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the second part, though, is if it's a McGlynn dance only?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8279.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8281.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So depending on how that goes, if we're not getting Andrews parents, we should see if we could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8288.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is just thinking back, and I believe it was at one of the April 2017 programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8295.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That incredibly great movie that was shown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8302.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, that was the screenagers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8303.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8304.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8305.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8306.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8309.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9130.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9131.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9131.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, or comments on the transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9136.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm assuming that this move to two smaller vans is good for the students as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9141.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just appreciated that we were taking that step to provide transportation for the newcomers in this new way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9150.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought that was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9152.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Secondarily, sort of to my concern also was, as my colleague, at this time then, there is no limitation on expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9162.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9163.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9164.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9165.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we, again, we had the same issue when we heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9168.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that certain people were told they couldn't spend it because they hadn't done it soon enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9173.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's sort of surprising in some ways that people are a little, especially since that's happened in the past, that they're not a little more proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9191.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd be happy to go help them spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9206.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, because we always know that there's other things that pop up throughout the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9210.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The last thing I just want to ask is you said that the business office team has been in transition and key roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9216.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was wondering if you could provide for the school committee a list of the names of all the business office personnel and their job titles or responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9226.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9226.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9228.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9228.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2189.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much Mr. Zigney and to the members of the string ensemble here with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2195.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This morning I woke up and I was thinking about my day and I'm thinking okay gotta do this gotta do this and I'm thinking oh yeah school committee meeting tonight and then I thought oh and we're gonna hear music tonight and they're going to be with us and it just made my day so much better knowing you were gonna be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2211.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3092.964s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3093.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3095.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need you to check into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3097.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received an email just before the meeting tonight asking us why we were not providing both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3104.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seemed to be well thought out and certainly convincing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3109.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the machine doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3112.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: support, there's always a little basket or something that we might be able to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3120.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would get back to us on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3122.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, as you said, Paul, we're making progress, and I'm glad that we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3127.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly think the initial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3131.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think the disbursement of in the locations that you described should say, let's see how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3137.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But our objective should be to provide the supplies throughout the entire schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3151.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we'll start here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3152.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think in a short time we need to evaluate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3154.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I think that's our objective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3158.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My objective, now that it's been raised to us, it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3161.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, if you would get back to us on that question, and we'll... Point of information, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3642.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before I call the roll, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, before you call the roll, there's just one other sentence that I wish the committee to look at, because I kept on reading it and kept on reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3654.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4031.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't have that in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4033.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Michael, I didn't realize that you didn't have the written minutes for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4040.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4041.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you are reporting on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4044.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing is that there is one item that, because of a time constraint, needs to be reported out from the subcommittee right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4051.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in some ways, the other stuff you're providing for us on this topic, we don't have a report on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4061.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The piece that we need to report out because of a time constraint, if I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4066.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if I can proceed, or do you want to go with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4069.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I, oh, we can go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4072.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4073.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so there's the piece that we need to proceed on is that the subcommittee suggested, Michael's been talking about other ways to make us accessible to the community, and the subcommittee had a long discussion about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4088.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one suggestion was providing, rather than a formal meeting, an opportunity for the community to have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4096.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: meet-and-greet for school committee members for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4102.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to that end, we were thinking about what events already brought the community out, and there's one coming up in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4113.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which is the Medford Family Network Valentine's Social.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4118.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we discussed the possibility of having a meet-and-greet hour before the Valentine's Social, so that at the Valentine's Social, we customarily go and we scoop ice cream, and it's really nice to see people, but it's not an opportunity to get into much conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4138.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did speak to Marie Cassidy about this, and she understood, and she said that if we were to proceed on this, she could put a line in her flyer to say prior, you know, from 2 to 3, come meet the school committee, or whatever, from 11 to 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4159.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But because she's getting that information out to the public, we should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4165.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the piece that's critical for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4224.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't remember what date it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4226.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's the second Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4260.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: confused because he thought he was bringing the report to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4262.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to explain that when you talked to me about it, I thought that the report that was on my desk was the report of this past meeting that we had on December 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5905.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention within all of the things that you mentioned, there also was an incredibly great middle school concert last Thursday night, which I had the pleasure and opportunity to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5919.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as you know, our middle school select ensemble has been gold medal winners many times over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5928.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of the levels, the 6th grade, the 7th and 8th, and the ensemble really did a terrific job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5934.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5934.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Chang is just an amazing teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5937.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to mention that tonight too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5940.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6872.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just one question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6873.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the concerns that was brought to us is the heating in the gym, and I've always been concerned about the windows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6881.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we included those in our submission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6884.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1760.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1762.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to ask if on the key actions for district improvement, number three, rather than saying by June, if you could say by mid-May, proposed key strategies, because I think it's essential that we have some time to hear the strategies and understand what the budget impact might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2035.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a wordsmithing suggestion, and I redid it a couple times, so it got shorter and shorter, but for developing a district-wide focus on instruction, if I could suggest, you might phrase it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2052.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By working with principals and other district leaders, we will develop a common language about instruction which will be used as the foundation for improving instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2064.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that a word or two was left out inadvertently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2317.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just a quick update, as you know, the MASC hosted the annual joint school committee superintendent conference from November 7th to 10th in Hyannis, Massachusetts, representing Medford were myself, member Paul Rousseau, and our associate superintendent Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2337.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Throughout the conference, we attended numerous presentations and events, including the update from the Department of Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2343.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a presentation involving all stakeholders, school law and legal updates, a presentation on the new super induction program, and many others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2354.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I myself was particularly pleased to have the opportunity to hear the new Commissioner of Education, Jeff Riley, speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2360.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He felt like a breath of fresh air and it sounded to me like he would be more concerned with the whole child<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2365.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and will take a more measured approach to standardized testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2368.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was the first opportunity that I had to hear the Commissioner, and I'm hoping that we might set up to invite him to Medford to see some of our wonderful programs, completely like I thought about the CCSR or some of our early child programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2387.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to get the Commissioner here, and it was really wonderful to hear him<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2394.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He truly was a breath of fresh air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2397.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Another highlight of the conference was the Thursday morning keynote speaker, Mark Brackett, PhD, a founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2408.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Brackett explained his RULER approach, an acronym for the five key emotion skills of recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, and regulating emotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2418.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I referred to him at our last meeting when we were talking about social-emotional learning issues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2424.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He is going to have some work that we might want to participate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2431.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He was very, very inspirational, and so truly a highlight of the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2437.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I myself facilitated the Division II meeting, which is our geographic region for MASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2446.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We re-elected Stacey Rizzo from Revere to lead the division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2449.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's a wonderful, active school committee member in Revere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2454.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And finally, I think that the MASC conference is always a way to connect with fellow school committee members from across the Commonwealth and gain an understanding that what we are dealing with here in Medford and issues that are important to us are also important to our fellow school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2470.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It provides an opportunity to get a much broader view than just simply, you know, in our local community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2913.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a very exciting opportunity for the band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2916.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Haley, it's just been so thrilling to watch the band get better and better with every performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2922.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The pep rally was just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2924.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The performances were just terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2928.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really need to congratulate you and every member because those kids, they're working hard and they're having a great deal of fun and you can see it on their faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2937.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5412.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5414.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is what we developed consistent with, does it make sense to have that happen before we see what the state has in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5422.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5468.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there's no reason not to go ahead, as my colleague suggests, with the form that we developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5568.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1551.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1551.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1552.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that that was Judy Lonergan's baby and that she was the one who started it and I think that whenever we talk about we should mention because it was a great idea and she really put a lot of work into it and she got it off the ground and we're really, our schools have really benefited from the fundraising that the run accomplishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2442.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wondered, as you spoke about the zones of regulation, I know that the Medford Educational Foundation had received requests from different guidance Councilors or whatever for signage, for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2457.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2458.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we been able to provide our students with, or each of our schools with some materials to support the zones of regulation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2474.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think that the thing was, our concern was that, well, at the time, it seemed very piecemeal, and we wanted it to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2485.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: unified so that every school had the same sort of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2488.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To be honest with you, I see that as a school initiative since we're doing this, that these are things that we should provide our classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2495.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd really like to have an opportunity to sit down and see what we've got and what in each school and what really the Councilors and teachers, the principals feel is necessary in terms of some visual reminders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2531.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2532.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The foundation didn't want to fund piecemeal projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2536.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not what we're about, so we've really been waiting for this year to see what the initiative is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2544.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And perhaps we'll be able to support it to some degree, but only if we have an understanding that we have a comprehensive approach to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2556.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, I just want to mention that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2559.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau and I, Paul, we had a wonderful opportunity at the school committee conference to hear a professor from Yale speak on social emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2569.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have his name with me today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2570.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know he's going to be doing an in-service sort of training, which was really geared for superintendents, but unfortunately it's the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2580.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: days as your superintendent conference down on the Cape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2583.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think we should look into it and see if it's a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2587.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He was truly inspiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2589.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it might be nice to be able to send someone from our district to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2593.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2596.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5198.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did get to attend the evening, and I did find it very difficult to get around to all the different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5204.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I joined a tour group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5206.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will say the kids were great, and I heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5209.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and read in here, in your report, which is terrific, even though you didn't get that many responses, the responses you did get were very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5218.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And many of them mentioned how terrific the tour guides were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5222.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I was a little bit concerned because it did seem that it was hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5226.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I went back and, you know, went back to the CCSR and then it was all the way back around and it was like, whoa, this isn't, you know, and I started to see people sort of leave their tour group, which was problematical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5240.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is, and it's just because you're before me, I'm going to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5244.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In here, a couple people mentioned it was very hot and I think they were referring particularly to the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5251.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After that evening, I asked John McLaughlin,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5254.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: about the heat issue, and he did tell me that someone was coming in on November 6th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5260.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it better now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5263.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5264.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I haven't followed it up in any other way, you know what I'm saying, and so I just was curious how it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5274.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5317.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5317.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, my comments aren't meant to be a criticism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5320.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5321.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5321.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just a question of the fact is that you've got a lot of things to showcase and, you know, it's a relatively short two hours of showcasing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5331.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm glad, you know, that it went as well as it did and that, you know, as you, I think it's a continual refinement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5339.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6814.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6814.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Michael, I've been thinking about this a lot in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6819.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things, as soon as you just said ice cream, one of the things that I was thinking about is, and I think there are some things that you haven't really been able to participate in yet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6829.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, for example, having a formal meeting and having all of this sort of information fair and volunteer fair and child care and entertainment seems at odds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6843.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They don't seem to fit together for me in terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6847.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6849.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what the value is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6849.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is always value, always valuable being accessible to constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6855.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So part of the thing that many of us have done is, for example, in February, the MFN hosts the Ice Cream Social.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6862.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a Saturday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6864.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was trying to say to myself, OK, so one piece, for example, is most often, certainly many of us are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6872.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe what we should do is start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6876.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 45 minutes early or something and have an opportunity, meet the school committee members before we go and serve ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6884.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we always go serve ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6886.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Frankly, it's a great time to meet and interact with community members and their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6893.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6895.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe there's a way to formalize a little piece of that so that there's a session beforehand or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6902.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, we have our job to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6904.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, you have to be careful because you don't want to compete with the magician, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6910.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6911.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Another thing that we used to have was an evening with the superintendent, which the school committee members tended to show up at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6919.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for a while, there was a period of time when we actually got a pretty good response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6927.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was an opportunity then for the superintendent, and I might say, if we might say, an evening with the superintendent and school committee members for the community to come to hear the initiatives of the superintendent and school committee so that it was sort of understanding what the vision was of the body and doing something which was targeted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6954.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the question that, and we've discussed volunteer work in the community engagement subcommittee has talked about volunteer work, to me that almost feels separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6966.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or we have a health fair that happens on Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6970.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the health fair would be, if you were to think about health care and volunteering, we already have an event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6977.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's well attended, that we could combine a piece where the school committee members are present at that and we might set up other school activities to bring in that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6989.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As your resolution stands, I can't support it because I think that it's not focused enough to be valuable because it's going to be an awful lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7005.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to create that event and wondering whether it will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7010.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But to take your idea and say, which I think certainly has value, and to take a look at different pieces of it and say, how do we accomplish what you want to accomplish in existing venues which we could expand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7028.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: without creating so much work, I think has value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7032.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, rather than vote on it, I think the interesting thing is I think it should go back to the Community Engagement Subcommittee and that that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7047.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the place to kind of sort out and to identify ways that we could work on this objective without going to one Saturday event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7059.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, the other piece of it, which I've mentioned to you just a little bit, I do think that one other thing that we might look at, maybe it comes at the same time when we do a superintendent thing, is helping inform the committee a little bit more about our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7073.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, just another piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7075.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm making a motion to send it to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7085.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1775.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1775.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1776.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mayor Burke, I commend you for already reaching out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1779.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if that does come through, that's great, but I'll second my colleague's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1783.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not been unusual for us at all when we have outstanding students to support them and to let them be able to represent us with great pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1794.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we want to make sure you get to go no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2678.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not really a question, but I just wanted to say to the students and to yourself, it was so great to see you at the Cummings event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2686.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it was, I thought the students who asked questions did a particularly good job and it was really nice, especially since Mr. Cummings has been so grateful and generous to the CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2697.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was so grateful to see the students in attendance and to express their gratitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2702.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much for going and for being there and for all the work you're doing both to Rich, Michael, and to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2711.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3222.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You bet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3224.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3224.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3225.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not sure whether I can make it on Monday, but I, uh, on Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, but I know that I can start off the donations, so here you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=596.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's disappointing that the tiles are not being produced anymore in the sense that a tile gives you an easily replaceable piece, while the pour is a much bigger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=612.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we know what the life expectancy of the pour is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=693.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, two things that I have to take from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=695.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first is, it's terrific that the grant is still going to cover this, even though it's not a tile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=702.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that I'm greatly relieved to hear that news tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=706.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the second is, as difficult as it was that this project did not move forward quicker, in retrospect, now we can look back and say, thank God it didn't move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=716.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: quicker because we would then have an inappropriate tile that was defective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=723.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So God works in strange and unusual ways, and this may be one of them, but I am so very glad to hear that we can move ahead now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=730.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we need to take a vote in order to accomplish that of any sort?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=742.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to vote again here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=743.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we need to vote again on the school committee floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=850.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it need to be poured while under a certain temperature?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1238.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1276.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1277.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're planning on selling a lot of tickets, but the small cost of the tickets may work in your favor, because everybody can afford a ticket, so great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1288.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do want to tell you that you guys are reinventing the Home and School Association, the Medford Home and School Association,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1295.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which has a deep history way back when, because I know it's something that I was involved in way back when, and the idea of it was exactly what you were doing, but at that time we had 13 schools all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1308.992s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, we had a logo, and the logo was an umbrella because we were bringing everybody together under one umbrella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1314.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only did we do the sort of fundraising that you're doing, which was to say a citywide component, but we also, and this is just in the future, when you want something to do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1325.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We ran events, like we brought in the Bennington Puppets, something that, that one's just, we brought in the Boston Ballet, something that one school and group of fundraisers could not do, could not have the energy, but together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1342.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: people working together could do really fantastic things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1344.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So congratulations, and I'm so glad to see this effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1347.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you want any more information about the original, I can certainly tell you, but it is... I don't know what name you want to give us, Medford Elementary Citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1356.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't say just elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1358.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was the Medford Home and School Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1360.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So throw it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1362.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1574.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1574.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1575.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1575.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A lot of exciting things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1577.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1579.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I'm so excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2564.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mrs. Lopore, for being before us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2567.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I looked through this in detail and I thought it sounded wonderfully interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2570.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I was going, well, I almost wish I was going until I saw you arriving at 3.45 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2575.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then on the day that you're leaving, you're departing at 4 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2580.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, it is not for the faint-hearted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2583.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2585.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly will have my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3614.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to mention that last year, I think it was myself and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3617.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kreatz, Kathy, were able to attend one of the wonderful events at the Roberts School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3624.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was really fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3625.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was joyous to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3626.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the kids were having fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3628.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And clearly, it was a very positive start to their day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3632.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3633.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank you for the presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3636.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I sort of have a feeling that we might be able to reach out to our new principal at the McGlynn and perhaps working together, we can get them involved as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3671.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I think this is Judy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3673.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4144.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, could you speak a little louder into the microphone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4147.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4393.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have one question because I think maybe one of you might know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4397.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On Playstead Road, all of a sudden there was a stencil of a bicycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4401.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's not a bicycle lane, it's going down the middle of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4405.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I've had people ask me if I understand why, rather than Everett Bicycle Lane, we have the stencil in the middle of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4412.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So do you know the answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4495.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4592.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4703.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4703.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4704.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually found it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4705.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's on the fourth page of the summary of the next generation district in school, this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4713.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it says, in an effort to control for student trends, DESE intends to measure the performance of each district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4720.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the last line is, however, results for the lowest performing students group will include only those students who have been enrolled in the same school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4729.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for two consecutive years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4731.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is an improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4733.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, for the lowest performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4736.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was something that I know that was very concerning to districts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4744.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in the urban group whose students moved frequently between, say, Somerville, Chelsea, Medford, Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4753.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there was a group of school committee members spearheaded by Mary Jo Rossetti of Somerville, who's now a city council person, who had worked so diligently on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=4763.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is probably their attempt to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5702.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5705.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could we ask, first, for how much that would cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5710.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, then, is it retroactive for the people who just paid already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5714.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So before I vote on that, I would just be more comfortable if we were to bring it back next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5804.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Megan, could you just give us a review of at least ballpark, because I know it differs a little bit, but what is the tuition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6673.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Dr. Baer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6675.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had the opportunity to meet a couple times already, so it's delightful to have you here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6681.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question, which seems appropriate to ask you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6684.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As part of the school committee's responsibilities at some point, it's our responsibility to assess our superintendent on a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6693.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But here we have a new superintendent who's only getting her feet wet and doing a tremendous job so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6700.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of those things, if I remember from the past, of course, is that the superintendent develops goals, measurable goals with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6709.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At which point with a new superintendent should we begin to think about that process so that we are doing our due diligence in terms of giving her feedback that is responsible and coordinated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6723.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's perfect timing for that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8183.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand my colleagues, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8185.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mustone's urgency about this, and I'm just curious whether there's a different way to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8191.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we, and you know, I certainly understand the budgeting for this year and next year and whatever, but is there any way that we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8200.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: accelerate our adoption by bringing in in the springtime some more teachers and we could classroom units because you know if I had a student in the fourth grade in the school who was in a classroom who wasn't getting it knowing that my friend student friends child was I'd be really upset and so that well I understand you know piloting and whatever there's there seems like an inequity in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8225.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to balance those two needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8228.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think it's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8230.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And sometimes we've worked, if you would, publishers or companies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8236.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to even though we might take something earlier, the payment might still be thrown into the next year, especially because they understand our budgeting too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8246.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if there was a way that we could accelerate the adoption in the spring and perhaps bring in more teachers by starting with the spring units, I think that's what would be ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8256.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8340.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I clearly was thinking about it, Superintendent, in terms of having a discussion of seeing if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8347.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we've done it before, I mean, over years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8350.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We took sort of early receivership of materials and then it was thrown into the next year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8356.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, it all depends on the company's willingness to take, you know, to work that out with us or not, but just throw it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8664.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8664.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This, of course, better indicates the difference between the McGlynn and the Andrews, which is 24 students apart, still close enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8676.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I did want to report that this weekend I ran into a parent and student, and student as well, who was currently attending sixth grade at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8690.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the parent related to me that they had not been successful in their lottery choice and that she had been put at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8701.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the parent told me she had been very upset at the time and now they couldn't be happier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8707.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so it was such a heartening story to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8712.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and the student was just beaming and repeatedly told me how much she likes being at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8730.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She mentioned that multiple times, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8982.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9188.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9188.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9190.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have a letter sent out on behalf of the school committee with our deepest thanks for this gift agreement and I mean it's just fantastic so if you would express our thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9219.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9272.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, I just also want to add that while I never was a school committee member contemporary of his,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9279.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had the privilege and honor of serving with him on the building the future committee and George was a very active and fun and you know we had during that period of time we had more meetings than you can count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9292.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we sat and we deliberated on so many different things from both large to the small, to the minute, to the color of the tiles and the paint and et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9303.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, George was so much fun and such an active member of that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9307.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will long remember him and feel very grateful to have known him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=381.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=383.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=383.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=384.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would assume then also we'll get together and figure out some sort of reception that we might have to dedicate the plaque and the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=857.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since we haven't approved many liquor licenses, I just want to understand exactly what the process is, if you could clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=885.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=885.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=899.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1308.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I understand that the steps that need to happen are one, this document needs to be transferred to the Medford Public Schools and listed on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1316.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then some outreach needs to be done so each of the PTOs and organizations are contacted and informed that they need to send this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1326.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's a major piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1329.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not sure that's all going to happen by the date that we originally had set out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1334.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, probably not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1335.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Probably not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1760.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we're under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1764.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received in our packets an update on the pressers, which I had requested last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1771.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet, it was not on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1772.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was nothing referenced on our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1775.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to mention, since we're not going to update the General Welcome, that one of the things that we've seen is that many of our pressers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1791.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with compressors, and as my colleague noted, they're 15,000 a cup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1795.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is a very important, you know, when we had those hot days, and all of a sudden we were relying on the air conditioning, this is a very important piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1807.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And obviously, before we put off being able to replace these compressors when they should have been, I'm making the point of it because I think that, you know, as we speak about a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1819.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: capital plan, this is clearly a unit, a place that we need to consider now, putting money aside, so that when we have these hot days, as we did at the historic school, we will be able to turn on the air conditioning effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1834.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to reference that since it was proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1837.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2322.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2323.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2329.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Christine, for continuing your work on this and for the people at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2333.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Cheryl, for being tenacious and bringing the information last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2340.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't wait for the dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2360.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2922.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, well, you've had a chance now to get your feet wet a little bit, and I'm just wondering what your plan is in terms of an administrative assistant, or whether you're still thinking of what the central office should look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2957.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4597.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just for clarity, we are not moving the report on Lesley University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4601.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are reporting the issue of our, just to be clear, of our language achievement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4608.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=594.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor for executive session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=600.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=600.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seconded by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=609.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Heston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=718.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just a wonderful thing for us to be starting out this school year with the teacher's contract in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=728.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that for all the people who worked on it and made sure that it happened so that we could cast our votes tonight, we're very, very happy and thankful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1375.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1442.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I also got calls letting me know that you were on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1448.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And people just really felt the same way that I did, that Mr. Benedetto and my colleagues did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1454.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What a great way to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1455.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2295.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John, I just wanted to ask, obviously, we've had a very hot start to the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2302.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How was bringing all of our air conditioning on and did it work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2388.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so can you, if I could ask for a follow-up report of each of the schools and where we are in terms of the compressors, how many we need, so that we're aware of it, because obviously with the start of school like this, we need it to come online and work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3079.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You gave us two samples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3081.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One was black topped and the other one was a sandy color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3084.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which one will be used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3098.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just concerned about the black top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3107.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4320.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4325.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what I'm understanding is that Mrs. Rodriguez is saying we don't need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4329.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could use the statewide contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4331.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I haven't quite figured out the discrepancy between what she's saying and why we would reopen the bid process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4352.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4353.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would we do the product through the statewide contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4359.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any difference in what we've received?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4361.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4371.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4378.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we would, then we would have to bid the labor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4385.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4452.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mayor Burke, is it possible, since we all want to resolve this in the best possible way, is there possible that we could ask someone from the procurement office to sit down with Christine, with Mrs. Rodriguez, maybe with yourself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4465.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and talk, maybe talk to the, I just don't want to do anything illegal if we're not, you know, because we've already had a bid, so we need to be careful about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4474.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But could we, clearly we can't settle it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4478.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly we want this, we want that playground done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4481.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm extraordinarily disappointed that it wasn't accomplished this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4486.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So could I make a motion that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4490.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the procurement office, Mrs. Rodriguez, Christine Patterson, sit down with this, perhaps have a discussion with the contractor who Mrs. Rodriguez talked with to see if there is a way to move forward on this for a less expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4828.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I've made a motion that we have people sit down and talk to each other, including Mrs. Rodriguez, so that people are at the same table because questions have been raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4840.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very difficult for us right here to be able to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4843.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so since there are discussions and everybody wants the same thing, we all want the same thing on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4851.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would ask my colleagues to second and vote on my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4871.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4872.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I said anybody who's germane to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5428.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I have a motion though saying let's get... For a meeting, an immediate meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5432.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, for people around the table to get together because there still is a discrepancy and I still believe it's important for both, for every person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5440.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not casting aspersions any way of saying that someone did the wrong thing or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5445.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: RFP has to be very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5448.691s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5452.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, Cheryl has invested a great deal of time into this, and we're very grateful to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5460.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, let's get people around the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5462.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't solve it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5465.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I ask to call my motion, please, and I believe you seconded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5486.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Kirsten, who thinks to be there as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5496.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5497.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I mean, if we wanted to include a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5911.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could we ask that there be an update about the Leslie project and collaboration, either at our next school committee meeting or the one following that, depending on what's most appropriate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6535.904s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was, it had to go, and again, I really have to look back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6540.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It had to go to committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6542.009s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It couldn't just be done on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6543.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We couldn't just say, oh, yes, we're going to name it for somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6547.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, more, a little more information needed to be coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6551.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I'm sure we're all in favor of Lena being honored, but there is a process, and I think that there's a reason to keep to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6560.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need to send it to a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6563.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do forget there's some recommendation involved if we could look into it and check back to what it was just so that we're following our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6618.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, the band room is now a designation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6623.038s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll get some information to the superintendent so that she can send it out and we can set up a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6632.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6633.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6633.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, again, we can't vote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6635.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was definitely a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6636.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't just vote it at a school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6638.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6643.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe that there was, we could have it in a separate meeting before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6647.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reasoning behind it, there was a very exact reason behind it, which hasn't always been followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6653.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's true, but the reasoning behind it is that we just didn't want someone coming up and all of a sudden saying, oh yeah, we should name this four, without reflective thought, and does that make sense, and what is the larger picture, so that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7151.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7152.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7153.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Diane, I just wanted to also thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7155.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that you've had, as you've, we've been in this transition, you've had a large role and I wanted to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7163.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8089.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8089.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, so on one day we've got 141<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8095.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: sixth graders at the Andrews, and another day we have 140.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8099.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what we want to know is, without children being absent, how many, what is the number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8111.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we have the, what is the maximum number that are showing up now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8121.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the maximum number that are enrolled at that school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8131.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what we need and what Paul is saying is in order to determine what we're looking at, we really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8138.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: these numbers are the snapshot of the day as opposed to the potential large picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8144.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what I understand is you're saying I can't, I don't quite have that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8149.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What we're wondering is, you know, all of a sudden we see that the sixth grade is the same and then on the next day it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8159.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we don't know, we can't tell by this, did we lose some people who then maybe enrolled their child at a different school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8167.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: because of the issues around the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8169.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we need a follow-up report on that when we get maximum numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8932.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: last year, and I'm glad you were proactive and not a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8936.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9767.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for a while, PTOs, there was a period of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9772.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: when different school PTOs did in fact take some of that on and were buying in bulk and coordinating the supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9782.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9783.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It takes a lot of effort and time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9784.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you have a parent who's revved up about it and it lasts for a couple of years and then kind of falls by the wayside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9791.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's certainly beneficial, but it is a, you know, it's just one more thing of organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9799.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that isn't to say that it isn't worth trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10053.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to know whether we've replaced the teacher at the vocational school, the marketing teacher, whether we found someone to, I believe, that position retired or left for another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10076.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so one teacher did leave though, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10078.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10080.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=658.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'd like to suspend the rules, order of business, so that we can take up the new business, the CASA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2609.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of information, that no good deed goes unpunished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3185.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I think that it's great that Erin, you've done the work on the homeless issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3191.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Michael, you're interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3192.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's certainly one that the MASC, Massachusetts Associated School Committees, has been interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3198.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfunded mandates altogether has been a constant theme of their trying to, of advocacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3205.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's very, very frustrating that the number of unfunded mandates that school systems have to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3213.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the budget overall, I think it's a, I was very pleased to see that the bottom line had risen and that we were able to accommodate so many things that we did want to put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3230.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that, Mayor, we're putting a great deal of trust in you because the other night you did, in response to one of my questions, mention that once you understand the level of free cash the city has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3242.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we would be looking at a capital budget, which is just so essential now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3247.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've actually been putting it off a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3249.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we came in, I think maybe two and a half years ago, we actually have done, we have the list of things that needs to be done, although they need to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3258.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But some of those very same things, for example, playgrounds and whatever, they're on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3264.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's much smaller items and much bigger items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3266.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that is the one place in the budget which is just a little tough because, for instance, when I see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3271.506s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The $100,000 in telephone savings, that would have been nice to be able to keep in the budget, but I have to be realistic about the demands of money on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3280.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm putting my trust in you, Mayor Burke, to make sure that we are going to move forward on a capital budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3287.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that there's, we always have to understand, I said several times last week, that we are essentially in the bottom line, approving the bottom line of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3296.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3297.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that there always has to be understood that there will be some changes and some flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3302.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we talk about areas that are of concern, that we might be seeing changes, hopefully, in the ways that the committee would like to direct over the next couple of weeks and months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3315.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to put a motion forward to approve the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3323.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3325.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To approve the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3326.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because my daughter is employed in the vocational program, I'd like to sever the vocational salary budget for $2,416,682 and vote on that separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3336.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then put forward a, so with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3343.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: someone else could put forward that motion to approve that piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3347.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I would put forward a motion to approve the rest of the budget, 58,608,631, which will give us a grand total of 66,629,011.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3353.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor for approval of the vocational salary budget for fiscal 19 of $2,416,682?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a motion by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3358.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3399.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3693.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to mention that after our budget meeting on Thursday, by chance I found myself walking out to our cars with the new superintendent-elect, and she and I had a very interesting discussion about the kindergarten aides and what her<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3714.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what she would like to see for kindergarten age, what she would want expectations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3720.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She obviously would very much like to see support in kindergartens, but she also had some very clear ideas which were, I don't think it's for me to share, but I can guarantee you from that discussion that I've had with her, I don't think that this is just something that's going to go by the wayside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3737.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think we want her to be able to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3740.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've talked about that there is some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3742.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: levels of flexibility in the budget that we need to hear the report from the security company to determine which way we're going forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3750.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so without, I mean, again, it's a little, I don't want to speak for her, but yet I do want to share with my colleagues that I had a most interesting conversation about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3759.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I feel comfortable from that, that she has a direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3978.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, you know, I guess it's a different, different way of approach because for me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3983.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am voting for all the teachers who are in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3986.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm voting for all the administrators who are in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3988.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm voting for all of the supplies that are in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3993.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm voting for all of the coaches who are in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3995.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm voting for all of the different, every level of different things and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4001.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While I certainly understand the importance of some of the smaller other issues that people are bringing up and are concerned about, and I share that concern too, there are so many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4015.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think a vote no for the budget says that we are not providing adequate monies to educate our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4023.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe that we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4025.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we always would like to have more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4027.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody would like to have more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4029.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But this is a sound budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4164.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: appropriate to thank all of the people who worked on the budget, particularly our superintendent of finance, Christine Patterson, and everybody else who just helped put this together, who did number crunching, who did paper collating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4180.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a huge job, and we're most appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=223.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=223.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=224.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May we take community participation before the report of committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=228.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=228.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=393.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=394.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a great event last year, and I'm so glad you're here and going to continue the tradition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=399.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=400.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1028.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1029.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1034.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1046.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1056.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1061.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1065.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1077.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, projectile is probably the word that I really want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1082.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1084.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: ask if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1115.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: maybe some signage, too, about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1130.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1141.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it matter that there's a slope?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1162.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and how about watering the trees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1164.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: making sure they've got enough water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1181.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1188.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's great, girls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1189.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much for your presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1530.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1530.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1531.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one of the things which makes this particularly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1535.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is that the fact that you guys are just freshmen now and you're gonna be able to, you're gonna have a piece of this throughout the rest of your high school career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1543.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that really makes this even more meaningful than if you were seniors going out the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1548.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3248.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3249.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, obviously, there's a lot we can learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3252.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Smaller groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students, and being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3267.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3275.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we might also think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3277.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3292.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whatever, for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3295.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I'd really like to see both of those happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3300.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3307.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3308.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very end of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3309.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3309.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3314.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What would your optimum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3317.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: timing be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3349.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3349.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3350.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3354.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I realize that it is difficult to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3356.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: faculty members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3364.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4115.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I love the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4116.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of questions in terms of practicality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4120.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know the Italian exams that you take where the kids just like- The national exams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4126.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4126.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We do it in all three languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4137.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so how much does the AAPPL?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4154.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And students take it as in their, win of their senior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4169.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4180.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4181.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it doesn't really come then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4183.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really given at graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4192.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4193.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's really given at graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4196.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will, because they would like to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4210.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a relatively small cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4211.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many kids do you anticipate would take it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4214.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said you were 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4230.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so we might have 40 or 60?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4357.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate Mrs. DeCarlo for bringing us this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4360.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4979.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just too wanted to add my thoughts, and I know we're going to see you again, but it's been a long wonderful journey with you, and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much, and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4994.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5073.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, they have, they have the whole report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5075.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5075.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see, no, we didn't get to pricing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6101.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6103.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6115.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6123.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet at the same time, I think that there isn't any equity that builds into our system<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6129.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where we don't have EL students at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6134.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Given the numbers that we have now and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6138.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6244.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6497.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I, yes, I'm fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8207.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden, we've got three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8214.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One's from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8218.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8282.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8291.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd make a motion that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8293.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: go forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8323.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8667.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8670.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to ask a question in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8673.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, we've got 169 kids at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8680.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have two teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8683.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each team is made up of four classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8687.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we do the math, that means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8689.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8707.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was talking about core academic classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8710.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the two teams, if you would, it means there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8712.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there would be 85 on each team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8715.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8727.828s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, we've been very proud of our class size numbers, and frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8738.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8746.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8749.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got many elementary kids classrooms where there might be 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8754.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8759.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand how much pain this causes parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8763.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know in terms of the inequity, in terms of our teaching staff, there may be teachers at the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8771.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Andrews who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8821.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8828.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the projections over all the years, it was a clear swing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8831.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8834.529s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8858.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8859.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I was looking at her face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8861.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8950.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8951.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I do, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8954.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8967.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8986.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in terms of the split that currently is in place, are there...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8997.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10289.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So along that same line of thinking, we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10294.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10302.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They don't have any additional friends there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10305.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They've been made to go to a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10307.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10310.796s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are you getting the six from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10315.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The six who are going to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10319.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10323.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10323.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so then two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10325.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, it's two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10326.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10911.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Fingers are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10913.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10918.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And obviously, he didn't have time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10920.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we're zeroing in on one particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10924.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Setting up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school, on a day, or the end, just where parents might be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10937.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance, and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10950.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I'd go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10953.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I think you set a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10954.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10965.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you set that up this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10966.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said send a letter home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10969.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10976.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10984.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11001.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that that would be beneficial no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11004.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand Mr. Tucci's just taking on a new position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11008.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11010.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11014.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11077.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think you need a night meeting when parents can... To be honest with you, I would do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11081.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11086.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, certainly Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11087.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Galusi can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11093.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whether there would be any to talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11096.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11103.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11106.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we make it clear that it's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11110.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at least we've given it another shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11459.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof up next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11460.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11476.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we were not, the sound was not on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11480.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was actually very helpful for us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11483.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think, I mean, that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11493.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11505.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11515.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered, I just sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11599.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the emergency cover the sound off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11603.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the emergency cover that the sound is off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11624.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11630.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11633.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=223.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=223.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=224.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May we take community participation before the report of committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=228.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=228.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=393.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=394.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a great event last year, and I'm so glad you're here and going to continue the tradition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=399.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=400.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1029.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1034.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1046.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1056.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1061.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1065.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1077.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, projectile is probably the word that I really want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1082.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1084.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: ask if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit, and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1115.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: maybe some signage too about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1130.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1140.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it matter that there's a slope?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1161.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and how about watering the trees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1164.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Making sure they've got enough water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1181.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1188.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's great, girls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1189.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much for your presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1530.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1530.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1531.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one of the things which makes this particularly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1535.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is that the fact that you guys are just freshmen now, and you're gonna be able to, you're gonna have a piece of this throughout the rest of your high school career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1543.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that really makes this even more meaningful than if you were seniors going out the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1548.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3248.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3249.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So obviously there's a lot we can learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3252.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Smaller groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3259.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3267.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3275.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we might also think about, there are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3292.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whatever, for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3295.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd really like to see both of those happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3300.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3307.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3308.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very end of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3309.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3309.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3314.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What would your optimum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3317.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: timing be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3349.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3349.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3350.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3354.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I realize that it is difficult to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3356.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: faculty members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3364.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4113.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: van der Vloot, I love the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4115.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of questions in terms of practicality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4120.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know the Italian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4122.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: exams that you take where the kids, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4125.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The national exams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4137.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so how much does the AAPPL?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4154.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And students take it as in their, when of their senior year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4169.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4180.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4181.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it doesn't really come then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4183.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really given at graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4192.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4193.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's really given at graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4196.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will because they would like to get it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4210.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a relatively small cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4211.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many kids do you anticipate would take it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4214.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said you were 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4230.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so we might have 40 or 60?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4356.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate Mrs. DiCarlo for bringing us this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4360.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4978.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just too wanted to add my thoughts and I know we're going to see you again but it's been a long wonderful journey with you and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4994.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5073.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5074.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, they have, they have the whole report, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6101.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6103.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6115.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Which I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6123.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet at the same time, I think that there is an inequity that builds into our system<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6129.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where we don't have EL students at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6134.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Given the numbers that we have now and the redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the Andrews?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6244.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8206.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8206.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kleef.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8207.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden we've got three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8214.124s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One's from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8218.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8282.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8291.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd make a motion that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8293.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: go forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8323.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8667.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8670.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to ask a question in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8673.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now we've got 169 kids at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8680.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have two teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8683.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Each team is made up of four classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8687.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we do the math, that means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8689.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8707.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was talking about core academic classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8710.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the two teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8711.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you would, it means there would be 85 on each team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8715.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8727.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, we've been very proud of our class size numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8731.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8736.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So certainly for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8746.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8749.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got many elementary kids' classrooms where there might be 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8754.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8759.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand how much pain this causes parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8763.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know in terms of the inequity in terms of our teaching staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8767.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There may be teachers at the Andrews who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8821.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at the projections over all the years, there was a clear swing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8831.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8834.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8858.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I was looking at her face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8950.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8951.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8952.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8954.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8967.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8987.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in terms of the split that currently is in place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8997.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9020.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Darn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10289.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So along that same line of thinking, we have said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10302.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They don't have any additional friends there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10305.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They've been made to go to a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10307.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10315.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The six who are going to the... Two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10319.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10320.824s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Six didn't request anything and they're going... Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10324.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so then... Two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10325.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, it's two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10326.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so... I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10911.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Fingers are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10913.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10918.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And obviously, he didn't have time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10920.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we're zeroing in on one particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10924.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Setting up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school on a day or the end of where parents might be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10937.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10950.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I'd go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10953.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I think you set a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10954.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10965.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you set that up this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10966.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said send a letter home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10969.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10976.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, the fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10984.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11001.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that that would be beneficial no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11004.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand Mr. Tucci is just taking on a new position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11008.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11010.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11014.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11081.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11086.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11087.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11087.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Galusi can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is, whether there would be any to talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11096.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11103.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11106.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, and then we make it clear that it's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11110.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But at least we've given it another shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11459.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof up next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11460.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11476.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we were not, the sound was not on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11480.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was actually very helpful for us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11483.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think, I mean that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11493.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11505.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11515.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered, I sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11522.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11599.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the emergency cover the sound off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11603.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the emergency cover that the sound is off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11623.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11624.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11630.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11633.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2403.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2403.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2404.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2411.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They've asked if we could move them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4519.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4520.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4524.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4543.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: maximize the potential for every student at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4547.607s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4555.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do not make the leap that I think some have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4559.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a lot of tension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4560.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4561.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's a fact, that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact, many of the McGlynn teachers came and addressed the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4569.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are our staff, our people who are working at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4591.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I only see bright things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4593.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4599.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5788.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, I just wanted to mention one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5791.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5801.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly, as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5809.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5821.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5830.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5840.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5848.842s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: feeling of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5856.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera, and so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6718.895s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6719.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6720.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6729.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: excluding that as a potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6730.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But they have to be reviewed by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6732.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but they would be, we would be part of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6735.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6745.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6755.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there certainly needs to be movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6757.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, we might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6765.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7694.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7694.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to mention a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7697.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7718.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, she's retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7721.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The deputy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7722.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The deputy superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7723.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly Nelson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7724.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7725.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So she's retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7727.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7728.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7730.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not the time to ask her in her career as she winds down for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7739.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Another potential would have been Dr. Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7743.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I don't think it's appropriate to then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7747.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: ask the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7755.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Things change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7756.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that the superintendent is able.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7760.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7778.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7787.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7796.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7800.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that they were extenuating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7804.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In my mind,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7806.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7819.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7832.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7835.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, and you know, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7847.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7860.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I feel that we are elected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7864.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: in the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7881.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7885.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in my mind,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7887.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep an experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7956.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: van de Kloet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7957.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7965.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you meant the question now in a respectful way, and that we responded by saying, hey, this is the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7974.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7975.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7978.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7988.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to look at the large picture and determine what was the best course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7997.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8000.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8012.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Two did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision, but this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8021.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Five of us agreed that this was the best way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8025.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In going forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8026.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely, especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8031.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8036.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hopefully we won't in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8040.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8049.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9083.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just have a couple of thoughts on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9088.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If, I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Edouard-Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9103.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9117.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely key and so I would want to see us move on I Understand there might be some negotiations involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9125.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position, but I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9133.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9146.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9151.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: here there's no principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9153.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first thing we have to do is move on on that appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9157.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be my number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9159.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second is the most obvious and is that we have a group of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9163.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's 21 students at the McGlynn and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9171.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now maybe not all 21 would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9174.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But certainly if there is, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9185.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9198.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But over time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9200.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mr. Martelloni did this very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9203.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He showed us in his graphs how it had changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9207.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9213.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9215.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9224.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I definitely think that we should at least send out letters to parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9229.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to put a principle in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9231.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to have, and we need to at least target maybe the McGlynn Elementary students saying, would you be willing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9239.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, again, there may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs a change, but then maybe on the other hand, someone's going to be here who the principal is and the rest of the group, and they're going to say, hey, I'd kind of like him for my kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9250.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He would be a good match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9252.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be my first thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10529.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10530.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10542.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, clearly it does make more sense for him also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10546.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10553.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10562.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was the—I mean, when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10569.423s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: these schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10576.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10580.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll talk about that at our next meeting too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10583.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll make sure that people get a copy of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11524.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11525.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11528.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, there should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11529.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we definitely need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11531.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11560.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very much want to make sure to have an understanding of the impact on our student usage at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11569.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And security, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11570.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11573.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11586.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11586.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11587.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11878.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Going forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11886.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11892.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11900.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that if we if the new superintendent elect has had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11907.363s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11917.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11934.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He just might be very useful in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11937.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: saying how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11938.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them, but if we could reach out to him as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12829.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12865.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12876.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: photographs I was over at Midea one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12878.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've talked extensively to them and they see it as a positive, a win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12884.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Their engineers are having a great time with the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12886.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12891.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like us to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12893.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12901.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: can say that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14628.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for staying so long tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14630.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15810.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just real quick, on the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15818.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we insist that they be paid twice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15825.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15832.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15852.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When are they due?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15860.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it just makes me a little nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15883.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess I'm just suggesting a twice a year collection as opposed to... Again, these were contracts in place, so I didn't have that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2259.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2262.583s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to follow up and I wonder whether you've ever faced this kind of situation at one of the schools that you oversaw or the principal of and what did you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2380.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there any special education students or students with disabilities that you had to make arrangements for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1153.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a technical thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1155.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Under the school committee members, Kathy Kretsch is already listed in the above as a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1173.156s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or you could just put me in parents and community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1181.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1917.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we need to just vote that first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1919.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we'll do a motion to take the out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2764.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2765.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so on the June 1st, I'm just concerned that it's at the very time that we're preparing budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2772.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to understand what works best, whether it's that we do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2777.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the year end, which would be June 30th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2802.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to pick a date that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2805.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Me too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3239.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3240.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3246.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3247.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the report also included information about the finalists that were brought to the school committee by the Superintendent Search Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3257.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those four finalists were Dr Maurice and Ward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3262.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perrella, Dr. Straight, and Mr. Thomas Martelone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3265.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tonight, the committee met prior to this and voted to continue looking into the backgrounds and speaking with Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent and Mr. Thomas Martelone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3279.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3696.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is one of those topics that goes around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3702.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But when I first got involved, the first topic that I brought together a group of parents to talk about was called Leave My Child Alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3711.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was the first forum that we had to discuss this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3717.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's come to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3718.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I absolutely agree that now that the technology that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3723.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: has just brought Atlanta to a whole new level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3726.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, back in, I think it was around 2010, school committee, Anne Marie Pugnell, working with Representative Paul Donato, we did a couple of public forums as well around the topic of polling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3740.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At that point, we did put together a rather extensive policy and some procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3746.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems to me that what we need to do is we need to review those,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3758.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that everybody's on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3760.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's probably time again that we again do a public program about educating parents about bullying and how they can help their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3777.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At that particular point, Ann Marie was working with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4137.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we want to make it a committee of the home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5107.189s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5110.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5332.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just for the response to intervention, do we need any additional monies for planning for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5372.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5373.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5373.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just wondering whether we're going to need to build in more money for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5377.448s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just seemed earlier that when we talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5381.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5415.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's really what I was getting at, because I know some systems do have paid tutors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5421.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5421.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know whether it's something which we can get volunteer tutors or whether we are going to need, because of consistency, to have paid tutors and how much that might cost us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5432.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I just thought that might be a budget item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5455.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5456.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6818.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Anderson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6820.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I understood, you just said a classroom per grade in each school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6825.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6825.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So for the kids who aren't piloting the program, we were concerned about our science curriculum overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6833.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also the ability of kids to do hands-on stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6837.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as we're piloting programs, how are we making sure that the other students who are not piloting the programs have the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6850.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: opportunities as those who are getting the new materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6912.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is your plan to make a new recommendation for whatever program we're going to go with by next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6924.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It can't be too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6932.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not ready to go now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7388.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7392.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just had one more question, and that is, when we do implement FOSS, what is the approximate budget amount that you anticipate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7417.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, we are not moving forward this year because we want to vet it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7425.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7425.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not because we're not, we can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7429.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7431.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just making sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7761.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7763.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8150.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8155.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony, you let us know when we confirm a date for the presentation on anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8162.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's May 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8198.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we need to let you know that we want to come?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8201.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8203.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=267.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=270.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would be helpful if we understood a little bit more about your current job capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=276.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Boston is a little bit unknown to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=280.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so if you could explain exactly what you do in your current position, that would be extremely helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=367.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure if- When you say instructional focus, are you meaning instruction curriculum overall, or are you, is there different instructional methods that differentiate the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=506.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So tell me about one of the biggest challenges in working in your current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=572.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But what is your challenge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2915.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've spoken about some of your successes, but I want to hear how you've been tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2921.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you speak about, I'll say, two occasions where you did not succeed in something or where you actually failed and what you learned from it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2946.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be like an implementation of a program not going well or an interaction with a student's family for something, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3096.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3097.73s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3098.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3099.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3100.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3101.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3103.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we've touched a little bit on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3105.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3107.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3111.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you balance the emotional needs of the students while maintaining academic rigor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3117.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And can you give me any specific examples how you've handled that in your schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5693.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of them, but they're short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5696.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5698.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you did your superintendent training, did you have experience with a particular budget in a particular community during that training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5711.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, just, I didn't know if you worked with a particular mentor in a particular community that did budget with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5717.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5730.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not during your time in Boston, but when you did your superintendent training classes, did you work with a mentor outside of Boston at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5755.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5757.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Next question is, if you could go to the Board of Education tomorrow and advocate for change, what would you be talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5825.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what other measures would you like to use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5884.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8598.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Dr. Martelone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8600.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed in your resume that there was a year when you went over to the dark side and you worked at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8609.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you tell us what brought you there and what you learned during that year and why you left?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8881.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you speak to a time when you had to address parents about a difficult event that took place in a school that you were overseeing or a change that you had to implement that was unpopular where you had to address parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11584.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11585.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sarusa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1427.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to get more, to get to know you a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1431.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1431.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'd like to know what are the core values that define you in your work and how do they affect the way you do your jobs as an administrator and a leader?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2970.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pass over the question I planned at the moment just to be able to follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2975.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like you to speak more specifically to your experience in grant writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2980.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a grant or grants you could tell us about that you identified and followed up with either, you know, with a group of people but that really you consider to be your success?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3052.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was that a grant from the DESC?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3059.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How did you identify that grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3109.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3112.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3758.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dr. Strait, I would like to know what being an educational leader means to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3764.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3769.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or, or and, if you could tomorrow, what would you like to address them on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3925.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this took place when I was living in- Just FinCom is financial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5259.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Strait, when we put together the application, I kept on thinking that we really ought to put one of those warning boxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5267.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the warning box would say that our current superintendent is available 24-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5271.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And he works around the clock, and we can always get him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5276.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And he's been on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5278.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've talked to him when he's on vacation, which is a rarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5282.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, quite honestly, we're just used to that accessibility to our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5288.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to warn you, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5294.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5296.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want you to understand what our expectation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5300.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because quite honestly, no joking aside, that really is quite a difficult place to follow on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5308.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said that, I'd like you to know what you do for fun, and what you do in your way, and how you de-stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5395.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5399.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6495.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perella, decision-making is a two-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6498.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some situations call for decisiveness right at the start while others involved consensus building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6505.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tell us about a situation where you were decisive and how it worked out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6508.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Then tell us about the time when you weren't decisive enough and what you learned from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6616.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So John, why don't you speak to some accomplishment that you've done through collaboration and why you particularly see that as successful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6674.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6675.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6676.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7749.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7753.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7892.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John, what does being an educational leader mean to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7897.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue, or if you could, or and if you could, if you could go before them tomorrow, what would you address them on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8026.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8028.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sebastian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10009.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that you've done here, and it's easy to, it really wasn't that long ago, but it feels longer ago, was that you oversaw the reconstruction of the science labs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10020.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as superintendent, there's the educational leadership, there's the budget, there's negotiations, and there's also keeping up with the buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10030.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What was the most challenging aspect of having a major building project in the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10036.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what did you learn from the experience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10224.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, John, you gave me a perfect segue because in your answer you mentioned anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10229.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other question I really wanted to ask you tonight was about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10232.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10237.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we balance the emotional needs of students while maintaining academic rigor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10243.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if you could give me any, obviously because of confidentiality, I want to be very careful, but could you give me examples of how we can do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1023.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I don't have any problem with having a committee of the whole to discuss the payroll questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1030.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have a huge problem with the feeling that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1037.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some wrongdoing, the charge of wrongdoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1040.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's, just going to be very clear, I'm going to vote for the meeting because I think it's always appropriate for us to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1047.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm not, there's, I'm going with an open mind to hear explanations, which I believe will be reasonable explanations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1057.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and have always been in my, when I've gone and asked specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1062.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But having a committee of the whole is, it's no big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1065.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why, why not spend yet another night together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2112.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2114.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just great, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2116.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work and the work, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2117.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2119.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's easy to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2122.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking, of course, just that it just makes things so clear and it's great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2130.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3226.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that it's not been unusual over the years for the school committee to occasionally comment on something that's coming before the city council and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3235.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The city council also comments on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3237.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: stuff that comes beyond us, so I feel comfortable in supporting the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3244.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see the library as an essential element in any community, and I particularly want it to be a beautiful library in mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3250.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we all know that the library needs some updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3253.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not particularly a surprise or a shock to any of us who have been in it, and we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3260.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we would like to see improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3264.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think in terms of being members of the school committee, it just goes hand in hand with our caring about and dedication to our Medford children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3272.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate the resolution and I certainly will support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3290.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4347.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, again, I just wanted to add my thanks to Mr. Tucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4352.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also just to say that parents came before us at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4358.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was difficult because we didn't respond to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4360.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't say anything about, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4363.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After they left, I said, I just want to say I hear your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4366.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we really, we did hear their concerns and took appropriate action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4371.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4372.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm glad the open house went so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4375.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My colleague, Mr. Russo and the mayor, we were, we were off at the superintendent search committee that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4382.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I didn't get to go, but I'm glad that it went so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4810.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that kind of answers part of my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4815.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How much is the McGlynn trip this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4914.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4914.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandiver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4915.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, just I think that ultimately taking that step also so that the kids then get to meet each other before they go on to high school, you know, and there will be familiar faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4925.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly that is the progression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4928.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope the kids and the chaperones have a wonderful time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4939.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We kind of like to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5445.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5448.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I too was surprised to hear how long this training was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5453.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At my workplace, Winchester Hospital, just up the road, Winchester police came in and did run, hide, fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5463.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And those are the three words that you use, run, hide, fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5466.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seemed much more targeted and concise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5469.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally will be speaking with Officer Convino so I understand the differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5474.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we might also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5477.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if he's planning on coming to your subcommittee meeting, but if not, perhaps he could come to another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5485.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, just because we've been using Alice because it's kind of been the original catch word, but I'm not sure that's the only approach, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5495.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little puzzled about the time commitment, because it does seem extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5502.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also wondered whether Officer Covino has, for Rennheide Fight, we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5506.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there's a movie, which is maybe 15 minutes long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5514.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think if there's a way for the committee to access that video so we can see it too, would be very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5521.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will reach out to him myself to ask my questions around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5526.889s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe if he could be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6374.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6375.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask if you could recall when the deadline for the Connors scholarship is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6801.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that all my questions have been covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6804.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=648.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=650.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=651.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we rush to approve that, I just, I have some questions for my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=654.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, first of all, and I, uh, Christine, um, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=670.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that something you can easily get to us, or is this going to cause a great deal more work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=747.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=748.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we know what we have a yearly budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=753.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in that yearly budget, we're given the yearly pay rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=757.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it sounds as if my colleague is looking for something specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=762.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if she's looking for something specific, then perhaps it would be wiser to zone down into it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1015.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1016.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1017.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I have a concern because I haven't seen this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1020.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't feel like there's, we've been doing it this way for many, many, many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1028.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps it's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1030.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I believe that I want to understand what exactly we would see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1035.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wouldn't want anybody's confidential information now coming to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1039.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm very concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1041.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to table this until our next school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1051.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1561.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1562.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderkle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1563.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So first, I know that you guys did a lot of work over the past weekends, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1570.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am a little concerned, whatever,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1575.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: school committee last week also voted that we wanted to set up a parent advisory committee on security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1581.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to make sure that we're working, that your group is working in tandem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1586.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we've yet appointed anybody, but I just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1589.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1590.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did have any idea who was going to be on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1592.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would sure make sense for them to attend next Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1596.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, I do need, as the former curriculum, I do want to point out that you and I had talked many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1602.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was really tough to schedule a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1604.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have emails where back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1607.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that we should go ahead now and send it to the curriculum committee again, which now Erin is the head of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1615.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And maybe we'll have better luck this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1617.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just need to say in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1620.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You and I talked many times, and I could show you those e-mails, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1624.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1730.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1731.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually concur because I saw the difficulty in trying to do it as a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1736.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reason why we didn't just remind people was because there's six of us and we each have one subcommittee and then I think in the past it was, well, everybody wanted to be on that subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1748.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've now already had differentiated with a subcommittee for selection committee, so I actually think that doing a separate committee makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2353.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2353.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2355.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anthony, thanks for your good work last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2357.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2358.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't expect anything less from you, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2360.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2361.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2362.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of the vacation week camps, are we doing another one in April?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2390.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly understand that, but it may be that we should look at to see if there's someone else who could do it, since it does fulfill a need in our community at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2401.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was curious, during the winter February vacation, did the students use the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2427.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2428.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3025.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3027.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane, I have a relationship with one of the Burlington elementary teachers, and that's what really sparked my interest, our long conversations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3038.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do know that she said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3041.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The tutors were extremely helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3043.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I also, and I'll check back with her, but I wondered whether, is this something you could, could you train any volunteers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3052.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is it too extensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3078.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3080.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3080.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3423.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please tell me how many students are signed up to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3440.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3441.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3455.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3699.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3699.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3702.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we are under suspension, I wanted to talk about our subcommittee meeting, Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3710.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So typically, we send things to subcommittee meetings, but Mr. Ruggiero has proposed that we have a subcommittee meeting on community outreach this Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3723.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And perhaps I could just ask you to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3726.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that the rest of the committee knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3730.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had asked that there be a preliminary meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3734.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like timing is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3736.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mr. Ruggiero, I just want to mention that it needs to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3741.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that means you need to contact the superintendent's office to have that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3787.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure we officially post it towards our regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3797.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you announce what the agenda is for the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3847.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay I'm certainly hoping to be there planning to be there, but you know sometimes I would do work in an environment which can be tricky Thank you for the information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4090.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4091.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4092.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure, though, that we received one report which had the name of a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4100.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to make sure that it's deducted, because we should not have that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4106.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, we do have a protocol for, what's it called, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4111.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4113.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A protocol when a student says something or is of concern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4118.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a safety care, and I think that we should remind everybody that that is in existence and in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4125.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If, in fact, a student makes some kind of threat, but the safety care protocol is followed, then while the school committee can be informed, I just, I received one robo-call from a principal, and I wondered how, if nothing was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4146.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if there was no reason to be concerned after professionals had assessed the child, and it was an elementary school child, and kids will be kids and say things, that I didn't want to, I think there's a balance between what some would call transparency, and my concern would be heightened<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4173.024s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just wondering where the line is so it's not too much and it's not inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4177.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that we're protecting our students appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4182.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think it's a balance that we need to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4187.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we probably need a little practice with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4189.074s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do think that we put in place a couple of years ago the safety protocol for assessing situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4196.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we need to make sure that we're sticking to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4199.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if nothing is determined, and it was by Elliot, then I don't think that there's a reason to alert every parent that a third grader said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4212.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because sometimes third graders say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4214.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, they're kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4216.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They're kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4217.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to recognize that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4219.797s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In our concern about safety, we also need to be concerned about safety<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4230.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and worried about or realizing the impact on the fact that these are children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4329.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And will you be bringing that to us at our next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4335.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4336.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get it done by then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4337.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5773.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to add my voice to thanking all of your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5778.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I, you know, attend as many concerts as I possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5781.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know Mrs. Kreatz and I and some other members were at the winter concerts and, you know, you listen to the orchestra concert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5790.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the thing that makes me, I think, so proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5795.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: when I can talk to other people and say, yes, all of our kids get to, you know, try out stringed instruments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5803.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then they can do something in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5805.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And people really are amazed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5806.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I tell them how many people we have in our orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5810.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the band concert, the winter band concert, it was just blow your socks off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5816.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: just so I wish everybody had been able to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5818.979s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really appreciate all the hard work of your teachers and yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5822.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5823.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5869.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5870.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5870.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question because I understand that, um, the, um, that there's going to be an election or preliminary election and is it the first day of school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5916.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we would have school on September 4th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5920.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: or school would be in session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5943.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm just a little concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5946.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The students grade 1 to 12 go back the 28th, 29th, 30th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5951.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: then they're off Friday, they're off Monday, and then Tuesday would be the election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5958.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, clearly when we think about concerns about security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5961.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, I think we need to think this through and look at that particular date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5967.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if any other members have thought about this yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5972.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to leave them out of school for, it seems difficult to leave them out of school for another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5978.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but I was a little concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6172.716s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have had school before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6175.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we have school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6182.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: people who come in to vote at the schools are segregated from completely?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6188.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6189.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6248.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6248.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not just one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6252.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, when do kindergarteners go back to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6257.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, beginning September 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6261.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, beginning September 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6263.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the day that we're talking about is September 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6266.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6268.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we set the voting machines up in the kindergartners, kindergartens at all at the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6274.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6275.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, because I mean, if you can think of, is there a way just to isolate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6279.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just looking at a way to isolate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6298.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the rest of the calendar, I think that the only question that we have a concern about is September 4th and how to deal with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6305.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess for you it impacts the other day, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6309.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we hold it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7049.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Miss Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7050.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Technically, it's supposed to come in by Wednesday, by noon, although I know that there is a certain amount of leeway that's usually granted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7060.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But just people need to be aware that our packets are received on Friday, so that it, you know, they can't come in at Friday at 5 and expect it to go out to us in a timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7281.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7282.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little bit troubled just how, um, when we just had people before us, we wanted to be clear that we couldn't deliberate on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7292.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just wanted to add a sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7294.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that I would have added earlier if I had realized that we're going to walk away at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7297.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, um, I just, it just the fact that we have it deliberated on it doesn't mean that we didn't hear the parents and their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7305.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's an important distinction to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7306.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly we've been C receiving emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7309.334s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we're, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7312.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we're, I'm sure that every school committee member, if I can dare to speak for the body, is concerned about this issue and waiting to, we can't make a decision here or whatever, but I think that there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7329.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that I would like to say that I heard them and have heard from parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7336.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there is a better solution or whatnot, I'm sure that's something that we might take up at a different point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7345.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=978.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=979.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1353.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, thank you for everybody who's written to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1357.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No matter what side of the issue you're on, I know that everybody was very upset and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1368.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can disagree with the superintendent's decision, which many of us did, but you still know he is a good man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1376.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He has served this community well, and it was important as we figured out what we were trying to do or how we would go forward that we needed both a place where we could begin to mend this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1390.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we could support our teachers and administrators who serve us every day and we could go forward and also appreciate the fact that the superintendent has served us for 50 years and many of us, you know, really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1408.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you measure a man?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1411.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it a moment of a decision you disagree with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1416.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is it the totality?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1418.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As we looked at the decision today, for me, it was the totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1423.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's just what I'd like to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=477.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just for clarification, so for this initial step, all we need to do is submit this statement of interest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=484.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=484.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't need to submit any more detailed report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=509.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we say, currently the building has many tiles that have asbestos flooring or many places which, while safe, when it is sealed, our intention would be to replace it, we don't need to give the number of square feet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=522.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, not at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1344.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I read your report, and I think I understand the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1348.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the public, we had some really cold days in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1353.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so how has that affected our utility usage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1400.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1774.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1786.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question to follow up on Mr. Russo's question really is, is for the students who are in the sixth grade, are we looking at their math scores, the ones who came from the Columbus, are we looking at their math scores and seeing whether any of them need extra tutoring or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1802.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1803.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1803.99s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1981.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1983.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you forward on to the committee members a copy of the flyer highlighting all the benefits students receive from applying for free or reduced lunch?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1993.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1995.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would be valuable for us to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1996.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2004.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2272.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2273.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perlow, I wanted to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2275.073s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a great presentation, and I was very happy I had the opportunity to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2281.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Apart from the information that was presented on vaping, I also want to mention that I thought it was fantastic that we had students available to act as interpreters that night for people in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2293.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was just a great, great touch and something we should continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2297.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And even if they weren't utilized, I don't know how much they were utilized that particular night, but the fact that they were available for people who needed translation was terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2308.876s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2790.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hate to say this, but there's a spelling mistake on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2795.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2795.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm glad you told me today, not tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2797.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you go down to the last line where it says notification,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2801.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The word signatures is spelled wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1255.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1255.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1257.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1258.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that two teachers were present, teachers Robin Irving and Patty Haas had come forward and spoke about a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1266.011s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it was to the Museum of Science, which didn't end up taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1269.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or did it end up taking place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1272.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1300.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to make sure that the kids get to go on the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1304.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand it's a traditional field trip, and the kids are going to the Museum of Science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1308.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to make sure that because of this timing with the paperwork, that they're not held back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1314.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if there's a cost differential that was caused by this, that we look deep into our budget and see if we can help make that go away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1328.015s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it was a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5696.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5696.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5697.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank Cheryl for all the work that she's done on this and for bringing this again to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5703.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This has been something that we talked about the last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5706.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've done some patching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5707.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it clearly is something, it's an expensive project when we go citywide to all of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5715.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly appreciate her work on this to try to see if some funding could be gotten for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6371.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just a little concerned that we're doing the focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6377.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And are there dates and times set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6379.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, how are parents going to know about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6414.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6414.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and like for teachers, are they during the day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6419.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He's going to be around for a couple of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6438.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6438.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'm particularly interested in the ones that open to the community members and to parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6443.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's probably going to be the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6444.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the evening of the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6537.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to have any opportunity for people to come before us and make statements at a school committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6553.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6554.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As part of people, well, a focus group is one way of having discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6559.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A public hearing is another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6562.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, you're sort of thinking about the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6566.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the focus group says all encompass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6568.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6569.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=409.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=410.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=411.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually was the one who signed this particular warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=415.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And every time we go in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=419.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's different groups of bills, and the activities account will say whether a club ordered pizza, whether money is put aside for the senior special day or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=432.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So all of the bills are separate, but they're lump-summed in this one account when it reports out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=440.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, the secretary, who's now Kathy, of course, will see every bill and sign the lump sum, but she sees every single one that we sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=637.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the meeting was called to order by myself at seven o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=642.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All the school committee members were present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=643.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I stated at the beginning that this was elected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=648.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The organizational meeting was to elect a vice chairperson and a secretary for the year 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=653.311s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also that this was the only official task of the senior member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=659.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=659.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kreatz, seconded by Mayor Burke, placed the name of Mia Mastone in nomination for the position of vice chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=665.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The roll call was called, and Mia was universally nominated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=672.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=672.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mustone put the name of Kathy Kritz, seconded by Mayor Burke, into nomination for the position of secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=681.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she was nominated for that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=687.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we adjourned the meeting at 7 to 1 under new leadership, and it went great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=716.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1279.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1281.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank Cheryl for coming before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1284.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cheryl, you're great at searching out opportunities to get money for the students at the Robertson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1290.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1673.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1673.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1675.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1676.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention, though, and I'm all for the MASC taking over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1682.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we voted on it last week, I put it forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1685.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I do think that there is a cost incurred, and it's an appropriate cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1690.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that all of these services are completely free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1693.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So since you said free, I just don't want to mislead anybody in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1706.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think he gave us the number around 9,000 or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1724.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1733.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1793.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1793.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure we'll have an opportunity later on to congratulate Mrs. DiCarlo and thank her for her work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1799.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I can't let the moment pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1802.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's been an asset to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1804.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's a great lady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1806.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we will certainly need to celebrate her tenure with us and her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2553.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2555.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Recently the DESC put out some new, I don't know, they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2573.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: had an elongated time out, there was an option other than tacking on school days at the end or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2581.737s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't read it completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2583.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was thinking that we would be talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2587.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I definitely think, though I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access the work that the teachers prepare for them and that is tricky in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2600.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2607.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2615.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2624.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see this not so much for the one or two day absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2627.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see this in the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2629.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard, that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2967.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2967.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2968.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So yes, I just wanted to formalize my thought then and along with Erin's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2973.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to ask that the curriculum subcommittee review the recent DESC paper on alternatives for snow days so that we can begin this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3073.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3075.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to congratulate our representative from the high school, Sebastian Tringali, on his recent acceptance to Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3092.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It means he'll be nice and close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4034.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4034.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4035.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have first, the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that it also included all of those booster clubs or athletic support groups as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4048.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think September 1st is a bad day to pick because it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4053.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: off on Labor Day weekend, I think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4062.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4069.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like, Mr. Superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4077.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4080.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4082.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We just can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4084.037s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4085.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4090.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, of which I belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4102.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4106.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to put that out there and say, makes me real nervous when you went down that path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4112.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't think it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4115.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4122.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because, for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation, we don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4127.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a principal sign-off sheet, however, we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4136.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4140.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4147.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4154.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, how formally you play them out is another thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4156.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws, because if you're a 501c3,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4162.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You needed to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4163.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You needed to specify how the offices worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4169.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4180.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, otherwise than that, I think that we can send it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4183.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But those were some of my initial concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4288.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before you move on, though, I do know that there are members of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4298.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4559.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4559.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4560.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4577.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: raise money for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4580.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that, how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4598.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: money is raised that the kids get the opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4601.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just think that it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4604.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, many of you won't remember this and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4610.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4620.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts, because way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4635.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they were all, blessedly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4637.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4643.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4648.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So within all of this and this discussion, by putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5556.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5556.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5559.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5571.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You meant to be speaking up for parents, and in fact, were responding to parents' requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5577.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5578.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5582.861s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5586.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you meant to be heavy-handed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5588.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you meant to cause this uproar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5591.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think so at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5593.085s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think you were inexperienced, and frankly, you learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5598.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because you see, you know that it's caused great upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5603.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was very evident the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5607.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We agree that we've now got some new things that have come out of this, maybe, and maybe that's all for the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5613.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there were some really hurt feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5618.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The treasurer has asked for an apology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5620.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Saying I'm sorry doesn't cost you anything, and it would help to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5627.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that you didn't mean to hurt, but frankly, you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5634.711s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5636.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's happened to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5637.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't mean to, but it did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5640.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I said, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5641.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes those two little words are just the easiest thing to say if they're heartfelt and meant, because I truly believe, I truly believe that you meant no harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5652.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I look forward to working with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5655.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I look forward to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5657.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: figuring out what it means to be a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5659.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You and I have already had some discussions about personal styles, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5664.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in my view, it is time to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5668.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in order for that to happen, you need to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6844.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion, which I thought Mr. Ruggiero might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6851.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Today, Mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information, and I think that there was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6864.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One piece, which I was uncomfortable with, which actually had to do with the ski trip, it didn't have names on it, but if there was names, I wanted that to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6873.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't certain that I wanted everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going, what time they were going, whatever, just as a safety thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6882.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6884.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's long been a thought that I know other school committee members share, that some of our documents, rather than having this big stack of papers, could be online for us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6899.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think that we should take both things together, figure out, there were some questions about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6909.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: afterwards, which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6913.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6921.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to effectively put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6938.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: minimize the amount of paper that we have for our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6944.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist, and frankly, it's just way too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6975.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, I made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6976.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we want to just officialize it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6989.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6990.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll include that in the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=31.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All please rise and salute our flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=32.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Welcome, Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=287.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mr. Zigny, before you and the students go, first I want to tell you how much I was looking forward to hearing you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=294.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's made our night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=295.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=297.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will also tell you it made our night when we went to the orchestra concert at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=302.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you could get another student on that stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=305.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=307.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As well, myself and some of my colleagues, including the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=310.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Kathy Kreatz, we were able to go to the middle school concert as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=313.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just, I felt so proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=316.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so proud of our students here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=318.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You represent us so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=319.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's so magnificent that we have this interest in our music program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=323.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=325.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=326.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, Mr. Zigny, though, I actually happen to have something I have to give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=329.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you wouldn't mind coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=331.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is kind of funny, but I just happen to be given a donation of drumsticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=336.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and from someone who was formally connected and did a student internship at Medford High, and he remembers us so fondly, so here's some drumsticks for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=695.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=696.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto, if I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=698.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=699.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so you know, that as secretary, when I sign that, I look through every single one of them to make sure they're proper and in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=706.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they consistently have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=708.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=709.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=713.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=770.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You want to do it under report of committees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=783.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would, Mrs. Cugno, I think that tonight it would be appropriate to just quickly say that we met at 6.30 on December 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=794.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All of us were present, as well as Michael Ruggiero, school committee elect, Paul Rousseau, school committee elect,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=801.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent, deputy superintendent, director of curriculum, Bernard Riccadeli, and community members, Jen Graham, Michelle Ciccolo, and Franco Leary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=811.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The purpose of the meeting was to establish a process for the selection of the next superintendent, to identify the criteria for selection, to review application forms for candidates, and to initiate a process for selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=825.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent spoke about different items, going over what our challenges would be, what its job description should be, giving us some information about the MASS, that's Massachusetts Superintendent Organization, salary information, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=842.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The outcome of this meeting was that the mayor appointed a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=854.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't say here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=856.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=863.781s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we are going to meet this Thursday, December 21st at 715 up at the high school to carry forward our charge of coming up with a questionnaire and also a information document that could be given out to prospective candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=888.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: PM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=890.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=891.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had talked about AM, so it's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=893.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1520.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1521.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1522.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that in our folders, we also received all the other things, all the other plans, adding 15 minutes of math instruction daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1535.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Chromebook practice so that we had a further report which covered additional in-school items that would be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1549.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It also, though I just wanted to clarify, and Mr. Superintendent, I know we're being redundant here, but I understand that you're now committed to having a after school tutoring for the math students paid for by the district, because I'm just clarifying that, because earlier there was a rumor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1570.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I want to put that to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1572.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And committed to working out transportation, after school transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1577.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like so far, financially, you've committed to at least two days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1583.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1584.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that your request would have preferred three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1586.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think two is probably a reasonable place to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1589.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1591.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1592.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would like to thank you very much from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1595.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've been very, very concerned about this issue, Maureen, and I thank you for coming forth and addressing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1603.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And see, I told you it'd be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1605.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing, too, is, though, I think that when I went and first met Maureen at the math night, one of the things that just stood out so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1616.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: much that night was when I had a great discussion with some of the teachers, and they were telling me about all the different things our math program could do, but then admitted that not every student had access to that at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1627.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So by providing this after school time, this gives them an opportunity to utilize those, our math program to the full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1635.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you, Maureen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2012.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4251.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I think tonight we've seen, you know, heard about three different projects, which are very different, and I thank you so much for coming forward and telling us about your project, and girls also, about your projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4265.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you look at the project portfolio that the school committee members received, the scope of the projects is really just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4271.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it makes me, again, feel so very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4275.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because here we have kids coming up with projects, all sorts of different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4278.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What a wonderful idea to have role models come in and speak to our students and for you to be interested in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4285.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then, you know, I read another one, one of our students, and I suspect we'll hear from her gladly so, is concerned about the styrofoam that we use for trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4295.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I could go through each one because there are so many positive, wonderful projects that kids came up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4302.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And not just came up with, but then went forward and said, we're going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4305.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4306.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that you've already made a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4309.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm so proud that you're making a difference in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4311.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4312.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just grateful that the CCSR has flourished and taken off, especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4319.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that the leadership has been extraordinarily positive and helpful in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4324.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I thank them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4325.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5482.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5483.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5486.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the front page, you say we'll cap the charges at three meals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5491.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for middle and high school students and five for elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5495.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But then if I understand it, they can still take a regular meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5542.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out, first of all, in terms of the alternate lunch, are cheese sandwiches an option for all the time for everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5555.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, because one of the things that we worked hard is not to signal students out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5582.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So three days in a row is pretty short time, is what I'm concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5589.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just thinking about for a family who's got a sort of short-term crisis, I mean... In regard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5645.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5646.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, obviously my concern is for the student who might have not yet signed up for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5652.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: reduced price lunch or something, but all of a sudden there's a crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5657.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wouldn't want them to be in any way signaled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5661.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is consistent, you say, with other school districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5664.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to have- We have to have a charge policy, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5667.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll be curious, yeah, what other people think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5973.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that having some threshold where the account is followed up on, that's not a problem for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5983.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I definitely think that all of a sudden the kid goes through the line and they get a different meal is a problem for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5992.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would rather them still be able to take their regular meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5996.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6001.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, because it still shows up, and there's still, the follow-up would still be necessary, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6008.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, they would be in a negative capacity going through the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6012.091s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it says here, I mean, because there's a punishment instated in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6016.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The child will be allowed to take a meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6018.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that meal will be continued to be charged to the account at the standard lunch rate based on their meal benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6023.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if the meal is three and a quarter, even though they're getting a cheese sandwich rather than chicken nuggets, they're being charged the same three and a quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6031.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there is a punishment there, and I'm not comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6080.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I understand that it's important for us to have some thresholds so that parents are contacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6086.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand that the alternative lunch is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6090.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: meets the same criteria, but I'm not comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6093.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm comfortable with saying, OK, flag the account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6100.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to talk to the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6102.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6103.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6104.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm not comfortable with changing the lunch for the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6109.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That just doesn't sit well with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8720.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to thank Dr. Perella for being proactive on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8724.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8726.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I remember when vaping was considered to be healthier than cigarette smoking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8732.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the idea was that you were stepping down if you were vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8736.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And clearly when you presented the last time and mentioned jeweling and the amount of nicotine, I was shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8742.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And clearly this has taken on a new concern for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8746.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8747.56s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8932.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8933.641s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I've been thinking about this for the last couple of weeks and really wondering what to say to my esteemed colleagues who are leaving us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8944.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I'm going to turn to Robert Emmett Scurry, who's been sitting next to me for an awfully long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8953.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've shared many different instances, but amongst our colleagues from the back, and some of these names won't mean anything to some of you, but some of them will mean a great deal to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8965.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we sat with Bill Brady, Lena DiGiantomaso, the esteemed Fred Pompeo, Mary Alabirdy, Carol Sharpton, Fred Lasky, Jack the Bulldog Buckley,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8982.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ed Nolan, Ron Vining, Beth Fuller, Sharon Guzik, Bill O'Keefe, the Honorable Mike McGlynn, and now our current colleagues, Erin, Mia, Kathy, Anne Marie, and of course, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9000.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if I got everybody, but I think I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9004.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And through that, we've had a lot of different experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9011.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With Lena, we were climbing on roofs of buildings to check out the roofs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9018.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we had many, many long evenings as we prepared for building new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9024.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suspect, Bob, like me, your proudest moments come when you go see your name on those plaques in the new schools, because those were incredible, an incredible period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9037.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bob, you and I haven't always gotten along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9040.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not always on the same page, but I know and have never doubted that your heart is in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9047.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this position here and your commitment to Medford and to the students of Medford has meant everything to you and that you have given a great deal of time and energy to the city of Medford and the children of Medford and our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9062.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9065.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Almost four decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9067.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Colleague, I'm not quite sure what it's going to be like sitting here without you, and I'm going to miss you, but I know that you will take your time and commitment and energy working on behalf of students in Medford will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9081.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9084.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, Mrs. Cugno, you've not been here quite as long as Mr. Scurry, but your impact has been huge over the last, is it 12?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9093.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9094.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in that time, we also got to see your family grow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9098.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9100.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because those boys, they were in elementary school way back when, and now they're in college or beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9107.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really been quite an amazing ride, Anne Marie, hasn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9115.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9120.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in that ride, one has to say, I mean, through all of the different things, of course, like with Mr. Scurry, the building of the new schools was just an amazing project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9130.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so many meetings, so many, so many meetings that we spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9136.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: talking about the bigger picture and then the small picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9140.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the small picture was the color of the paint, the location of the switches, and then the bigger issues of equity, which was so, so, so important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9153.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you were part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9154.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You were a very big part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9156.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it fueled your becoming a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9163.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we were all grateful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9165.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You went on, though, to be very active on the state level, first by becoming the head of the division two for the MASC, Massachusetts Association of School Committee, and then working your way up to an incredible year as being president of the MASC and representing Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9185.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I quite honestly believe that, sorry,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9189.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Most of my colleagues here don't really realize what you did during the course of that period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9195.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I was fortunate to sit on the board with Anne-Marie and be able to experience her leadership and the amount of work and travel that it took over that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9207.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Anne-Marie, maybe, luckily, my voice is giving out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9212.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to thank you as a friend and as a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9215.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9217.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that you will be continuing to give your heart and your love to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=278.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mr. Zigny, before you and the students go, first I want to tell you how much I was looking forward to hearing you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=285.465s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's made our night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=286.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=288.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I will also tell you it made our night when we went to the orchestra concert at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=293.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you could get another student on that stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=296.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=298.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As well, myself and some of my colleagues, including the mayor and Kathy Kreatz, we were able to go to the middle school concert as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=304.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just, I felt so proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=307.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so proud of our students here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=316.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=317.013s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, Mr. Zigny, though, I actually happen to have something I have to give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=320.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you wouldn't mind coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=322.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is kind of funny, but I just happen to be given a donation of drumsticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=329.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: from someone who was formally connected and did a student internship at Medford High, and he remembers us so fondly, so here's some drumsticks for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=815.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent spoke about different items, going over what our challenges would be, what its job description should be, giving us some information about the MASS, that's Massachusetts Superintendent Organization, salary information, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=854.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we are going to meet this Thursday, December 21st at 715 up at the high school to carry forward our charge of coming up with a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=869.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: questionnaire and also a information document that could be given out to prospective candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=881.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=883.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had talked about a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=884.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: so it's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1509.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1509.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1511.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, a couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1513.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that in our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1517.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Folders we also received all the other things which are all the other plans adding 15 minutes of math instruction daily And Chromebook practice so that we had a further report which covered additional in school items That would be addressed It also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1542.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: though, I just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1544.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mr. Superintendent, I know we're being redundant here, but I understand that you're now committed to having a after school tutoring for the math students paid for by the district, because I'm just clarifying that, because earlier there was a rumor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1561.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I want to put that to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1563.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and committed to working out transportation, after school transportation, it sounds like so far, financially, you've committed to at least two days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1572.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1574.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1575.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that your request would have preferred three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1577.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think two is probably a reasonable place to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1581.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1582.191s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1583.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would like to thank you very much from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1586.735s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've been very, very concerned about this issue, Maureen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1591.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thank you for coming forth and addressing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1594.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And see, I told you it'd be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1596.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing, too, is, though, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1599.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I went and first met Maureen at the math night, one of the things that just stood out so much that night was when I had a great discussion with some of the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1611.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they were telling me about all the different things our math program could do, but then admitted that not every student had access to that at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1618.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So by providing this after school time, this gives them an opportunity to utilize our math program to the full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1626.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent, and thank you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1629.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maureen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1995.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Berger?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4243.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I think tonight we've heard about three different projects, which are very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4248.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thank you so much for coming forward and telling us about your project, and girls also, about your projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4256.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When you look at the project portfolio that the school committee members received, the scope of the projects is really just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4263.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It makes me, again, feel so very proud because here we have kids coming up with projects, all sorts of different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4270.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What a wonderful idea to have role models come in and speak to our students and for you to be interested in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4277.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I read another one, one of our students, and I suspect we'll hear from her gladly so, is concerned about the styrofoam that we use for trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4286.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I could go through each one because there were so many positive, wonderful projects that kids came up with, and not just came up with, but then went forward and said, we're going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4296.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4297.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that you've already made a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4300.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm so proud that you're making a difference in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4302.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very, very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4304.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just grateful that the CCSR has flourished and taken off, especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4311.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that the leadership has been extraordinarily positive and helpful in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4315.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I thank them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4316.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5471.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5476.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On the front page, you say we'll cap the charges at three meals for middle and high school students and five for elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5486.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But then if I understand it, they can still take a regular meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5534.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out, first of all, in terms of the alternate lunch, are cheese sandwiches<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5540.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: An option for all the time for everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5546.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, because one of the things that we worked hard is not to signal students out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5573.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So three days in a row is pretty short time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5579.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is what I'm concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5580.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just thinking about for a family who's got a sort of short-term crisis, I mean...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5637.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, obviously my concern is for the student who might have not yet signed up for a reduced price lunch or something, but all of a sudden there's a crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5648.616s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wouldn't want them to be in any way signaled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5652.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is consistent, you say, with other school districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5655.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5656.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to have a charge policy, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5658.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll be curious what other people think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5963.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5964.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that having some threshold where the account is followed up on, that's not a problem for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5974.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I definitely think that all of a sudden the kid goes through the line and they get a different meal is a problem for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5982.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would rather them still be able to take the regular meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5992.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, because it still shows up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5994.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The follow-up would still be necessary, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6003.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it says here, I mean, because there's a punishment instated in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6007.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The child will be allowed to take a meal, and that meal will continue to be charged to the account at the standard lunch rate based on their meal benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6014.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if the meal is three and a quarter, even though they're getting a cheese sandwich rather than chicken nuggets, they're being charged the same three and a quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6022.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there is a punishment there, and I'm not comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6071.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I understand that it's important for us to have some thresholds so that parents are contacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6077.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand that the alternative lunch meets the same criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6083.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm not comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6084.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Substitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6085.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't substitute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6087.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm comfortable with saying, OK, flag the account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6091.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to talk to the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6093.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6094.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6095.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm not comfortable with changing the lunch for the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6100.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That just doesn't sit well with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8710.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8711.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van Der Poot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8711.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to thank Dr. Perella for being proactive on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8715.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8716.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I remember when vaping was considered to be healthier than cigarette smoking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8723.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the idea was that you were stepping down if you were vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8727.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly, when you presented the last time and mentioned jeweling and the amount of nicotine, I was shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8733.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And clearly, this has taken on a new concern for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8737.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8738.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8920.407s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8920.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8923.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8924.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I've been thinking about this for the last couple of weeks and really wondering what to say to my esteemed colleagues who are leaving us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8935.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I'm going to turn to Robert Emmett Scurry, who's been sitting next to me for an awfully long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8944.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've shared many different instances, but amongst our colleagues from the back, and some of these names won't mean anything to some of you, but some of them will mean a great deal to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8956.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we sat with Bill Brady, Lena DiGiantomaso, the esteemed Fred Pompeo, Mary Alabirdy, Carol Sharpton, Fred Lasky, Jack the Bulldog Buckley,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8973.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ed Nolan, Ron Vining, Beth Fuller, Sharon Guzik, Bill O'Keefe, the Honorable Mike McGlynn, and now our current colleagues, Erin, Mia, Kathy, Anne Marie, and of course Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8991.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if I got everybody, but I think I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8995.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And through that, we've had a lot of different experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9002.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: With Lena, we were climbing on roofs of buildings to check out the roofs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9009.027s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we had many, many long evenings as we prepared for building new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9015.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suspect, Bob, like me, your proudest moments come when you go see your name on those plaques in the new schools, because those were incredible, an incredible period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9028.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bob, you and I haven't always gotten along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9031.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not always on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9034.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I know and have never doubted that your heart is in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9038.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this position here and your commitment to Medford and to the students of Medford has meant everything to you and that you have given a great deal of time and energy to the city of Medford and the children of Medford and our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9053.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9054.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Almost four decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9056.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Almost four decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9058.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Colleague, I'm not quite sure what it's going to be like sitting here without you, and I'm going to miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9064.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I know that you will take your time and commitment and energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9069.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Working on behalf of students in Medford will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9072.139s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9075.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now, Mrs. Cugno, you've not been here quite as long as Mr. Scurry, but your impact has been huge over the last, is it 12?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9082.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9084.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9085.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in that time, we also got to see your family grow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9089.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9091.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because those boys, they were in elementary school way back when, and now they're in college or beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9098.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really been quite an amazing ride, Anne Marie, hasn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9106.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9109.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9110.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9111.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in that ride, one has to say, I mean, through all of the different things, of course, like with Mr. Skerry, the building of the new schools was just an amazing project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9121.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so many meetings, so many, so many meetings that we spent talking about the bigger picture and then the small picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9131.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the small picture was the color of the paint, the location of the switches,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9137.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then the bigger issues of equity, which was so, so, so important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9144.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you were part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9145.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You were a very big part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9148.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it fueled your becoming a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9152.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we were all grateful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9156.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You went on, though, to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9160.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very active on the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9162.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First by becoming the head of division two for the MASC, Massachusetts Association of School Committee, and then working your way up to an incredible year as being president of the MASC and representing Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9176.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I quite honestly believe that, sorry, most of my colleagues here don't really realize what you did during the course of that period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9186.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I was fortunate to sit on the board with Anne-Marie and be able to experience her leadership and the amount of work and travel that it took over that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9198.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Anne-Marie, maybe luckily my voice is giving out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9203.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to thank you as a friend and as a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9206.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9208.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that you will be continuing to give your heart and your love to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9293.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7197.642s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Bob, can I get you to move down just a little?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7201.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7201.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7202.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7205.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7208.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7211.447s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7224.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Erin is down at the zoning meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7230.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7232.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Sebastian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7372.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was tough to get through Medford Square because of the, you know, all the cones and the police and...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7815.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7818.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I just added that Superintendent Johnson made the following remarks the evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7830.768s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, so we addressed the four different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7834.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership, uh, director of administration and finance Christine Patterson gave the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7842.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: report and it's attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7844.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Principal Tucci verified the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7848.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily which is within its capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7858.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time there's no need to add another bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7860.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7864.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item was student concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7867.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, we talked about this at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7870.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, as part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7877.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7884.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7888.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth and nosebleeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7891.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The concern focused upon safety at away games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7897.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7906.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7914.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7920.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIA regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7926.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul Deliva, Tony Vento and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7937.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7946.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7956.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7968.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7975.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7975.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7983.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The issue raised several points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7985.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7990.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7994.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7999.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8001.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8005.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The final issue of the evening was school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8008.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8015.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8021.272s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8025.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: More will be done going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8027.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8030.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8033.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He revisited his concerns from last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8036.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8039.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8042.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was adjourned at ten oh five respectfully submitted Paulette Van der Kloot secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8175.934s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8214.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8301.613s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8301.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we do have the student who this happened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8306.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could have a follow up with the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9311.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9315.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9322.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any insight into that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9349.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9358.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9361.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and I'm just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to, um, kids going in for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9371.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I think the classroom is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9374.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Environment really is ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9377.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9430.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12099.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12100.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12102.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Honey last spring I was able to attend and I don't remember the title of it but the night of remembrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12108.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12114.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12120.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12125.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that they said was, they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12132.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, were popular, they were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12142.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12149.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: foundation here but I'm totally worried about that transition off topology and um I'm not sure I'm you just mentioned some posters how to help a friend and you know we see these uh incredible stories of you know the frat brothers who you know are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die um you know and that's that's where I'm wondering our last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12171.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12174.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12181.52s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12186.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12215.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, also, I just wondered that those two speakers who were there that night, um, have they come and spoken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12221.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others, uh, to come and talk directly to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12227.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I've wondered if, um, I haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12232.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure you have the names and they certainly expressed their willingness to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12236.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we might, um, it might be valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12581.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one in our report that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12595.917s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so striking that it is time for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12599.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a graphics arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12600.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get some posters made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12603.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12646.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12647.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Miss Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12648.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12648.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just wondered if we can also I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13609.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13611.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13612.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13660.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office on or transferred in the role was given different classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14569.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14570.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14570.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14571.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Texerra, are we or are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14598.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so um and at Medford High School say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for Well those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14640.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14654.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that working out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14662.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14683.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15113.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15114.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15122.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15131.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you give me a second to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15134.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, it has to do with the notification, um, for approval or disapproval of the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15140.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is on page four, uh, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford school committee six months prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15157.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15160.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15168.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15179.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15190.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had kids go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15191.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15193.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those things, there was no time to give six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15196.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15200.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need a sentence which say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15205.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15218.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15220.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15226.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15227.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15229.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really don't like the last minute ones that I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15235.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15240.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear you until after well deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15271.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting, Okay, so that's covered in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15280.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15285.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15291.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15293.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Other trips involving overnight travel must be must be approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15301.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15303.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Within an appropriate time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15305.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15310.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: unless someone else has a better wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15351.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everyone acceptable with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15352.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15361.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15370.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15373.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15373.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15543.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have the samples ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15544.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15550.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15553.322s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15554.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15571.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Erin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15573.632s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15574.112s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15582.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16047.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16048.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16048.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16049.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16055.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you just said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16057.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started, you know, advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this and they got everybody all excited and they might even start raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16069.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that has nothing to do with payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16072.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16086.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Payment is not the word that you want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16133.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't suggest payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16134.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone else did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16134.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16135.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16135.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that the teacher was going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16141.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if there's an overnight trip, um, uh, to the school district, I think it's a good idea to have an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16149.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16156.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16173.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I would line it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16175.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, because payment, I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16182.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just recently, the Italian come with this opportunity to go to New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16188.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16252.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me just ask the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16254.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16266.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16267.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here it said six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16311.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I think you should do three months because I think Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16318.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, if you're saying just a general blanket, then and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=211.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was called to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=221.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=225.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just added that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=226.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent Dawson made the following remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=229.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=234.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=237.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we addressed the four different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=240.823s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=245.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of Administration and Finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report and it's attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=251.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And principal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=253.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tucci verified the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=254.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, and in the afternoon, there are between 45 to 50 riders daily, which is within its capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=264.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time, there's no need to add another bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=266.79s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=270.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item was student concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=273.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about this at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=277.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=283.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=290.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=294.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=297.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The concern focused upon safety at away games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=303.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=312.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=320.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=326.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=332.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy, and Administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=343.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC Chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=352.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=360.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=374.9s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately 7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=381.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=389.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The issue raised several points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=391.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=396.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=400.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=405.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=407.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=411.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The final issue of the evening was school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=414.38s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=421.126s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=427.331s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=431.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: More will be done going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=433.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=436.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=439.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He revisited his concerns from last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=442.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=445.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=448.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was adjourned at 10.05.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=450.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Paulette Vanderkoot, Secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=578.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=581.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=620.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=707.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, but we do have the student who this happened to, and we could have a follow-up with the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1705.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: okay so we'll give you that we'll give you that report I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation yeah this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1725.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1728.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any insight into that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1758.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1764.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was only one school where there was a slight decline and I'm just want to make sure that we we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1777.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I think the classroom is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1780.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: environment really is ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1783.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it works at the Columbus, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1836.309s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4506.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4507.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Penny, last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4520.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4526.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4531.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4536.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were, you know, were popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4539.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4548.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive foundation here, but I'm totally worried about that transition off to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4560.599s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4564.301s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we see these incredible stories of the Fratt brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4569.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: who are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4573.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's where I'm wondering, our last, we're touching the kids at 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4580.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4587.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4592.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college and then all of a sudden they get there and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4622.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4627.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that they both expressed willingness to me and others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4638.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4986.4s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Betty can give you more stats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4988.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I follow up on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4989.921s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was, one jewel contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5001.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so striking that it is time for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5005.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a graphics arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5006.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get some posters made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5008.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5052.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5053.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5053.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5054.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, no, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the graphic arts department and get some posters made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6015.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6018.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6066.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6975.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6976.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6977.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mr. Texer, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7003.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay so and at Medford high school say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7046.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7059.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that working out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7068.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7088.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7514.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: uh... i'm happy to take any any questions uh... thank you bernadette so of the uh... corrections and changes that you've made i've noted that all the ones that i particularly had brought up the taking care of that of course now being said is my eyes lit on another uh...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7534.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: which I think we need to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7537.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you give me a second so I can find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7540.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7546.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is on page four, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7563.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7566.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7574.389s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7585.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7595.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7599.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those things, there was no time to give six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7602.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7606.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need a sentence which say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7610.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7625.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7631.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7633.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7634.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really don't like the last minute ones that, I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7640.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7677.392s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, there is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7683.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7685.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7690.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7692.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the second sentence need to say other, I'm just trying to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7699.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Other trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee within an appropriate time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7710.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're gonna need to leave it a little bit unclear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7715.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Unless someone else has a better wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7752.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford School Committee prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask one question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7948.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You have the samples ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7950.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7955.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it gonna hold anything up in terms of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7958.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7959.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7976.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Erin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7979.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7988.236s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8453.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a motion on the floor, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8454.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8455.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're gonna kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8461.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you just said something, you said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were gonna go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money, and that has nothing to do with payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8478.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8492.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Payment is not the word that you want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8497.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is page four, number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8538.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't suggest payment, someone else did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8540.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and I suggested that what we were doing was saying that teacher was going out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8550.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if there's an overnight trip,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8555.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8561.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying, if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8578.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's that's how I would line it out now, because payment, I think, is I think payment is arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8588.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just recently, we had the Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.14s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8591.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Come to New York opportunities to go to New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8594.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that was being funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8595.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8647.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had a new administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8657.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me just ask the committee, if we're talking about foreign trips out of country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8672.103s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 90 days, here it said six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8717.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think you should do three months, because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8725.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're saying just a general blanket, and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8767.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8768.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8772.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, Mrs. Cress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8773.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=147.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=150.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, do we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=151.453s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=220.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=230.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=234.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just added that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=235.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent Dawson made the following remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=238.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=243.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=246.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we addressed the four different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=249.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=254.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of administration and finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report, and it's attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=261.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: uh, Tucci verified the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=263.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, um, and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily with each, which is within its capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=273.196s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time there's no need to add another bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=275.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administration will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=277.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Keep the committee informed as demand increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=279.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item was student concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=282.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about this at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=286.148s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=291.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=299.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She believes that the Beverly Schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=303.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=306.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Her concern focused upon safety at away games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=312.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=321.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=329.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=335.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=341.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=351.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=361.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=371.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=383.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=398.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The issue raised several points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=400.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=405.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=409.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=414.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=416.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=420.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The final issue of the evening was school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=423.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Headmaster Perrella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=430.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=436.237s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=440.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: More will be done going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=442.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=444.965s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=448.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He revisited his concerns from last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=451.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=454.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=457.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was adjourned at 10.05.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=459.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Paulette Van der Kloot, secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=588.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Brewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=590.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing, um, and a student got hurt, why wasn't our, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.017s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=629.371s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we do have the student who this happened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could have a follow-up with the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1726.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that the Tufts Alternative School has a very low participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.761s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1737.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any insight into that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1767.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools, we see an increase between September and October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1773.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1776.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1786.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I think the classroom environment really is ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1792.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk with some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1845.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4514.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4515.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4516.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Honey, last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4523.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for those who had died of opiate-related deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4529.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4535.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4540.033s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4546.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, were popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4548.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4557.745s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4564.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: foundation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4565.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm totally worried about that transition off topology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4569.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4573.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you know, we see these incredible stories of, you know, the Fratt brothers who, you know, are drinking too much and then let their Fratt brother die.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4582.266s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, and that's where I'm wondering, our last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4586.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4589.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4596.293s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4601.115s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4631.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4636.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4644.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4647.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4997.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I follow up on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4999.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel couldn't have, whatever it was, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5010.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so striking that it is time for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5014.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a graphics arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5015.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get some posters made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5017.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5061.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5062.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5062.424s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5063.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5063.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the Graphic Arts Department and get some posters made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6024.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6026.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6027.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6075.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6075.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6983.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6985.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6985.419s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6986.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Teixeira, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7012.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and at Medford High School, say for the Portuguese students, level one and level two, would be those students who were, certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7023.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And level two, they might have been with us for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7055.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7068.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that working out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7077.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and ability of siblings to receive their, you know, sisters and brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7097.546s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7528.199s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7529.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7529.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7536.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7546.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you give me a second to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7547.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7549.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip and it is on page 4, section 3B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7560.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7572.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7575.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7583.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7594.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7604.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7608.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those things, there was no time to give six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7611.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7615.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need a sentence which say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7619.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For other field trips, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7633.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7634.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Using as timely, I mean, it depends on the time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7640.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7642.192s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7643.753s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really don't like the last minute ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7645.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7649.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7684.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: until after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7686.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7692.86s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7694.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7699.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7700.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7701.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7701.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the second sentence need to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7706.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to think, other trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7718.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: within an appropriate time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7719.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit unclear, unless someone else has a better wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7767.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're saying all school-sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7775.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7787.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7787.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7788.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7957.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask one question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7957.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have the samples ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7959.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7964.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7967.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7968.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7985.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Erin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7988.224s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7988.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7997.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8462.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8463.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8463.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8464.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8470.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you just said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8471.96s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8483.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that has nothing to do with payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8487.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8501.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Payment is not the word that you want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8547.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't suggest payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8548.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone else did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8549.988s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8550.328s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that a teacher was going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8556.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8559.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if there's an overnight trip within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8570.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this time frame, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8587.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I would line it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8589.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, because payment I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8600.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: come with this opportunity to go to New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8650.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip and the kids had already gone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8657.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had a new administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8667.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me just ask the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8669.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8681.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8681.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here it said six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8683.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We usually bring those to you pretty early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8726.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think you should do three months because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8734.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're saying just a general blanket and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months' time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8781.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, Mrs. Chris?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1148.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is this then do we need to go before the City Council to ask for this match?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1155.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And would this be part of a capital improvement plan or would this be a standalone item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1163.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1163.592s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we need to move on this relatively quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1167.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd make a motion for approval because obviously anything that we can do to improve our infrastructure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1174.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is absolutely worth doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1176.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I make a motion to approve and to send this forward to the city council for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1767.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So my question was, it's a wonderful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1773.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure we're going to be very conscientious of making sure that we have lunches for all kids, no matter what their allergies might be or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1785.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1785.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the second question I had to do had to do with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1789.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the report, it said, as discussed, signs signifying Stop and Shop's donation will be placed inside the bistro, and we will receive content, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1796.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: photos, for marketing and media relations purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1800.063s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wondered what exactly the, I could certainly see other people approaching other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1809.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: food stores for donations as well or for assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1813.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just want to make sure that because Stop and Shop has their sign that it is open to other perhaps generous givers in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1842.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you, Chris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2117.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had a question about the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2119.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this a Bus that a private bus for these no, it's not a private bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2131.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I figured for the price it had to be but I just want yes I hope you guys have a wonderful time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2135.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I was going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2135.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2144.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Cunha?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2144.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2145.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2146.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2146.722s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2147.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2147.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2149.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2498.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2499.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, this is an excellent thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2501.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, we're going to approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2503.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just want to set the record straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2505.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of timeliness of us receiving this, I believe the students left yesterday and are returning tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2522.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a motion of approval, sort of in retrospect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2526.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a great thing, and we know that it's wonderful for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2529.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm certainly glad that they're going, and I look forward to hearing from them on their return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2566.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Cunha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2572.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2573.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2573.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3997.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Roy, we knew this day would come, but it doesn't make the coming any easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4002.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've been an exceptional leader for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4005.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your commitment and dedication is simply, it can't be, it's unparalleled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4012.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've been on the school committee for a long time, so I've known and been able to work with you for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4018.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to tell you, the number of nights that I found you in your office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4023.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: night after night after night, ready to respond to any question, ready to be there, is just unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4033.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, as a school committee, we can get to pick up the phone and call the superintendent, and it didn't matter was it weekend, it didn't matter whether he was on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4043.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so some of us have talked to him when he was on vacation, and he was always there ready to answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4053.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think of your great compassion to staff members who were under duress as something that was truly, you know, always unsung.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4062.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was always below the level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4064.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But when we had a staff member who was going through some crisis, Roy was always there and compassionate for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4070.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: His dedication to our students and the whole child approach, I think on some of these things, you led the pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4076.227s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Early childhood education, the Medford Family Network, so important in our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4082.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No superintendent can be everything to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4086.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, superintendents piss people off sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4089.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4090.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you've done that, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4092.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that there have been people who've not always been enthusiastic about your leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4098.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I, for one, as someone who has sat and worked with you, who've been on many different committees and worked with you, can only say that you have been a remarkable leader for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4108.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your work ethic is just the tops, and you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4113.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Your dedication to Medford has been absolutely exemplary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4117.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=53.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=53.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=54.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=277.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary when I go in and sign the bills I see all of the The lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed and I get to see what courses they're taking what grades they've gotten they're doing great and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=295.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=665.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the only thing is of course the some of the kids are already getting to apply to college so there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=686.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: kids GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=694.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=700.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=706.067s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=724.442s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1587.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teacher's reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1606.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd the the reality was that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1612.625s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1623.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1628.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1640.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1652.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1661.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, this issue of friends and how do we, how do we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1668.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1671.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1673.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you guys are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1675.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1681.476s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1685.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1690.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there has been sometimes where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1700.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1706.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1717.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1732.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1737.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1740.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1744.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2147.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would say clearly you guys did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2628.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2631.161s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to keep something in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2634.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2643.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2646.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2649.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've gone to many different events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2651.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We celebrate the McGlynn and we celebrate the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2655.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: we it is wrong to say that we didn't know that with 60% okay that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight but we know that and we may have to look about that is there a perception because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2671.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2683.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those students are great students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2686.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2689.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2694.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2700.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep this into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2704.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2711.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2721.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because all of a sudden we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2727.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, nobody called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2730.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2737.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2739.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2747.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's that how do we block up then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2749.729s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2756.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what is I've heard over and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2759.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2770.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to keep it in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2772.827s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2776.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the teachers coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2779.235s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem we're trying to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4259.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4264.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4265.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4267.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll go along with the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4268.663s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4270.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open creative playgrounds for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4277.511s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4282.535s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the creative space opportunity, which is a decidedly different area than a conventional playground, would be a very interesting thing to pursue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4295.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5005.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop who is selling 02155 gear and because they're going to plan, they're planning a trip to Europe and I just really want to support their efforts and it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5020.507s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I had brought mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5021.268s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I meant to when I brought it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5022.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The bracelet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5024.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5221.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips, and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5823.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5825.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5825.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5826.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2012,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5837.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5841.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're going in the wrong direction, but maybe that's a better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5845.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5847.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5866.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'd like to trace it too because that's a concern if a kid plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5883.243s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's also across the board, not just sport by sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5948.669s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5950.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6347.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderkle, did that happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6351.664s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once, was it a one-time incident, or was it, it was when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6358.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6358.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6361.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They did not realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6362.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They didn't realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6378.874s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we should be posting it, and now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6380.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6381.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=0.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Scurry will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=12.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=13.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=13.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=14.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=237.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=250.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=255.785s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I've noticed there were a lot that came in, probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent, and that's the line item you're seeing, but I have looked at every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=620.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=620.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=621.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the only thing is, of course, some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college, so there is a timeliness issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=628.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, too, have a different recollection than what's here, because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=642.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: kids' GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=650.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=656.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=661.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=680.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1541.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teacher's reaction was that he felt demonized and less so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1549.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I felt very, very sad because that was certainly, I don't think, our intention as school committee members or maybe even the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1563.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reality was that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1567.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1577.633s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1583.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1595.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1607.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to keep class sizes reasonable, and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits, nor would we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1616.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, this issue of friends, and how do we, how do we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1622.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1626.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1628.119s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you guys are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1629.68s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1635.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1639.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1645.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there has been sometimes where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1654.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1661.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1671.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1687.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1691.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1694.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1698.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2098.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd say clearly you guys did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2580.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2582.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to keep something in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2586.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2595.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2598.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2601.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've gone to many different events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2603.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2607.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is wrong to say that we didn't know that with 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2620.241s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a perception because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2622.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2635.65s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those students are great students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2637.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2641.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2646.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2652.281s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep this into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2655.825s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2662.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2673.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because all of a sudden we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2679.678s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2680.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2681.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2689.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2691.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2699.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's that how do we block up then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2701.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2707.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I've heard over and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2711.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2720.973s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, I need to keep it in perspective, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2724.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2728.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the teachers coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2730.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I need you to remember where this came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2733.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's the problem we were trying to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4198.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4198.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4199.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just really wanted to congratulate you on working so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4203.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember so many times seeing you gathering signatures to make sure that this would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4209.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4214.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4214.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4217.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll go along with the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4218.429s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4220.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open, creative playgrounds for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4227.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4232.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the creative space opportunity, which is decidedly different area than a conventional playground would be a very interesting thing to pursue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4245.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4953.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop, who is selling 02155 gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4958.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because they're going to plan, they are planning a trip to Europe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4962.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just really want to support their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4966.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4967.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I had brought mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4968.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I meant to, and I forgot it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4969.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The bracelet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4971.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4972.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The hat, shirts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5168.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips, and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5772.519s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5772.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5774.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2014-15 school year, there were 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5785.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5788.567s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're going in the wrong direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5790.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe that's a better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5794.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5814.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'd like to trace it, too, because that's a concern if the kid has, you know, plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse and, you know, we're making, it's also across the board, not just sport by sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5895.977s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5898.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6294.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: VanderKloof, did that happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6298.892s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once, was it a one time incident, or was it, it was when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6304.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6305.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6305.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6308.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They did not realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6309.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They didn't realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6326.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we should be posting it, and now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=17.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=240.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=253.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=259.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=628.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the only thing is of course the the some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college So there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=649.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: kids GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=657.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=663.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=669.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=687.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1550.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teachers reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1569.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd the the reality was that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1575.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1586.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1591.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1604.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1615.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1625.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this issue of friends and how do we, how do we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1631.563s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1635.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1636.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you guys are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1638.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1644.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1648.591s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1653.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that there has been some times where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1663.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1670.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1680.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1695.772s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1700.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1703.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1707.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down, and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2110.384s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd say clearly you guys did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2591.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2594.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to keep something in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2597.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2607.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2610.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2612.953s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've gone to many different events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2615.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2619.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is wrong to say that we didn't know that 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2631.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a perception because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2634.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2647.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Those students are great students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2649.296s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2652.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2657.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2663.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep this into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2667.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2674.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2684.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because all of a sudden, we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.149s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2693.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2701.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2702.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2710.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's that how do we block up then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2712.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2719.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what is I've heard over and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2722.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2732.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just I need to keep it in perspective Okay, I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2739.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the teachers coming forward I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4209.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember so many times seeing you gathering signatures to make sure that this would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4223.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4227.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4228.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4230.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll go along with the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4231.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4233.929s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open creative playgrounds for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4240.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4245.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the creative space opportunity, which is decidedly different area than a conventional playground would be a very interesting thing to pursue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4258.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4968.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop who is selling 02155 gear and because they're going to plan, they are planning a trip to Europe and I just really want to support their efforts and it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4983.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I had brought mine, I meant to when I brought it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4985.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The bracelet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4987.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5184.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5787.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5788.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5788.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5789.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2012,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5800.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5804.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're going in the wrong direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5806.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe that's a better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5809.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5810.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5829.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'd like to trace it too because that's a concern if a kid plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5846.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's also across the board, not just sport by sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5911.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5913.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6309.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6310.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6310.504s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: VanderKloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6312.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did that happen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6314.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Once, was it a one time incident?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6317.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or was it, it was when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6321.132s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6321.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6324.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They did not realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6325.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They didn't realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6341.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we should be posting it, and now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=13.684s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=14.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Scurry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=36.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=38.066s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=38.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=39.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member, but our student representative, Sebastian Tringali, with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=898.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=908.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=909.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=912.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent wouldn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=914.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=915.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=929.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But they were in North Andover last year, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1402.137s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1442.433s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1447.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1969.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I move that the party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1980.198s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1993.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1993.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2445.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Ajero and Mr. Wolfe to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2462.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3037.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3038.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3039.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3051.689s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were lots of discrepancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3054.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that's a very timely thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3056.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3057.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was the information that you received so far this year more accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3084.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3088.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3090.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question has to do with the participation rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3094.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3114.012s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we know who took the test and who didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3115.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3116.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3428.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3448.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Traditionally it goes to the curriculum committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3709.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3711.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3714.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3940.637s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's such a great addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3942.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also, though, just need to take a moment to thank my colleague, Anne Marie Cuno, who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3952.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been a long time of great successes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3974.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3975.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you do a great job, Anthony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3976.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5178.649s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5187.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5193.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it was more than that, because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5203.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5223.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5235.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We knew that... No, not in terms of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5316.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Like, I see that it says that we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5324.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5327.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5382.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5634.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm racist So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5720.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But not to this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6138.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we did it, it was very unpopular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6142.509s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6146.492s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6166.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just haven't heard that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6172.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6177.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, really positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6179.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mia, you nearly took my breath away when you said, why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6184.28s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that might be something we're going to talk about, but we're going to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6187.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6194.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very difficult thing as a school committee member, because we are naturally people who want to please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6200.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're going to not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6207.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6216.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how are we making sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6218.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6222.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a... because we were so concerned at the time of building them that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6242.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6249.503s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6256.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6259.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6545.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6546.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6546.946s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6552.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The teacher is extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6553.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6558.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by- She had a hundred last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6564.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6565.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she told us to do it at the other school as well, or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6579.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because to just say, okay, every student, if I understand the student that you're talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6586.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're going to have 25 calls of kids who hear this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6597.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6749.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6750.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had one more question, a little bit back to earlier in your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6754.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned to us the teacher changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6757.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm wondering if that's because are the teachers willing to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6764.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to see grievances at some point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6768.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wondered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6881.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand, I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6887.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6931.725s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6933.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7638.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we didn't spend enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7640.527s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=39.985s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member but our student representative Sebastian Tringali with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=899.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=910.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=913.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent wouldn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=915.053s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=916.634s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=930.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But they were in North Andover last year, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1396.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1398.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1403.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1443.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1445.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1446.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: they would be living in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1448.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1973.276s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2446.03s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Adgero and Mr. Wolf to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2463.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3039.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3040.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3052.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were lots of discrepancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3055.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that's a very timely thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3085.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3089.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3091.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3091.581s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question has to do with the participation rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3094.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3114.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, but we know who took the test and who didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3116.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3117.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3428.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3449.425s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Traditionally, it goes to the curriculum committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3712.327s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3714.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3939.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3941.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's such a great addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3943.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also though just need to take a moment to thank my colleague Ann Marie Cuno who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3953.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been a long time of great successes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3976.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you do a great job, Anthony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3977.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3979.888s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5177.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5178.092s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5179.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5188.958s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy, but it was more than that because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5204.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5222.817s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this was clearly a great concern to the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5228.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps you could address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5236.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We knew that- No, not in terms of that, Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5238.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's being done now to make sure those students are- Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5317.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, like I see that it says, you know, we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5325.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5328.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5383.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5637.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5721.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But not to this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6139.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we did it, it was very unpopular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6143.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6147.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6153.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6167.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just haven't heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6171.397s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that level, the ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6178.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, really positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6180.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mia, you nearly took my breath away when you said, why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6185.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that might be something we're gonna talk about, but we're gonna make a lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice in schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6195.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very difficult thing as a school committee member, because we are naturally people who want to please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6201.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're gonna not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6208.468s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6217.654s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how are we making sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6218.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6223.557s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a, because we were so concerned at the time of building them, that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in, and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6242.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6250.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6257.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6260.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6281.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to have one school which has 300 kids in one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6546.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6547.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6547.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandiver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6547.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6553.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The teacher is extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6554.875s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6559.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by- She had a hundred last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6565.603s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6566.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she tells us to do it at the other school as well, or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6579.95s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because to just say, okay, every student,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6584.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand about the student that you're talking about, but frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're gonna have 25 calls of kids who hear this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6598.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6751.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had one more question a little bit back to earlier in your report you mentioned to us the teacher changes and I'm wondering if that's because are where the teachers willing to do that or where are they are we going to see grievances at some point I just wondered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6882.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6883.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6888.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6895.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6933.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6933.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=272.499s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member but our student representative Sebastian Tringali with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1132.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1142.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1145.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent wouldn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1147.574s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there would be not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1149.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1163.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But they were in North Andover last year, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1629.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1635.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1675.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1681.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2203.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I move that the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3271.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3272.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The first question is, I remember that last year there were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3277.502s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3285.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There were lots of discrepancies, and I know that's a very timely thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3290.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was the information that you received so far this year more accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3318.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3322.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3324.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question has to do with the participation rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3327.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3331.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The initial look at it suggests that we are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3335.731s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, we should have some idea, shouldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3347.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we know who took the test and who didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3349.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3350.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3661.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3682.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Traditionally, it goes to the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4210.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4212.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4213.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5410.652s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5410.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5412.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5421.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy, but it was more than that because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5437.008s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5455.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And this was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5469.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, not in terms of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5471.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What's being done now to make sure those students are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5550.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that it says we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5558.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5561.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5615.764s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5863.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's know unless you make the request you're going to So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5954.195s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But not to this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6371.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, when we did it, it was very unpopular and there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6380.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6385.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6400.375s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just haven't heard that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6405.978s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6411.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6412.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: positive and you know Mia you nearly took my breath away when you said why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that well that might be something we're gonna talk about but we're gonna make a lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice in schools it's a very difficult thing as a school committee member because we are naturally people who want to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6434.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're gonna not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6441.254s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6450.443s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how are we making sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6451.744s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6456.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a, because we were so concerned at the time of building them, that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in, and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6475.704s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6483.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6489.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6493.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6513.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to have one school which has 300 kids in one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6779.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6780.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6786.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The teacher is extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6787.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6792.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6798.401s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6798.881s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she's also to do it at the other school as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6806.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular because to just say, okay, every student, if you know, I understand the student that you're talking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6820.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But, frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're going to have 25 calls of kids who hear this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6831.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6984.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had one more question a little bit back to earlier in your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6988.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned to us the teacher changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6990.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm wondering if that's because, were the teachers willing to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6998.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to see grievances at some point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7001.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wondered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7115.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand, I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7120.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7128.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7165.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=19.834s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=944.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a saying which says that the devil is in the details and I sort of feel like that's part of what our discussion about the vocational school and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=955.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the changes we had this summer, because while I'm having a feeling that perhaps the administration, it was all perfectly clear to them, all of these details, from the school committee perspective, as I had expressed to the superintendent, once I learned of some of the changes, was not clear at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=976.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For example, I was not clear that all of a sudden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=980.902s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: guidance Councilor would no longer sit in that particular office over on their side, or that the kids would not have an assistant principal with them in the course of where those SHOP programs are held.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=996.578s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe there's a good rationale behind a lot of the different changes, but quite honestly, I don't understand all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1003.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think, I mean, as every, my colleagues have said, it's important for us to understand it in order to embrace them or to say, hey, wait a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1011.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: does that really need to be and how do we maintain that identity for the vocational program, which I'll say the vocational program, because it's important that we have that identity held strong so that in the future, not only are they Mighty Mustangs, but they're members of the vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1031.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's possible to be both in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1035.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I look forward to the follow-up on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1038.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly have a lot of questions as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1040.89s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I say that, I don't want to take away from the work that was done by so many in being able to bring some of the walls down, because there was a lot of work, and there are a lot of advantages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1052.901s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we want to go forward being able to take advantage of all those positive things, but also really looking back and saying, wait a second, is that what we thought, and how does that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1329.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2131.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then if we could take up that issue again about the Andrews-McGlynn when we're under enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2524.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say thank you to both people and Mrs. Lasky for organizing the new teacher induction and the administrative meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2534.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had the opportunity to come up to the high school and say hello to the new teachers and of course they all look so young.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3073.858s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, my question, I heard something about there will be an action report, and I think that's in relation to the discrepancy of enrollment between the Andrews and McGlynn, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3085.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3086.604s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and when are we to expect that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3093.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3094.417s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the biggest concern I have right at the moment, I think that there's a long term and a short term, but clearly we heard from some parents of students who did not get their first choice school and were very upset about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3110.023s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to make sure that we follow those kids and make sure that their acclimation to the new school is in fact going well and they're not being adversely impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3148.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, I read my packet thoroughly and I don't, did you just give us an action report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3157.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, maybe it's in someone's, but it's not in mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3160.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have the Yoki, I have the purple paper, I have the executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3165.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do not have that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3167.386s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No wonder, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3169.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3170.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I still don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3171.308s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So now I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3193.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe perhaps we could put it on the agenda for follow-up at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3204.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we have questions about it, I'd like to put it on the agenda, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3708.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: John, in your report, you attached information from an inspection from the plaster in this auditorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3715.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's difficult for us to see because the lights are in our eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3719.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noted that you said that we made ceiling repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3722.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So are the ceiling repairs consistent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3724.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the recommendations in the report, and did we have our guys do that, or did we have professionals come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3738.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't tell anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3739.808s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right above us, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3747.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So all of those were taken care of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3764.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess the key part of that is besides the repair work, it sounded like any issues that allowed water in that might have caused this are taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5567.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5569.968s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would just like to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5571.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether, and this obviously is totally up to you, because you're certainly free to make any statement you want to us, whether you want to make a public statement or you want to talk to our Attorney General directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5582.373s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to put that out as to whether this is an issue you want aired publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5591.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6100.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6105.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Greenspan, does the school committee have the right to direct the superintendent to enroll the students or would that be in contempt of court?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6124.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't seen the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6128.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, this is a really difficult issue for us because I think that we have great sympathy and we certainly want to get the kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6135.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Frankly, wherever they're going to school, we want those kids to be enrolled in school and resume their normal education path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6142.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a one school committee member, I feel great sympathy, but I don't think this is in my purview as much as I might want it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6656.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: May I follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6658.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6659.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't really... My feeling, too, is that I understand you're saying we may not have the standing, but if we don't at least try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6666.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, it's in the best interest of the students, of the children, that we make the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6674.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, I would at least want to petition them, even if it's for a temporary placement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6679.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, could we ask you to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7789.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7789.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7791.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7792.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perillo, I have to say the only thing which is just, well, I have two different things that's just gnawing at me, and I'll vote to go along with this, but the other day I overheard a conversation between two parents, and one of them said, my son has already called or texted me six times, and it was only 10.30 in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7812.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, I wish they wouldn't allow this, because it was clearly, where is that separation between child and parent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7820.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I see that as a growing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7822.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: concern, we talk about helicopter parents, we talk about, you know, kids, they're just, the advent of this ease in 24-7 technology has also meant for some kids not being as, gaining their independence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7839.31s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7840.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at my workplace where I supervise high school students, I know that there's been a real issue where it's been very difficult to say, nope, you can't use those cell phones when you're, oh yeah, pushing a patient or taking them, you know, and having to make strict lines, especially because there's other than employees walking through the halls on their cell phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7863.566s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, when you're in the kind of environment where I work, we need to impress upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7870.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: our students what's appropriate and they're just so used to having ready access that when that cell phone buzzes, they're thinking they can be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7939.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, that shouldn't be the whole focus of your day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7943.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7944.778s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8098.317s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perla, while you're here, I'm just going to take this opportunity to mention that the school committee has been without a student representative for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8106.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Over the course of years, occasionally we've had some students that we've done better or worse, but now for the last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8113.81s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: last two years or more, we haven't had anybody, and certainly nobody consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8119.251s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's valuable when we get to a question like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8122.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is when, while you've done an excellent job defending your position and explaining to us the rationale, which I certainly appreciate, but this is so much a question when we should have our student representatives present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8138.315s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm wondering if we could ask you to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8141.863s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: explain to the students what the role is, explain that this is an opportunity for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8146.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had some great, you know, vocal people in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8151.187s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We like hearing from the kids, and I'm wondering if you could help arrange that so that we could expect to have students on a regular basis attend our meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8164.819s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8166.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure there are a lot of people who will force him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8169.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll be up to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8182.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you do need us to come forward, and as Mr. Skerry said, to come recruit kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8187.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're always welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8188.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there's always been a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8189.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There always is a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8191.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've been to many other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10831.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a couple of first nuts and bolts questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10835.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You listed in your report Curtis liabilities and one of them was notification of rights and suggested that this could be easily resolved by adding a message to the school brains login screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10847.545s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Has that been done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10856.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very easy to... Then it would just seem that we should try and take these liabilities off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10861.516s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Another one was the current ad hoc method of assigning user security roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10865.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is unsustainable and may expose sensitive information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10871.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would think that that would be another one that we would need to spend some time on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10877.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The data storage, I understand, being an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10881.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are kind of nuts and bolts issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10883.075s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since you've identified them, I'd like to try and resolve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10886.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The bigger issue that is also brought up in this report is the whole GPA system and the weighting of courses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10893.76s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's a much larger conversation than certainly any of us have the wherewithal tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10900.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that should probably happen within the course of meetings and probably in the curriculum subcommittee, perhaps, if my colleagues thought so as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10911.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that there's a lot of input we need to get and a lot of information for all of those questions which were presented to us, really saying is that the best possible way to go in the future to determine student achievement and how we emphasize that, how we tell schools, colleges, when kids are applying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10933.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what sort of student this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10935.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It also goes on and says, you know, how do we give out awards and is it based on GPA or is it based on other stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10941.734s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a lot of information in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10944.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And something that I would suggest that we send to the curriculum subcommittee, which is my subcommittee, and ponder and work on that over some period of time this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11372.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have a question that I'd like to throw out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11395.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Since we're talking about next week's meeting, I have to tell you as one committee member, this has not been an ideal setup for me tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11405.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very difficult to feel like I'm having a conversation with my fellow school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11410.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The lights are in our eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11412.694s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We only sort of see the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11415.658s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure whether the television was capturing the speakers who came before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11422.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11423.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11427.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11429.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11430.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only problem is that as a body who is interacting with my colleagues, frankly, it's very disconcerting to be trying to have a discussion in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=11441.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like some thought put into this next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=552.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=2647.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations, Phaedra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=2649.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that it said that the students' work would be posted on our website with their parents' permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=2656.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, when it was posted last year, I read every one, and it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=2661.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really hope that, parents, you give permission so that we can read your students' work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3598.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, as a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3603.628s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was, but I specifically looked at it and checked it because I, too, was like the way that it was categorized seemed funny, but it made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3670.305s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On page what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3712.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3716.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3998.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4004.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one, we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4008.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: broadcasts on TV publicly, so I just want to read it for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4012.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Meeting with Attorney General clarified the B-1, B-2 enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4021.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, our schools do not have to remove any existing B-1, B-2 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4026.159s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4033.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, as a question on...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4036.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: see that there was discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4043.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those appointments yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4065.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We did a motion, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6079.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6085.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6092.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6132.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6177.412s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whenever we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Ann Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6185.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, just want to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6229.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just noticed that in the form, it says that the summer fund program runs 7.30 PM to 4.30 PM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6236.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It just needs to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6467.807s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And by splitting the families between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're moving in that direction, that could create some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6478.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's the place that I'm most concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6481.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6492.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And most importantly is the information to the families so we're aware of any, you know, real problems ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2102.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations, Pedro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2104.337s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that it said that the students' work would be posted on our website with their parents' permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2111.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, when it was posted last year, I read every one, and it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2116.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really hope that parents should get permission so that we can read your students' work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2121.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for mentioning that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3051.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3052.004s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel, point of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3053.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3053.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3058.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you, because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3061.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I specifically looked at it and checked it, because I, too, was like, the way that it was categorized seemed funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3068.549s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But once I saw what it was, it made perfect sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3125.489s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On page what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3452.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3452.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3454.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3459.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was broadcast on TV publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3464.795s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to read it for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3467.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Meeting with Attorney General clarified the B1, B2 enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3472.182s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Schools are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3476.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, our schools do not have to remove any existing B1, B2 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3481.348s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3489.133s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, as a question, I see that there was a discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent, and I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3508.369s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4351.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4351.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4352.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does the human geography course, will it be in place of one of the other AP courses or it's addition to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5534.784s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5541.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: For students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5548.788s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5588.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5588.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5632.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Whenever we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Anne Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5640.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just want to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5914.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5915.381s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Miss Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5917.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think my biggest concern is sometimes older students are in charge of looking after younger siblings and by splitting the families, uh, between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5928.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: moving in that direction, that could create some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5933.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's the place that I'm most concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5937.693s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5947.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And most importantly is the information to the families, so we're aware of any real problems ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=756.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Scudino?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=757.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=967.674s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's like a dream come true for our Medford students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=973.696s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, we can't express our appreciation to Jim and Thelma Connors, but we certainly owe them a huge debt of thanks for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=984.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I appreciate all the people who are working on this to make sure that it is administered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=989.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: correctly and that our students will benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=991.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do hope that we receive a list of all the students who received them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1538.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just, it's always nice to see the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1541.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's particularly nice to see that we've got a student accepted into Yale this year, because that's a very difficult school to have an acceptance, so I was particularly happy to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1551.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that a Medford student had made it to Yale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1553.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think it's been a while since that's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2064.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony, that I know Mrs. Kreatz and myself were able to attend Dr. Ruth Pote's talk, which was just exceptional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2073.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody in the audience who, and I've talked to people since, have said it was one of the best things that they've attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2079.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that at some point we might be able to bring her back again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2082.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She truly was... It was a wonderful event and I'm so glad that I was able to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2521.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2524.054s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: an opportunity to review this report in detail and I did look at all of the findings and although there was much that I didn't understand as a novice in this area, there were other parts that just make common sense as they were talking about, you know, areas where all of a sudden it would get too crowded, if you would, and somehow or another it just seemed one of the most comprehensive and clearly it's something we need to move ahead on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2551.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the next appropriate step to have a committee of the whole to review this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2577.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, I'm comfortable with just authorizing the administration to move ahead if my colleagues are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4201.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, this is actually a question for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4204.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier this year, we started out by putting together items that we thought were part of a capital improvement plan, including the edging along at the middle school complex, all of that edging along the roads that were sidewalk, which were a concern, and I think also the playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4225.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I haven't, we're really sort of talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4228.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: individual projects again and not the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4232.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are we on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4262.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And would a project like, I mean, again, we've sort of had ongoing concerns, ultimately, about the play surfaces and the playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4269.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that much work was done, and there were patches and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4273.445s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's still out there as a project, which we need to take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4281.229s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4283.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Pretty soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4284.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5092.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5093.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5094.539s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5097.02s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You touched on possible federal impacts, and of course that picture is not clear to us at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5102.802s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, today the National School Boards Association did send out an alert because of the concern about the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the impact on Medicaid funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5119.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for public school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5121.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If passed at this point, it would limit Medicaid funding and it says the impact, the ability of students with disabilities and students in poverty to receive critical necessary health services in public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5136.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The legislation will require schools to compete for limited Medicaid funding and result in the institution of arbitrary caps and how much Medicaid reimbursements are made to public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5146.362s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, this would be another area where I know that money comes back to the city, but it's another place where we would find a loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5159.575s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They urge us to call our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5162.396s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: House of Representative people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5164.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, we understand where they already sit in our state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5170.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did want to bring it to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=92.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3509.294s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And would a project like, I mean, again, we've, we've sort of had ongoing concerns ultimately about the play surfaces and the playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3516.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that much work was done and there were patches and whatever, but you know, it's still out there as a project, which we, we need to take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3530.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3532.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4340.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4340.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4341.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4344.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You touched on possible federal impacts, and of course that picture is not clear to us at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4349.88s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, today the National School Boards Association did send out an alert because of the concern about the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the impact on Medicaid funding for public school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4368.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If passed at this point, it would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4373.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: limit Medicaid funding and it says the impact the ability of students with disabilities and students in poverty to receive critical necessary health services in public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4383.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The legislation will require schools to compete for limited Medicaid funding and result in the institution of arbitrary caps and how much Medicaid reimbursements are made to public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4393.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again this would be another area where I know that money comes back to the city but it's another place where we would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4402.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: find a loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4404.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It impacts the pie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4406.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They urge us to call our House of Representatives people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4411.387s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, we understand where they already sit in our state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4417.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did want to bring it to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1030.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1030.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1031.193s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1031.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1035.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I reflect on this, I think exactly what Kathy picked up was the thing that most concerns me, that 32 out of 39 kids reported that they had been in a car where they knew that someone had been drinking or using drugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1047.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just about two months, within the last two to three months, a young stonem teenager lost her life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1053.886s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And prior, I know many of the kids who were friends or in her class, and sadly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1060.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to that, and fortunately, there were other students in the car who had gotten out before she had her tragic accident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1068.479s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that that's the piece here, we're talking about ninth graders, that we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1073.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By the junior and senior prom, it's really too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1076.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the piece that we really need to target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1102.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Toni.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1582.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that it's important that we note that the different sorts of things that the money is being spent on, including<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1590.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: five foot wide concrete sidewalk and granite curbs, including ramps, pavement mill and overlay, signs and striping, landscaping, drainage, utility improvements, school zone, flasher, traffic control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1603.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And these are the sorts of needed improvements that will make our city safer for walking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1609.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is really fantastic, and thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1877.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1878.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was trying to think that perhaps it would have been nice to have our principals of the middle schools come forward so that we could approve their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1889.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: field trips rather than keeping them to the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1917.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1919.344s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1919.845s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1920.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the Andrews told us the cost of the trip, but I didn't see it in the McGlynn report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1929.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And yours, the students go just overnight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1933.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for the Andrews, it's two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1935.976s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what time do they leave in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1941.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1941.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then they return?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1946.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1946.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just an interesting difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1973.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1974.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I think it'll be interesting when you compare notes after the trips to see how it worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1979.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how many students do you have participating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1983.994s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1984.295s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1986.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't make sense to combine them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1991.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously not this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2014.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2014.467s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not meaning this year at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2015.908s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just, and I think that there were pros and cons, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2020.18s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2072.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2072.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2073.459s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2943.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2944.524s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have the list of where they are in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2946.907s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just sort of curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2947.847s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there one in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2949.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2949.829s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right in the front lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2950.93s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2951.671s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just in case, because sometimes passions get pretty heated here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5394.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that I really love that after the AP exams, the students are going to go down to Kids' Corner and teach them some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5401.923s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: some words and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5403.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that was a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6063.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6065.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6067.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could I just ask, what was the date of the pathways?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6082.329s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6082.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's so many things that night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6085.171s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that one didn't get on our list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6086.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6087.793s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6089.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess one other comment, I just wanted to, I really like that there's been so much interaction between our students and Tufts and many of the other MIT and whatever so that our students are seeing real world potential jobs in mathematics and what people do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6107.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that clearly your report listed so many of them and I think that's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6111.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6278.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6279.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did wonder, when we were given the school council reports, my colleague earlier asked about the PTO representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6287.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if we might combine those two, because often the school council reports reflect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6293.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6305.285s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6305.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes we hear about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1849.705s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was trying to think that perhaps it would have been nice to have our principals of the middle schools come forward so that we could approve their field trips rather than keeping them to the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1888.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1890.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1890.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1891.246s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the Andrews told us the cost of the trip, but I didn't see it in the McGlynn report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1899.851s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and yours, the students go just overnight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1904.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And for the Andrews, it's two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1906.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So what time do they leave in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1912.117s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and then they return?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1917.398s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1917.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just an interesting difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1944.162s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1945.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I think it'll be interesting when you compare notes after the trips to see how it worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1950.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how many students do you have participating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1954.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1955.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1957.541s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1958.643s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't make sense to combine them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1961.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously not this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1984.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1985.303s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not meaning this year at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1986.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just, and I think that there were pros and cons, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1991.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2043.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2044.299s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks very much Mr. Skerry<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2914.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2915.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have the list of where they are in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2917.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just sort of curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2923.065s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cause sometimes, you know, passions get pretty heated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5365.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that I really love that after the AP exams, the students are going to go down to Kid's Corner and teach them some words and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=5373.926s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that was a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6060.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess one other comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6061.871s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I really like that there's been so much interaction between our students and Tufts and many of the other MIT and whatever, so that our students are seeing real world<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6078.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that clearly your report listed so many of them, and I think that's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6250.454s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did wonder, uh, when we were given the school council reports, my colleague earlier asked about, uh, the PTO representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6258.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if we might, um, combine those two because often the school council reports reflect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=302.402s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Cugno called upon the superintendent to begin the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=306.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent reiterated the importance of understanding the difference between capital planning projects and general repair and maintenance issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=314.551s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Capital planning is usually a multi-year group of projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=317.837s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Such projects generally require a mix of bonding, grants, and revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=335.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Capital projects often take multiple years to get approval from the funding agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=340.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Additionally, there are many non-school projects that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=343.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There must be a balance between city and school priorities as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=382.239s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The three grants are the Massachusetts Life Sciences Grant for $98,516, which will support the development of our robotics and engineering programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=399.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We will match this funding with both in-kind assistance from our partners in industry and labor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=404.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, we will use funding that is in the reserve contingency from the science labs project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=409.005s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This will require council approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=410.987s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Third is regional services grant for $200,000 to expand our shops to accommodate enrollment increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=418.312s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The focus of this grant will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=420.493s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on our electrical program and related areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=422.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It will facilitate the inclusion with students from Everett who will pay a tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=428.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Currently, we have 25 Everett students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=434.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are also recapturing tuitions from Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=437.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The grants will be supplemented by in-kind work by the laborers and Wynn, as well as the other industry partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=443.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The development of our shop spaces will also enable us to serve adult learners and to maximize the use of our facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=450.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The laborers will also help increase handicap accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=457.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The high school roof needs some small repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=460.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that could be accomplished for about $25,000 to $30,000 this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=464.277s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We would expect to consider roof replacement beginning with 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=467.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This would be done in sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=486.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Mia Mastone asked how we could find funding for this type of repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=491.302s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also why we are not finding money for building appearance projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=496.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: he would have had to shut down a building if the repairs were not made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=500.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is not uncommon to divert funding for emergency repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=504.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: He also reiterated his plan to add additional funds to the operational budget next year for general repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=511.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Erinda Benedetto asked that the hanging wires in the conference room be removed from sight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=516.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Scurry urged more cosmetic work be done, and members Cugno and Van der Kloot recognized the need to do more with appearance, but supported the priority of emergency repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=527.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=531.242s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent referenced the report from Mr. McLaughlin regarding the need to repair air conditioning compressors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=536.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While the schools are functional, there could be better efficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=540.667s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's also an attached listing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=564.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As we move forward, technology is central to our educational and operational programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=569.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Testing, state, federal funding, reporting, and instruction are more and more dependent on a robust and reliable technology, sorry, infrastructure and tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=580.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are eligible for substantial funding from the e-rate program under Tier 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1078.584s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing that I would like to do is I would like to put forth a resolution that the Medford Public Schools pay for our students to attend the competition in North Carolina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1090.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if Mr. Eisner is willing, we certainly would certainly appreciate his accompanying our team in doing whatever we can do, because I am so, so proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1587.361s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1592.165s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She was a remarkable woman, both in her life and also as she was approaching the end of her life, and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1601.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is very fitting, and I'm thankful to her husband, Thomas, for making this a lasting tribute to her on our school grounds, which she loves so dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1655.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1655.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1836.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly, I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1842.944s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1847.548s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1859.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1884.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I guess I'm looking at it a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1886.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I'm a parent thinking about making plans,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1890.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1896.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1906.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1913.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1918.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's an expectation thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1921.676s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What do others think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.097s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1949.517s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we just did some further clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1951.798s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2068.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2072.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, many families preferred it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2074.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and certainly the teachers did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2076.031s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2080.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: too far into June because we were getting more snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2083.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We went through a period of years where we're getting a lot of snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2086.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so with the cooperation of the teachers union, we then moved it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2091.937s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it preferable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2092.918s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2094.259s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It depends on who you talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2095.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's because of, I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2101.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2108.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3057.803s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3059.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3093.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4230.882s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4231.062s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Klooten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4232.403s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure what you said in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4234.585s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a freshman can't take art and band together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4291.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4297.016s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if they wanted to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4298.747s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4303.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4314.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the pro of this is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4316.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the advantage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4326.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4328.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4336.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's pros and cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4366.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, will they get graded in that CTE exploration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4374.743s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5075.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5079.862s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you're saying you're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5082.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5086.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And at that point, there was no school nurse present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5088.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5095.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5125.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5130.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=186.884s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: projects for the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=189.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vice Chair Cuno called upon the superintendent to begin the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=193.609s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent reiterated the importance of understanding the difference between capital planning projects and general repair and maintenance issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=201.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Capital planning is usually a multi-year group of projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=204.757s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Such projects generally require a mix of bonding, grants, and revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1474.314s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1479.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She was a remarkable woman, both in her life,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1481.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and also as she was approaching the end of her life and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1542.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1720.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1723.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Beverly, I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1729.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1734.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1745.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1771.576s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I guess I'm looking at it a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1773.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I'm a parent thinking about making plans, if you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1783.323s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1793.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back to two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1805.615s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, I think it's an expectation thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1808.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What do others think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1836.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1836.458s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If we just did some further clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1838.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1955.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1959.188s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, many families preferred it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1961.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And certainly the teachers did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1962.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1967.449s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: too far into June because we were getting more snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1970.151s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We went through a period of years where we were getting a lot of snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1973.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, with the cooperation of the Teachers Union, we then moved it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1978.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it preferable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1979.859s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1981.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It depends on who you talk to, but it's because of — I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1988.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1995.752s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2944.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2946.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was also, if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2980.27s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4117.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4118.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4119.342s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure what you said in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4121.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So a freshman can't take art and band together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4178.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4184.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4185.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4190.245s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4201.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the pro of this is, I mean, the advantage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4213.061s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4213.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just, you know, the opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4223.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's pros and cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4255.001s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Will they get graded in that CTE exploration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4261.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4962.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4966.815s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you're saying you're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4969.136s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools, and at that point, there was no school nurse present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4975.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4982.619s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5012.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5017.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=350.55s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I would urge the superintendent as he considers this not to choose the third option all students proportionately share in the cost which was what was originally presented to us last week in reference to when the band trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=367.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To me it just felt like that by doing it that way it could make students feel like their trip was more expensive because one of their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=376.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: fellow students needed a nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=379.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Instead I think that it would be much better for either us for us to decide that on whatever field trip there was a uniform every student puts 25 bucks into the kitty or whatever I mean just so that it was a uniform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=393.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: a cost to help offset the district's cost because option number one is the school system pays for the cost outright and that of course would be my choice but I'm also understanding that it is there's an expense and it could so by having some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=412.948s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: amount of money, but it would be uniform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=414.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it wouldn't be for just one field trip or the other would be across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=418.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Every time there's a field trip, every student would have as part of the cost, a small charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=440.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the idea of having the kitty, if you would, would be so that money would be thrown into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=447.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to help offset the costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=450.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it would be proportionate to, let's say it's a, if a, you know, $5 a day or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=456.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just speaking off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=458.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if it was a five-day field trip to Florida, the kids might put in 25 bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=488.998s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=489.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=490.899s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm recognizing that, and I'm also proposing a way to help offset it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=494.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly think that we're smart enough to come up with a way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=524.169s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I could follow up, are you saying that if there's a field trip, let's suppose we're having two field trips as we are this year going to, or next year, Disney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=533.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So on one there's a student who has medical needs and needs a nurse, but on the other one there are no students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=540.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, in that case, what you're saying is that group of kids where the parent is having, where there's medical needs for one student have to share that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=550.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that other group of students, just because they happen to have none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=555.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, in my mind, I would rather say, hey, let's develop a policy where everybody kicks something in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=561.265s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=562.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody would benefit if there was a nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=564.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody would, I mean, I just think it's more equitable and I think it takes away the onus or the burden of a student feeling that they were costing their peers more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=682.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=683.971s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just, the point of information is that we just had a field trip presented to us at our last meeting where this issue was brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=694.297s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, uh, one, maybe it was a general,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=699.107s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a general idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=701.129s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.069s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, again, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=704.231s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I just, you know, the superintendent, I think that the motion is a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=708.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've asked him to develop something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=709.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally have feelings that I wish to express tonight and have done so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekoot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.792s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I should hasten to add, though, that if my colleagues were in agreement, I agree 100% with you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=871.655s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mistone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1997.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: are we going to take a are we going out for a photo yeah<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2231.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2231.316s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to get you out of here before it snows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2251.61s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but we'll do it at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2833.022s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think this actually is for the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2836.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As a school committee member, I was not aware that we had sustained urgent repairs due to pipe leaks at the high school and bursts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2844.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was that over the holiday break or was that in December when we, on that one cold snap we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2889.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, is that area repaired?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2905.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Has any section had to be closed down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2950.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2955.906s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm just thinking what's a minor versus an extraordinary repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2959.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what I was asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2962.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.05s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.17s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3646.29s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to go back to the discussion about the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3649.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the time we were doing the walkthroughs, Kathy Kreatz, my fellow school committee member and I, went to the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3657.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we submitted to the superintendent a list, including the bleachers, the clock, the things that you guys mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3665.974s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also at that point, because I don't remember, I'd gone to some other schools too, some of those very same things, the bleachers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3672.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: were on multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3673.936s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm thinking that that's part of the capital plan, because that's when we already talked about some of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3683.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we sort of got to the point where we were going together, and then the superintendent said, because it was difficult to bring us all together, go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3690.909s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Kathy and I just both happened to do that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3695.952s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4619.098s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to, I think the breakfast actually would be going up 40 cents per day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4624.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4625.222s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it $1.10 to $1.50?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4627.804s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So $2 a week times how many weeks are there in a school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4636.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So 30, 40 weeks, general 36, you know, times two bucks, 72 bucks in the year just for the breakfast increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4644.116s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's certainly with multiple kids adds up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4646.612s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: if your student is having breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4651.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this point, it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4654.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're not asking us to take any action tonight, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4656.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You can if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4767.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4772.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4774.515s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not asking for a subcommittee meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4778.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: on the rate hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4779.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I am asking, it was traditional that we met somewhere along the line during the school year with the school lunch people, and it seems like it's been a long time since we've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4792.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether at some point or another there used to be an advisory committee or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4797.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does any of that exist anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4809.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I'm not asking on it from a financial level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=712.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and taking over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=714.114s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When we voted on it last week, I put it forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=717.677s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I do think that there is a cost incurred and it's an appropriate cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=722.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that all of these services are completely free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=725.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So since you said free, I just don't want to mislead anybody in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=734.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So much based on what I've talked to her under right, but we'll get we'll get right I think he gave us the number Around 9,000 or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=824.58s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'm sure we'll have an opportunity later on to congratulate Mrs. DiCarlo and thank her for her work, but it would I can't let the moment pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=834.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's been an asset to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=836.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: She's a great lady, and we will certainly need to celebrate her tenure with us and her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1586.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent recently the D ESC put out some new I don't know they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1604.867s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and if the teacher, uh, had a elongated time out, there was an option other than, uh, attacking on school days at the end or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1613.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um I haven't read it completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1615.989s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was thinking that we would be talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1619.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I definitely think that I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1630.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: tricky in our community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1640.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1649.19s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1656.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see this not so much for the one or two day absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1659.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see this in the how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2124.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: under X. Means he'll be nice and close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3067.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have first the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3073.105s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It also included all of those booster clubs or Athletic support groups as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3081.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I Think September 1st is a bad day to pick Because it's you know often Labor Day weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3087.157s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th Okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3095.121s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3101.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like Mr. Superintendent, micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3113.22s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3114.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3115.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We just can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3116.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3117.263s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3122.726s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, or of which I, you know, belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever, that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3138.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to put that out there and say, it makes me real nervous when you went down that path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3144.922s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't think it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3147.364s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3155.01s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3159.846s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a principal sign-off sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3161.927s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3172.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3179.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3186.746s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, how formally you play them out is another thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3189.088s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3192.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because if you're a 501c3, you needed to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3196.134s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You needed to specify how the offices worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3201.738s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3212.54s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: any way otherwise than that I think that we can send it to send it off but those were some of my initial concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mister zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3320.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3325.175s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3330.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly, if you'd like to step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3593.026s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to raise money for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3612.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the money is raised, that the kids get the opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3633.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just think that it's really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3636.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, many of you won't remember this, and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3652.321s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3658.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3667.707s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they were all, blessedly, that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3675.471s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3680.653s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So within all of this in this discussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3684.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: By putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4587.352s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4588.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4588.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4592.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4602.534s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that you meant to be speaking up for parents and, in fact, were responding to parents' requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4609.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4610.916s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4615.056s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4618.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you meant to be heavy-handed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4620.577s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think you meant to be, cause this uproar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4623.378s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think so at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4625.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think you were inexperienced and, frankly, you learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4630.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because you see, you know that it's caused great upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4635.367s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That was very evident the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=799.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this actually goes to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=801.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not familiar with this clause that we've seen before, as my colleague said about requiring nursing coverage in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=810.324s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you speak to that at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=812.786s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Nursing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=822.414s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it on the first page?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=825.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw it when I read...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=829.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says cost per student, and it's mid, and it says this includes the cost of providing a nurse at $1,700.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=837.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when Haley spoke, she said that that's because in the new rules and regulations, if nursing is needed for one student on the trip, then the cost of that nurse is... Well, again, you know, one of the things that we face, and we faced this a couple of times, is that we can't deny a person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=881.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=882.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, I think that there should be a different way of doing it, because if I'm the student on the trip who needs a nurse, and I know that the year that I go, it's going to cost my fellow students more money, that feels extraordinarily awkward to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=900.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I don't think that we've looked at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=902.709s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to sort of see if there's another way that we could approach this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=907.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand what you're saying, what the issue is, but I'm uncomfortable with the way that this would work out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=914.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems to me that we ought to have some money aside, because you wouldn't want to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=920.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: the rest of the students feeling like my trip is more expensive because I had to provide nursing for someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=927.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it's just, it's just not, it's just uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=968.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm going to ask that you bring to us the new, um, policy that, that says this so that we can take a look at it in its entirety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=977.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Expressing my concern that this doesn't feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=980.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=981.258s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly have no reason to You know, it's not something that's going to affect this trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=986.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I certainly would make a motion that That we approve the trip this evening, but I would like to ask that we see that just Point of information to my colleague and working in another district I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1045.782s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I hear what you're saying, though, then it's saying that on all trips, whether it's the trip to Italy or the trip to- Overnight trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1054.307s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or whatever, that a nurse needs to go because she's there to provide- A possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1060.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: possibility of medical care for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1063.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's sort of different than the way it's been presented to us this evening, because I'm certainly sure that's, and I think that that's something that is incumbent on the school committee to discuss and make clear amongst ourselves in our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1137.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I understand all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1139.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's interesting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1140.399s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that the school committee should have the opportunity to discuss it a little bit further with the wording before us and the rest of the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1149.741s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because it needs to be included in our policy manual if we've updated a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1900.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1901.21s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had, for instance, some questions about the reporting of MCAS scores and other tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1906.776s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, for one of the things, actually for the vocational school kids in the past couple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1910.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They've done so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1913.014s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been nice to have them separate just to say, look how our students are succeeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1919.077s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was sort of curious about some of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1921.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also wanted to make sure that as we discuss this, that everybody understands that this is not a weakening of the vocational school in any way, shape, or at all, but in fact, all along,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1940.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've been working to strengthen the vocational school and our high school as well And the collaboration between them is what what we see does this but it's not necessarily Apparent, you know when you hear it it could certainly Be taken the wrong way So I think that's why it's very very important that we go and we have some more discussion on this so that we can very quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1965.84s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: clarify this to our community about what our future intentions might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3523.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3523.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3525.181s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, can I ask, is there – I think there's a little bit of a problem here, because as you're talking about standards, the committee is not familiar enough<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3535.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with each of the standards and knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3536.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's, it feels distant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3538.794s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and obviously our, our concern was, was that, um, we would be improving, uh, elementary science education, um, so that it impacted students quickly within this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3554.683s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there, for example, more hands on activities for students and are those, um, so as it's a great question, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3621.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you envision any sort of science nights where parents are being brought in and helped, how they can help their kids with science education the way we do for math and literacy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3636.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'm just a little bit concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3638.75s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was speaking with a group of parents and they told me that their child had never had a hands-on science activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3646.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, and I felt such an urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3650.274s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so that's part of what I'm trying to grasp here, uh, of trying to say is, is okay, how are we going to meet those needs sooner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3663.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what I'm concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4212.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4585.949s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5585.177s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, no, I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5586.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, do we need a roll call vote for this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5588.62s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1289.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We really appreciate that you've come down and this was just before my time on the school committee but I know that Leia's reputation was someone I heard of and was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1301.109s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: very very well known and very well respected so thank you so much and thank you for reminding us tonight during this holiday season of the tremendous people we've had in our past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2281.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just wanted to thank the parents for coming down and bringing the kids tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2285.775s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My favorite part was hearing the kids tell us about their projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2289.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, there's a whole lot going on at the Columbus School, and it's really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2294.219s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very familiar with the Little Free Libraries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2768.656s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would just like to take a moment to comment on remembering Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2773.261s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean was such an exceptional individual, a teacher who just loved what she did, a administrator and a community member, and lastly, a fighter who waged such an incredible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2785.508s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: fight and with such a wonderful, always upbeat, always lovely personality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2792.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just take a minute to remember Jean Barry because over the years in the school committee, she was certainly one of the first teachers that I got to know well and one who I certainly felt had a very large impact on our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2807.039s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remember her both professionally and personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=252.878s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Zigney, I waited all day today knowing that the students were going to be here, anticipating, knowing what joy you would bring us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=260.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was joy over the last two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=262.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I managed to attend every concert this winter season, and it was just thrilling, whether it's a group of 12 or, I don't know, 14 students you have tonight, or 125 or 30, I don't know, there's so many on the stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=275.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's amazing that you managed to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=278.244s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And Miss Cheng as well, wonderful concert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=280.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The choir concert was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CCxFra_yHK8&t=281.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They were absolutely fabulous and we're really proud of our students and thank you very much Mr. Zigny for bringing them to us tonight and always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.104s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=527.084s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just did have a question about the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=529.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=545.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=589.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=807.719s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you've said a lot of things and I need to tell you that as a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=813.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=819.647s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: because of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=824.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=830.436s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, if you would, divorce myself from the people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=835.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The statute says that we should be telling parents that there is a option for sanitation, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=845.484s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sterilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.185s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sterilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=847.826s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.346s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what the statute says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=850.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=854.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, um, uh, that they should be, um, that, that there is this option and it is an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=867.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I'm voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=868.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or, or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=875.144s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's, for me, it's a clear cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=877.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=879.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=883.969s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have any hidden agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1386.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1391.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: us that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1398.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1404.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1410.455s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1417.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1418.438s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1427.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1543.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to suggest we move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1623.201s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, may I ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1625.462s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1625.602s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1626.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it make any sense to suspend the rules to pick up the adoption of Medford Conversations Project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2472.495s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2479.08s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's why we're going to go ahead and say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2481.662s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2487.206s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents that were so outrageous to me personally of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2496.635s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: discrimination and, uh, inappropriate hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2500.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and one was, you know, I went to a craft show and I don't want to go into it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2505.218s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Although if anybody wants to know, I'll, I'll talk to you personally about what happened and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2512.821s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it is unleashed a firestorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2518.523s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2950.812s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, thank you Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2953.275s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I called Mr. Cieri today and unfortunately he didn't get back to me and now I know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2958.721s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I wanted to let him know that also in addition to that the Medford Educational Foundation just approved our grants and our grant cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2967.1s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of them is for materials for Medford's youngest learners in the kindergarten, for owl pellets across the kindergartens, across the city of Medford in every school, which if anybody hasn't done an owl pellet, you take the pellet apart and the kids find the things that the owl has eaten and it's all very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2985.954s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we've also approved one at the high school level, the remotely operated underwater vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2990.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are two things that will be added to the list and we've actually got one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2995.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that we're going to be talking to Mr. Cieri about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2997.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So he better get back here quickly, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2999.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, let him recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3740.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderclute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3741.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Beverly, would these be courses that a student is doing at home or during school time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3774.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can continue, does this particular product allow for a different usage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3780.559s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Say a student didn't fail the course but they got a D and now they're a senior and they're realizing that that D is really going to hurt them or that they really need the content of that course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3793.431s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way to use it as a review or possibly to improve their grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3896.767s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other question I have, the only thing that makes me uncomfortable in the protocol you've put forth is the absolute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3904.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3908.993s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My preference actually would be no outside of district programs will be accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3912.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for credit recovery unless approved by the assistant superintendent or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3919.483s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3920.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reason for that is because I think that you can't foresee everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3925.207s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there might be a reason why it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3927.749s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we're going to adopt this as a policy, my preference is for oversight and for the unexpected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3937.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would move if it's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3942.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by, and you can decide whether it's the assistant superintendent, the superintendent, the department head, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3999.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4000.093s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of guidance, that sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4533.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4533.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4534.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that I disagree with you that we don't, I mean we don't have any way to control it, but we certainly have a way or should think about how are we introducing to students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4546.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this issue of sexting and what the long-term and short-term ramifications are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4553.395s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe it was in that very article that you gave us last week, that excellent article that you gave us in our last folder, which talked about the uptick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4563.379s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it isn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4565.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4566.981s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the, you know, starting at middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4569.142s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think it's a very important conversation to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4572.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that I found on the Internet just this past week is whatever is, you know, someone had 1 times 9 equals 7, 2 times 9 equals 18, 3 times 9 equals 27, and it went on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4583.648s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then said, and the teacher put it on a blackboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4587.69s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And right away the kids started going, the teacher, you made a mistake, you made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4592.172s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And even though all the other ones were right,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4594.928s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only one that they talked about was the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4597.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when you do something wrong, I mean, it was such an easy how that can follow you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4601.835s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the thing that people see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4603.636s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought it was such a concrete example that should be presented to kids about saying, you know, this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4609.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you make that mistake and all of a sudden you write something out or you send a picture to somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4614.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: it's going to follow you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4616.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I don't think it's just, I think the policy that you presented to us, which we will need to follow up, is a piece of the puzzle, but it's not the entire puzzle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4627.839s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that what Mia is talking about, if I may, Mia, if I think, is sort of saying is how are we making sure that within the scope of our conversations as we seek to educate our kids about social and emotional issues, that sexting becomes part of the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4701.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we just need to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4704.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not hear that this is happening in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4708.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are hearing that there is a concern about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5058.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5059.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5060.769s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was surprised that you picked a Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=525.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=526.16s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=526.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just did have a question about the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=529.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=533.666s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=541.072s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=545.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=588.12s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=588.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=809.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've said a lot of things, and I need to tell you that as a school committee member, first of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years because of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents, that in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=830.335s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, if you would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=832.857s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: divorce myself from the people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=835.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The statute says that we should be telling parents that there is an option for sanitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=844.601s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=846.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, sterilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=847.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=848.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what the statute says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=849.983s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=854.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, that they should be, that there is this option and it is an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=866.891s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I'm voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=868.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=874.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=875.036s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's, for me, it's a clear cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=877.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=878.879s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=883.844s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have any hidden agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=885.685s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1386.715s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on us that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1398.531s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1404.057s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1410.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1417.046s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1419.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever, I want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1543.672s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to suggest we move the question, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1621.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1624.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, may I ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1625.509s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1625.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1626.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it make any sense to suspend the rules to pick up the adoption of Medford Conversations project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2470.366s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2470.526s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2472.427s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way, and that's why we're going to go ahead and say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2481.59s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford, but I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2491.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that were so outrageous to me personally of discrimination and inappropriate hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2500.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And one was, you know, I went to a craft show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2503.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't want to go into it here, although if anybody wants to know, I'll talk to you personally about what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2508.57s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2512.733s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it has unleashed a firestorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2518.437s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2675.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2675.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2675.935s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Shout out to my friend, Aaron, over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2679.556s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2682.377s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: AJ, as he's known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2950.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, thank you, Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2953.223s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I called Mr. Cieri today, and unfortunately, he didn't get back to me, and now I know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2958.665s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I wanted to let him know that also, in addition to that, the Medford Educational Foundation just approved our grants and our grant cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2967.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of them is for materials for Medford's youngest learners in the kindergarten, for owl pellets across the kindergartens, across the city of Medford in every school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2979.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody hasn't done an owl pellet, you take the pellet apart, and the kids find the things that the owl has eaten, and it's all very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2985.894s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we've also approved one at the high school level, the remotely operated underwater vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2990.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are two things that will be added to the list, and we've actually got one more that we're going to be talking to Mr. Cieri about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2997.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So he better get back here quickly, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2999.101s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, let him recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3741.194s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Beverly, would these be courses that a student is doing at home or during school time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3774.202s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can continue, does this particular product allow for a different usage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3780.505s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Say a student didn't fail the course but they got a D and now they're a senior and they're realizing that that D is really going to hurt them or that they really need the content of that course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3793.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way to use it as a review or possibly to improve their grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3896.714s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other question I have, the only thing that makes me uncomfortable in the protocol you've put forth is the absolute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3904.598s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: no outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3908.94s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My preference actually would be no outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3917.248s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, the assistant superintendent or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3919.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3919.991s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The reason for that is because I think that they're always, um, that you can't foresee everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3925.176s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And there might be a reason why it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3927.699s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, um, if we're going to adopt this as a policy, my preference is, um, for oversight and for the unexpected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3937.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would move if it's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3941.2s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: acceptable—will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by—and you can decide whether it's the assistant superintendent, the superintendent, the department head, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3986.833s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Oh, I think there's lots and lots of pluses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3989.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want, we can add that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4000.659s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4001.06s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4533.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4533.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4534.801s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that I disagree with you that we don't, I mean, we don't have any way to control it, but we certainly have a way or should think about how are we introducing to students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4546.698s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this issue of sexting and what the long-term and short-term ramifications are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4553.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe it was in that very article that you gave us last week, that excellent article that you gave us in our last folder, which talked about the uptick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4563.343s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it isn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4565.783s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4567.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the, you know, starting at middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4569.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think it's a very important conversation to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4572.028s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that I found on the internet just this past week is whatever is, you know, someone had 1 times 9 equals 7, 2 times 9 equals 18, 3 times 9 equals 27, and it went on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4583.596s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then said, and the teacher put it on a blackboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4587.638s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And right away the kids started going, the teacher, you made a mistake, you made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4592.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And even though all the other ones were right,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4594.877s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only one that they talked about was the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4597.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And when you do something wrong, I mean, it was such an easy, how that can follow you, that's the thing that people see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4603.582s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought it was such a concrete example that should be presented to kids about saying, you know, this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4609.446s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you make that mistake and all of a sudden you write something out or you send a picture to somebody, it's going to follow you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4617.791s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I don't think it's just, I think the policy that you presented to us, which we will need to follow up, is a piece of the puzzle, but it's not the entire puzzle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4627.799s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that what Mia is talking about, if I may, Mia, if I think, is sort of saying is how are we making sure that within the scope of our conversations as we seek to educate our kids about social and emotional issues, that sexting becomes part of the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4701.933s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we just need to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4704.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not hear that this is happening in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=958.179s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First, Miss Glasser, thank you for organizing this and working with our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=962.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=964.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious whether it's a private charter airline or a regular airline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=971.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All the major ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=973.394s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the Zika virus an issue in the Dominican Republic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1014.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My last question is, I'm just curious, it looks like you're going to be staying in the Central Mountain region at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1020.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are you staying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1022.765s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What sort of accommodations are the kids in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1080.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, as you're doing that, I'll just mention that I also went on a service trip to the Dominican Republic about five, six years ago, and it was an incredible experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1163.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe there's a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1165.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1974.313s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and I remember him at the pep rally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1976.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's so nice to have seen how he's grown and matured and now is giving back to our community in so many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1986.421s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I also just want to mention that while I was not able to attend, I know about Noah's interest in World War II memorabilia, and it's truly phenomenal, and so I'm really appreciative to him, son of school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2000.71s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Cathy Kreatz, that he is sharing that with people and I just think that's fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3374.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's also about networking, talking to other school committee members, talking, giving, having a chance to talk about issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3382.213s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with your colleagues while you're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3384.897s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's difficult because for me it was three days off from my own job, but it is really worthwhile in the long run and I hope that next year that more people will be able to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4492.217s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: – Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4493.357s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In looking at the data, there's one thing to me which is a little unclear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4497.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It uses the entire population, 4,529 students, but it doesn't break it down into levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4505.481s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so you could assume or jump to the conclusion that all of these things are taking place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4512.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the high school, which there are not many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4514.127s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to be clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4516.228s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's not necessarily true, or perhaps I don't have the data that tells me whether they're high school or middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4532.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the data, as far as I'm looking at it, would be more helpful if we were to break it down between elementary, middle, and high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=288.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This grant is now being released by the Commonwealth with applications due in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=311.627s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The committee then reconvened in the conference room to recap their tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=315.388s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent indicated that it will be necessary to consider the relocation of certain programs such as early childhood,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=321.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and office space to free up areas for program development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=325.214s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The committee will await follow-up materials to continue its capital planning for the complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=334.24s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I could just add, the tour and the vision that we were presented with at the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=341.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: was truly inspirational and very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=344.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And you take the step back and you realize you're not just looking at the smaller pieces of maintenance, which of course are extremely necessary, but kind of a bigger vision and a plan into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1995.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1996.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, it looks like it's going to be an interesting and exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2000.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as you guys know, I just attended the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2009.428s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: conference down at the Cape this past couple of days last week and it was all centered on social emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2016.756s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the truly exceptional parts that we heard about was from a woman who made just an incredible presentation and I would like to tell my colleagues more about it at a different point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2027.568s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, it looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2028.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2030.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2031.292s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: extremely happy to see that there is a workshop for the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2034.814s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2036.695s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I read the letter that was put out to faculty, and I realized that this had been something that I had caught at one point and then forgot about it, but it would seem to me that next year I would like that rather than teachers having to bring their own bag lunch that we could supply, the Medford Public Schools could supply lunch for our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2058.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: as a thank you, because somehow or another it strikes me when we're doing a day of professional development for our valued teachers that the least we could do is to say, hey, lunch is on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2071.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could put it in the form of a motion that next year at a professional development day, or if it comes later this day, that the Medford Public Schools would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2080.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I would provide lunch for our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2085.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think it would be a wonderful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2086.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2098.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2100.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2101.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry we couldn't do it this year, but at least next year it should happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2783.896s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, myself and school committee member Kathy Kreatz were able to attend the wonderful mock presidential debate and it was so much fun and our students just did such a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2797.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: They did a particularly good job in really trying to develop<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2802.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: really some understanding of what the candidates were putting forth for policy, which, as we all know, has sometimes been difficult this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2809.728s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, anyway, it was just, knock your socks off, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2814.63s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, well, the personas were just stunning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2817.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in the same handout, I just wanted to bring attention that the media students at MHS have developed a special video which takes a stand against domestic violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2828.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and because October was Domestic Violence Awareness Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2832.021s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Jack Dempsey, the media teacher, submitted a copy to the video to the MIAA, and though we didn't win this year, but remember we won last year, so someone else has to have a turn, they were so impressed with it, and that it's going to be used, be presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2847.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for their wellness educators workshop being held on December 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2851.723s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to the meeting tonight, I took a minute to go online and take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2855.605s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It is just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2857.887s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was just, it was really, it just really pulled at you emotionally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2863.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's simple, it's direct, it's just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2867.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make sure I mentioned that and congratulated the students and Mr. Dempsey for their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=997.096s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, I have to say that without any question of a doubt, and I'm sure the audience will all agree, that is the most positive thing that has happened during this election season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1799.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully submitted myself as chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3228.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think committee of the whole is the way to go initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3232.262s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, just to respond to your big ask, I think we should start that way because I know one of the concerns is when we get into who's going to be on the subcommittee, and we all want to be, or we have a subcommittee and then we all show up anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3245.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But then some people aren't really voting members versus whatever, so I think by starting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3251.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: this with a committee of the whole makes a lot of sense, and then perhaps we can move to decide whether a subcommittee makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3259.376s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not anti-subcommittee by any means, focused on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3264.018s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just understand what some of the challenges are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3267.959s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a lot of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3270.98s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think everybody's interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3272.32s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's one of the things, is we're all interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3612.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3613.466s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that, in fact, that this is only a small part of the grants that we gave out in these funding cycles, and President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3623.554s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ann Frenning-Cassooth and David Sayers, who's been the head of the Grants Committee, will be coming forward in a couple of weeks' time to tell you about some of the other grants that we funded either in the spring cycle or we are collecting grants right now and the applications are open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3640.478s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We decided to extend it to the end of October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3644.92s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3645.7s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3647.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really kind of fun to do something positive like this and we really, really appreciate all the teachers who write the grants and also it's been very, very helpful to be working so closely with the school district so that when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3663.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a question about is this consistent with our goals, educational goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4541.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if there's any way that we can advocate for that a five-year graduation rate also be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4551.931s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked on multiple occasions that everything has been based on a four-year graduation rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4559.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but we have had, as well as many other school systems, additional students who might take a little bit more time, but they do reach the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4567.717s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm wondering if, it mentions the high school graduation rates will still be, you know, part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4573.319s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering if there's any way that both the four-year and the five-year graduation rate could be included in when we provide data so that we can look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4616.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, my question is how do we move along the discussion of including the five-year graduation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4623.865s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the state and federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4719.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think that's something that our school committee could take as a responsibility of talking about this and bringing it forward when we attend meetings outside of Medford, and also within Medford too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5214.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the best is if we could just get to the core of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5219.174s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we can do so in one or two sentences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5355.614s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way that we should amend this resolution so that it covers our concern?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5362.66s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just looking as I read it, having heard your point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5880.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's obviously many, many different levels of conversation that we could have on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5885.701s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to strictly take mine to the financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5890.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, it costs Medford approximately $4 million to fund our charter school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5896.843s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have 10 students less than last year, but it's costing us $270,000 more this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5906.413s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5907.594s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because the state has underfunded the charter school account by $57 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5916.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This comes to one of those unfunded mandates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5919.675s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a question of how good charter schools are or how not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5922.856s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now we're simply talking about a funding mechanism and the number of charter schools that would be potentially approved by this would only have a greater impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5931.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, I certainly personally have been urging people to vote no on two because of the particular way the funding works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5940.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would urge the school committee to take a stand and say vote no on two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5955.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1477.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Our meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1479.831s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully submitted myself as chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2907.029s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2907.209s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2909.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think committee of the whole is the way to go initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2912.853s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, just to respond to your big ask, I think we should start that way because I know one of the concerns is when we get into who's going to be on the subcommittee and we all want to be or we have a subcommittee and then we all show up anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2926.003s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But then some people aren't really voting members versus whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2929.624s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think by starting this with a committee of the whole makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2934.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And then perhaps we can move to decide whether a subcommittee makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2939.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not anti-subcommittee by any means focused on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2944.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just understand what some of the challenges are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2948.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a lot of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2951.569s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think everybody's interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2952.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's one of the things is we're all interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3293.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3294.059s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that in fact that this is only a small part of the grants that we gave out in these funding cycles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3302.043s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And President Anne Frenning-Kassooth and David Sayers who's been the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3307.326s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Head of the Grants Committee will be coming forward in a couple of weeks time to tell you about some of the other grants that we funded either in the spring cycle or we are collecting grants right now and the applications are open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3321.106s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We decided to extend it to the end of October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3323.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3325.33s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3326.291s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3327.811s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really kind of fun to do something positive like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3331.553s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we really, really appreciate all the teachers who write the grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3337.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, it's been very, very helpful to be working so closely with the school district so that when there is a question about is this consistent with our goals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3347.542s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: educational goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3348.383s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have great people and great support, including helping everything work, so I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4219.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4221.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if there's any way that we can advocate for that a five-year graduation rate also be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4232.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked on multiple occasions that everything has been based on a four-year graduation rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4239.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: but we have had, as well as many other school systems, additional students who might take a little bit more time, but they do reach the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4248.365s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm wondering if, it mentions the high school graduation rates will still be, you know, part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4253.966s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering if there's any way that both the four-year and the five-year graduation rate could be included in when we provide data so that we can look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4266.91s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: success in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4297.336s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, my question is how do we move along the discussion of including the five-year graduation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4304.498s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: at the state and federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4399.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think that's something that our school committee could take as a responsibility of talking about this and bringing it forward when we attend meetings outside of Medford, and also within Medford too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4895.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is if we could just get to the core of it I think we can do so in one or two sentences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5035.23s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5035.41s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5036.271s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way that we should amend this resolution so that it covers our concern?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5043.957s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just looking as I read it, having heard your point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5561.404s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, there's obviously many, many different levels of conversation that we could have on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5566.368s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to strictly take mine to the financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5570.651s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, it costs Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5572.532s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: approximately $4 million to fund our charter school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5577.494s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We have 10 students less than last year, but it's costing us $270,000 more this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5587.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5588.257s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because the state has underfunded the charter school account by $57 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5595.955s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So this comes to one of those unfunded mandates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5600.339s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a question of how good charter schools are or how not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5603.522s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now we're simply talking about a funding mechanism and the number of charter schools that would be potentially approved by this would only have a greater impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5612.51s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, I certainly personally have been urging people to vote no on two because of the particular way the funding works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5621.418s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would urge the school committee to take a stand and say vote no on two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5635.942s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6579.712s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6581.232s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6907.426s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6907.626s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6908.247s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: While we're under suspension, I also just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6910.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In our packet, we received a reminder that our next meeting will be on October 24th at the superintendent's conference room to discuss the capital plan, and it will begin at 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6992.325s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the foyer, the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6995.533s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: is that it's also the National Honor Society Information Night, which is 6.30 to 7.30 in the Caron Theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7010.661s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that makes much more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1096.963s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1097.143s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1098.304s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I share my colleague's concern about the lack of notification to the parents to let them know what had occurred at school that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1105.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you that I still feel like I'm a little bit in the dark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1108.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand we very much want to protect the privacy of the students, but just a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1113.573s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I to understand were these two students fighting with each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1117.416s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1134.739s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they both happened to be in the same classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1178.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Did the students on these occasions hit either their classmates or was there any physical?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1200.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I also heard a mention of, and I know we had gotten a call about a student being taken out to the hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1207.763s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Was that one of these students who was taken out because this is what was deemed to be needed to, were they physically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1263.147s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1263.588s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But in this case there was a transport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1266.07s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I had a child in this class, I would have to say that I'd be very concerned because now they've witnessed two different kids have multiple incidents and would probably be concerned that my child would be thinking, what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1278.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm wondering, again, I realize how dicey it is around confidentiality, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1286.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: have people gone in and talked to the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1288.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have there been any small groups talking to the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1290.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounded like these kids are going to return to the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1295.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, as a parent, I can certainly understand why Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1299.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rodriguez would be concerned about what the plan going forth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1314.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1316.226s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1318.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have both kids been out, or are they both going to be returning at the same time, or do we have any?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1333.562s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1335.43s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think the communication issue is key, and I hear you not being particularly definitive, and I understand why, but understanding how this is going to be resolved so that the kids aren't so fearful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1356.178s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1356.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Rodriguez speaks about her own daughter, but I can flash back and understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1363.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: what it was like to be a parent when something happened in a classroom and know that kids do carry it with them sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1370.925s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And some kids carry it a lot more than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1373.267s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to worry about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1374.288s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I am a little concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2112.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2113.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The only problem with doing that is that we have ELL students then who have been at the Roberts for the younger grades, who have friendships, who are comfortable there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2121.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now we're, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2143.391s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but they would be moved out of that comfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2147.215s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, it's almost secondary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2149.618s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, I just have to say I disagree respectfully with you a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2155.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that the urge here is to up it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2158.006s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think that all the school committee members heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2160.809s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that events happened last week and parents weren't notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2165.572s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're into a new week and we're looking back and parent notification when there were incidents in the classroom that were of this serious, I believe should have happened in a much more timely manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2177.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So because it didn't, it's harder to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2181.047s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: feel great faith that everything will go forward in the best possible way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2187.67s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because for many of us, that's a stumbling block that we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2192.813s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2194.754s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard you saying you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2195.995s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2198.076s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Three motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2199.836s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2216.703s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2216.943s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, my motion must be slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2218.464s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that this isn't falling through the cracks for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2221.885s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion to make sure that we receive a report at our next school committee meeting and at our meeting after that so that we have some ongoing understanding of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2498.216s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: To mention that, I think that it's appropriate also to mention the wonderful celebration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2504.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: for the dedication of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, and to thank everybody in your office who was responsible to make it such a wonderful event, because it truly was great, and I know how much the people enjoyed it and appreciated it, and I felt very blessed to have been able to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2898.78s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm particularly happy to hear about the part which deals with the Brooks School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2904.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a group of parents from the Brooks who have met with former Mayor Mike McGlynn, brought their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2913.13s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This has been an ongoing issue for some time and it's very good to see that there is a resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2949.408s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2954.491s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And while we are under suspension, could I ask that we also address the addendum that we received this evening regarding the recommendation to accept a gift from Urban Sheds of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2965.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3372.789s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We received as an addendum in our packet a recommendation to accept gifts from Urban Sheds of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3379.333s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It asks that the Medford High School Garden Club<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3382.125s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: was asking permission to receive a donation of a garden shed from Urban Sheds of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3387.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they're going to build, they've offered to build a custom four by six foot shed in the inner courtyard adjacent to the garden free of charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3397.818s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, it's signed by Rhetta Smith, the Garden Club supervisor, the biology teacher, and the Medford High School Garden Club members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3407.405s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'd like to make a motion of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3409.748s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that the garden club be able to accept the gift of a shed from Urban Sheds, unless there's any concerns that I don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3582.456s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, now everybody's mic is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3708.432s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could we please send a letter of thanks to them an appreciation from the school committee members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3998.962s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I read through the material and I just wanted to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4001.945s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if a student does reveal information which is alarming, they will be told that what they're saying is not confidential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4012.355s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It depends on the level of harm risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4061.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I was thinking in particular about one of the questions was about getting into have you ever driven with anybody who's under the influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4068.774s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4069.154s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if a student says yes, my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4090.351s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll be very interested in hearing how this all works out and what the response is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5015.358s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say thank you for all the work that this entails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5018.72s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I went through it and saw how much work, because it's not only articulating them, it's also making sure that we're planning all of the appropriate activities that go along with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5030.83s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Does this need a motion of approval to approve the goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5036.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm guessing yes, so I'll make the motion to approve the goals, set forth the district priority educational goals for school year 2016-2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5045.686s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7136.238s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just had a question about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7137.679s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7138.579s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question was, I guess I didn't really understand one thing about the yes pass to the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7144.082s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, can they get the physical pass and loaded at an MBTA station or do they, do we have to, do they have to bring us the money to load?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7368.146s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8523.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam chair, since the results were just released this afternoon and school committee members have only received the preliminary report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8529.501s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that with the information that was provided so far, um, by, uh, the deputy superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8536.279s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that at this point, it seems like it would be appropriate for us to move this to a subcommittee meeting when the rest of the analysis has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8548.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd make a motion to move it to the curriculum subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8866.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8906.002s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I accept the nomination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8908.164s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And after discussion with Mr. Scurry, where he assures me, he will attend the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8911.606s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I nominate Mr. Scurry to be the delegate to the MAFC full conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1014.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1015.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was exactly my question, because I've also received calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1019.477s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just spoke to Diane about it, and I'd like her to come forward and give a clarification, because I was told that there were classes where there were 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1028.724s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I believe it was grade two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1030.706s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, I think it was the kindergarten as well, or 24 or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1036.25s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it does look, I do have to say, I do have a concern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1039.49s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: If you look at the numbers in kindergarten and look at the numbers in grade one, it looks like the average class size in kindergarten is higher, quite a bit higher than in grade one across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1053.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, it's always been, particularly in kindergarten, that those were the places where we're looking, you know, for low numbers and in, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1063.708s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the Roberts, even with average class size, 21.5, so there's 22 kids in the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1069.09s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a lot of little five-year-olds all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1072.451s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I am concerned about our kindergarten numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1075.912s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane, could you address the concern about the numbers at the Roberts specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1137.045s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1144.249s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are the teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1146.673s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do they feel that's a very amenable way to divide the children fairly, or is that causing... I mean, I understand, but clearly there were parents who were reacting to it, so I'm somewhat curious about the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1189.564s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1191.205s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure what to think yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1192.866s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess part of it depends on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1195.131s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How many more kids come into the district in those classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1200.475s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you been receiving concerns, Diane?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1238.849s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1856.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to go back to some of the numbers and if I could ask Diane to come forward again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1863.158s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Diane, there is a difficulty here because we're sort of seeing numbers and, you know, it's kind of us second-guessing the principles, which we understand the fallacy of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1871.77s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I could probably make a strongest argument supporting the way that Mr. Johnson divvies up kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1877.941s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: saying it may be in fact the most equitable way, because we all know that one very difficult student, a teacher might prefer three easy students in comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1889.45s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it does raise some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1891.512s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the questions I see elsewhere is that at the Columbus on the first grade, we are as class size as low as 14 students, while the kindergarten is up to 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1900.779s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And playing around,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1904.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I almost wondered, gee, would we have better off to have an extra kindergarten teacher and divide it up in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1911.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm curious why that decision was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1963.153s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Do all of those teachers at the Columbus School have full-time aides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1972.597s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So three out of four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1973.537s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And does the fourth teacher have the same 21 kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1987.083s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you know, again, looking at the number, I think that that's where we might be saying, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1992.742s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand the superintendent saying, look, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2005.956s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got great class sizes, and I've certainly spoken to other people in other towns, and I know we have great class sizes, but still, my expectation was more that they're in the 17-18 range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2016.26s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: When I see going up to 22, that's definitely concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2021.622s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In the Roberts School, one of the things I want to ask you about the kindergarten class specifically, since the principal told us that, you know, are there any kindergarten classrooms with 24 or 25?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2033.487s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2034.668s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so they're divided equitably?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2037.631s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2049.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2050.04s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2050.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2052.122s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I mean, if I look at this sheet at the second grade, it says average class size 22, but you've told me that there's some with 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2061.409s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I look at kindergarten,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2062.938s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It says average class size 21.5, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2066.639s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So would one kindergarten class have 20 and the other have 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2069.099s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2069.999s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2072.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2077.341s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I really think that looking at the numbers, we might look at how that Columbus, that one class which doesn't have a kindergarten aid in equity seems like a need there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2090.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At the Columbus School, you mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2090.924s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2091.264s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2250.552s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2250.732s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanden Heuvel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2251.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2252.332s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You're all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2252.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4683.081s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just also think the report was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4685.183s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is one of those good news reports, and it's important that we that we hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4689.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I particularly also liked hearing, you know, that there was a challenge and that's and we're looking at our summer school for grades six and seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4698.034s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that's very valuable for us to hear as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4700.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate the delivery of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4703.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5288.055s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I have it at home, but I don't know which of the three days the delegate assembly is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5292.538s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5307.528s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to be the alternate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5625.472s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also just like to add a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5627.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Tonight, before the school committee, the members of the school committee were down at the McGlynn and Andrews property, which, as you know, is on Freedom Way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5639.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was named Freedom Way because our schools opened in 2001 on 9-10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5649.932s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And on Tuesday morning, I happened to be there dropping off my child and, you know, doing those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5657.155s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was sitting outside of the Andrews School that I had my radio on and heard the report and went into the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5664.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so as I sit there and sat, and of course this being such a, you know, important anniversary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5670.0s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: The schools to me are also so very closely tied to that memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5674.141s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And our commitment to each and every one of our students and families in Medford to have a free, wonderful education, because that is what I think is the most important thing in our democracy for all our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=756.473s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask a question about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=757.913s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=758.233s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderhoof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=760.234s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please tell us what you're replacing the curbing with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=762.914s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that was a higher cost item that was going to be looked at in terms of the capital improvement plan when we spoke about it last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=772.617s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm curious, since we've already seen that curbing had a problem,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=779.058s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering what you're replacing it with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=804.832s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So how are we correcting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=812.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the same type of curb?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=814.46s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a stronger material though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=817.422s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Because what, obviously my question is what's going to prevent that, the same thing from happening again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=823.347s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I definitely thought we were looking at a different material completely, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=827.11s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=831.113s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.035s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.996s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we'll discuss this, I guess, with capital improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=840.079s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in essence, this is step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.36s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.841s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: A temporary fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1182.441s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, I just want to request that when that happens all the school committee members are informed of when there might be an opportunity to view it so that it's not, so that we can all have access to that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1371.284s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1372.204s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You just mentioned dye lots, and that hit upon another concern I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1376.967s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm really glad painting is taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1379.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned the McGlynn in particular, but I was concerned because we spent hours and hours and days and months when we initially picked out colors, and I'm under the impression that there's no longer existing paint from the original project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1397.518s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wondered what paint you used, how you match colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1411.547s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And they still make them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2302.972s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2303.152s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, so, you know, obviously it makes sense to go through this tonight, but I think that as a committee member, my expectation was that we would be visiting the schools and walking them and looking at them perhaps more intensely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2316.755s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's my first comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2318.135s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My second comment is when we hit, if you just kind of look at some of the money in the columns, you know, a lot of the, I always thought that if we were going to do a capital improvement plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2329.997s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We would be putting more money in year one and not waiting until year four to get to playground surfacing or some of these other things, which we've talked about for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2340.463s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm a little surprised at how they're skewed so late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2693.543s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought we were going to have to go through the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2785.15s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: As I look down the list, perhaps I thought we were going to read through the list first, but one of the questions that pops out to me is skateboard area deconstructed and modular units installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2800.273s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and you know we've not discussed that, why are we installing modular units, why would we be doing that, why is it on a priority list, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2858.452s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so I don't even know how to address all of that in the context of this plan right now because there's many, many different questions embedded in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2866.555s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I see it as one of the things that administration has put down on this capital planning list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2875.338s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But as a school committee member sort of understanding that the whole impetus or urgency or not or whatever, that's just simply not clear at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3372.461s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the appropriate thing to say is that we appreciate her very much and so we're not going to let her go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3376.282s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to tie you up and we're just going to keep you here because we need you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3380.644s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've just been so fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3382.805s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We adore you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3506.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3508.35s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you just heard us talk about capital planning and putting together a capital planning plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3515.736s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What experience do you have in doing something similar and what were your thoughts as we were discussing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3567.589s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've already seen we're talking a bunch and we all have our own concerns and agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3574.975s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And obviously you would report to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3578.118s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But we're here too and we're very interested in what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3581.44s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you handle that balance for the need of school committee members who approach you for information, which we do with Pat all the time, versus your report to the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3626.269s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What would you do if you disagreed with him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4313.3s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4663.42s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My question was actually going to be on the mayor's follow-up question, which is if we had a situation where here in the city of Medford your role would be part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4758.855s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'm going to go back to the superintendent school committee relations and I'm going to ask you what your expectations of both the superintendent and the school committee is and and how you've worked with them in your previous positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4817.762s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, have you seen our budget books, like for the budget for this school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4822.883s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Not for FY17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4823.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I have reviewed prior budgets online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4827.905s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And is it similar, was it similar in your previous position that you would put together, be responsible for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6150.565s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What do you see as the most challenging part of this new job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6183.052s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you had experience in collective bargaining?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6251.911s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And lastly, was it typical for you to attend, I don't, in Fitchburg, is it town meeting or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6259.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6260.434s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Council meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6272.898s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You've heard that here it's very typical for our Director of Finance and Administration to attend every school committee meeting, multiple other meetings, and to stay late often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6282.485s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7958.586s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane, do you attend every school committee meeting in Arlington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7995.758s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: That's interesting that that's something you negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7997.82s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Here it is customary, more often than not, that our finance director is at our meetings or at our beck and call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8005.645s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that sort of leads me to the second question is, what are your expectations regarding your relationship, both with the superintendent, your boss, if you would, and the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8016.488s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And how has that worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8019.071s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know in Cambridge, I'm not sure whether you had direct contact with the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8052.773s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask why this position in Medford interests you and why you would be leaving Arlington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8058.496s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8180.166s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I have heard about town meetings in Arlington, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8184.208s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I did want to ask you one thing about your resume, and I'm not even sure if you know this, but under every single job experience you've had, it says, please do not contact this employer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8224.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8224.718s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a funny thing because on it, it feels kind of negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8227.359s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was why I was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8230.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8239.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8240.286s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8240.727s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much for explaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8241.787s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Robert Evans, Scary Junior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8785.947s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8790.089s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8791.85s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: You gave us a number of students in Arlington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8793.951s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: What is their budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8816.39s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wondered, in terms of the transportation routes, you mentioned special ed, which I'll set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8856.411s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and I guess the last question is I'd like you to tell me about a difficult situation which you faced in Arlington and how you resolved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8865.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Fiscal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8866.961s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Behavioral?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8868.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to let you pick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8869.203s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9072.255s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm not going to make that mistake a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9075.318s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane, you know our motto, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9077.6s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: On time and on budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9079.221s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9080.702s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: After my own heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=491.482s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So prior to our budget night, I had no idea that we were moving in this direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=498.687s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We hadn't really been apprised of this along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=502.289s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really understand whether this requires a vote of the school committee to affirm the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=509.353s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if it's a decision or it's just what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=513.536s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you perhaps explain that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=534.087s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So just out of curiosity, are there other options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=537.048s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is this the option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=559.657s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=562.278s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'd like to ask, uh, Mr. Maloney, whether any sports will be impacted, for example, uh, will right now our swimming season is during the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=574.382s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, but I know some schools have different swimming seasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=579.163s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So does anybody, anything change for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=612.681s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1533.64s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And just one, on the registered MPS booster organizations will be allowed available times, times not otherwise booked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1541.444s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, booked by when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1544.025s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we talking a week in advance, two weeks in advance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1546.406s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: How?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1565.349s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1609.252s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not paying for field workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1611.032s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And the money is going directly to the programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1613.393s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1613.893s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1614.593s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2568.544s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to thank the superintendent for putting the report together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2573.869s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it gives us a, it's good to have this outline for us and in our records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2580.374s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to accept the paper and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3076.34s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So in the past, it's been customary that the superintendent has sent us out a report on or about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3083.713s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: August 1st to 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3085.595s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that actually is not specified in this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3089.078s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So while it says that you will give us updates, I'd like to formalize it and say that there will be a midsummer report will be sent out to the committee by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3249.102s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: My feeling about it is I've always found that sort of mid-August report really valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3255.984s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not really looking for a meeting to happen August 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3261.186s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd be more inclined to have a meeting the third week of August or, you know, the next week before, you know, either right prior to school or now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3272.629s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, we start school before vacation, but I think we're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3276.128s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: before Labor Day, but not necessarily midsummer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3279.771s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: August 1st is, you know, I think it should be a little bit later than that, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3847.37s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I think one of the things that was very clear was that there was such an agreement when your name was brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3858.469s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, amongst the parents, amongst the faculty, and amongst the school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3863.513s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We had, as school committee members, had the opportunity, well, in some ways to watch you grow personally, but also to have you present to us on any number of times and to see you actually working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3875.982s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would, it was a classic no-brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3878.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4307.356s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4308.497s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I spoke to Pat on the way in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4311.751s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: and noted that in the letter that it specified to be spent on new musical equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4317.915s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think it would be better to deposit back to the school department to be used by the fine arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4328.521s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of the needs that we heard last week from the band director was not necessarily musical equipment, but there were other needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4335.646s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to give us more leeway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4344.094s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Music department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4345.457s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Music department is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4465.168s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to address the budget modifications that the superintendent has given us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4471.47s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In my mind, the superintendent has met the concerns that the school committee seemed fairly much in unison, as different as we all are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4486.287s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: there was a theme and these were definitely the ones that I was most concerned about and heard others speak to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4492.868s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm very, very happy to see that money has been found for these, what I consider to be necessary items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4502.97s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion that the school committee affirm the Medford Public Schools budget for the year 2017<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4515.197s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: with the inclusion of these budget modifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6068.561s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6071.822s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I just want to add one thing in that for the Paris that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6075.435s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: are brought in from special education, that's also part of the IEP process of determining whether a particular student, what they need or how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6088.184s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's where it's sort of spelled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6091.986s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I just really wanted to say that the other night when we did our budget, I think that there was some level of frustration because obviously we had needs or desires that we thought were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6105.095s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6106.256s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know, Mia, at some point you said, what is the point of all this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6111.48s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And kind of said, you know, there is a level of trust working with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6119.145s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But the point of all of it was we went through the budget and we identified key areas that we believed were critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6127.051s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And that there was a real purpose to that work the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6131.854s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And now you've seen the fruition of it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6135.8s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we're also saying and realizing, you know, again, this budget is a, you sort of set the bottom line, but there was movement with it depending on what the needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6146.525s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a static document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6836.042s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would make more sense if the fourth quarter, is it the third quarter, would be part, would be the budget report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6846.766s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're not preparing five, you're doing quarterly reports, and one of them is with the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6857.486s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I see, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6937.225s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7252.5s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So given the adjustments that were made, I'm not quite sure why my colleagues now have voted against it, the two that did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7262.864s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, too, was looking for unity because that is what we want to go into and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7271.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I do understand that people might have preferences, and I'm sure, for example, that many of my colleagues would, in fact, like to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7279.007s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: said we're going to do kindergarten aides across the city all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7284.852s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a very large budget with many other things, very important things to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7290.816s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've added an English teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7292.838s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We've added lots of different elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7299.283s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the committee has spoken and said, yes, there is a desire in the future to add that we're starting out with the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7306.608s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a level three school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7309.123s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: justification for why we're starting in this particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7312.848s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I hasten to remind everybody that when we get to kindergarten aids, the money, the dollars seem short, but the obligation of the city in terms of the additional finances for healthcare are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7327.354s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that the beginnings of this budget and on that particular issue have been addressed, and it's clearly been heard that there is a desire to increase as we go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7347.682s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I share with the superintendent frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7351.064s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I know the other night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7355.111s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I had hoped to have a unified budget, and there were some levels of consternation because there were so many things that weren't clear, and tonight we've now clarified those in, I think, a very, very positive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7373.74s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I for one would ask my colleagues to reconsider their vote, and I would like to have a discussion and see, because I'm not quite sure if that's the only issue that's outstanding, and I'm not understanding something else for that negative vote by my colleagues, that I would urge you to reconsider, because a budget is a huge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7398.108s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Entity, it is not a one issue question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7402.211s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: We are here for the good of all of our students, whether they're in kindergarten or whether they're in a high school senior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7409.697s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Every student is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7411.558s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And to hold up that unity on a budget because of one issue, especially when so much progress has been made, I believe is not in the best interest of the public schools and the children and families we serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7746.873s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7748.474s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor, I wouldn't want anyone to think that we couldn't vote, certainly as we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7753.939s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just that, quite honestly, I was surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7757.041s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to make it clear, by the way, that there have been years where I have voted against the budget because I was concerned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7763.919s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: that the entire budget level was short, and that we were not meeting the needs of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7770.623s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So please understand that it's not, that I've never, that I've always been in agreement with the bottom line, but that's really the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7778.068s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: In some ways, it's the ultimate bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7780.87s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't understand why my colleagues voted against it, and that's why I said what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7785.372s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: I am wondering, since the superintendent has made a statement sort of saying, geez, I'd rather go in with a unified force,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7794.777s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: whether there was a point in my asking for reconsideration so that we could vote it again if any colleague had a feeling that they were persuaded for some sense of unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7807.872s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: But if there's not, then I respect your votes, and I'm not going to bother for a reconsideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7813.621s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just trying to sort of feel out whether either of my colleagues who voted against the budget wanted to reconsider their thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8103.692s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Madam Mayor, just to conclude the discussion, then, I certainly want to express to my two colleagues that I appreciate their due diligence, and I respect their votes, even if I disagree with it and would have preferred it a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8116.019s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: However, even though, Erin, you've asked many questions, and I can know some of your areas of concern, I still was surprised, because I thought we were more on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8126.806s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Now that you've articulated exactly where you're coming from, I appreciate it, I understand it, and I now understand the vote better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8134.439s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you and we'll, if we could, did we call the vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8138.385s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>
